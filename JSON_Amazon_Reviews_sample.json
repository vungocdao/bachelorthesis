   "Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game the music I heard plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well led me to purchase the soundtrack and it remains one of my favorite albums There is an incredible mix of fun epic and emotional songs Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like as theres not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks I must admit that one of the songs LifeA Distant Promise has brought tears to my eyes on many occasionsMy one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs which I find distracting But even if those werent included I would still consider the collection worth it"
