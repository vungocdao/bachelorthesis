1,Contrary to other reviews I have zero complaints about the service or the prices I have been getting tire service here for the past  years now and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys these guys are experienced and know what theyre doing  Also this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of just because of my gender Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars and have sucked my bank account dry But here my service and road coverage has all been well explained  and let up to me to decide  And they just renovated the waiting room It looks a lot better than it did in previous years,0.08095238095238097,0.4523809523809524
-1,Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on They fixed it for free and the very next morning I had the same issue I called to complain and the manager didnt even apologize So frustrated Never going back  They seem overpriced too,0.015426997245179071,0.2829889807162535

-1,The food is good Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss The main issue seems to be with the kitchen the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and its pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints,0.1074074074074074,0.4925925925925926
1,Even when we didnt have a car Filenes Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront I always find something usually I find  things and spend about  and better still I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes  months later   I kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburg,0.3583333333333333,0.3416666666666666
