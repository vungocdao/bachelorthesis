"2,""Contrary to other reviews, I have zero complaints about the service or the prices. I have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now, and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys, these guys are experienced and know what they're doing. \nAlso, this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of, just because of my gender. Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry.

"1,""Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \""""Are you working?\"""" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it."""
"1,""I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \""""games\"""", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets."""
"2,""Like any Barnes & Noble, it has a nice comfy cafe, and a large selection of books.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They stock a decent selection, and the prices are pretty reasonable.

"1,""Stars are for the food only.    2.5 rating\n\nGot there at 8pm on Saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick. \n\nThe service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.  \n\nI think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation."""

"1,""When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    \n\nThis review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. \n\nAt BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT\""""S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:\n\nI bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says \""""Should be ready in a few days\"""". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would \""""duke it over\"""" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?"""

"1,""Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?"""

"2,""This is by far, the BEST soft serve ice cream place in southwestern PA. The \""""flavor of the week\"""" is always interesting-and tasty! Though, I am somewhat disappointed that they've switched to a lower grade ice milk, for their vanilla and chocolate offerings.

Either way, this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of DQ, Tastee Freeze, etc. It's definitely worth the trip. It's mostly street parking, though they do have about 3-4 parking spaces off to the side. Serving sizes are huge! The small cone here, is the same size as a DQ large.

I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.\n\nWe ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces. \n\nThen we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. \n\nThe tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. \n\nFinally the diver scallops.  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it.

"2,""As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.\n\nTasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because \""""your parents teach you good to talk Chineees\"""". \n\nI'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now.

Then, when he diagnoses your car, he'll explain it to you like you're not an idiot, and he'll make sure you understand what's going on. He's incredibly honest and cares about his customers. For instance, once I had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn't have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in, then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it, and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it.

"2,""When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.\n\nThe hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.  \n\nService was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.\n\nWe ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!\n\nThe second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.\n\nLake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!\n\nFinally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.\n\nOur experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!"""

Also, the desserts are mandatory!  \n\nThe duck confit gnocchi is smashing-- it's a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savory--and my favorite is probably the Casbah Double-Cut Pork Chop: super-yum comfort food.  The short rib ravioli is some pot-roasty Goodness, and the long island duck is another great choice.  \n\nA nice surprise here are the great happy hour specials at the bar.

As for the meal itself, we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up.\n\nOur waiter was courteous and provided good, fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering, which was quite nice.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique.\n\nFollowing the cheese tray, I dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia.  Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked, particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.\n\nI'd recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good, out of the ordinary food."""

"1,""And so....the search for a new hair salon continues. Sigh. Don't get me wrong, the cut was a good cut. The salon itself was clean and stylish. The owner, welcoming and friendly. \n\nNow what went wrong. The cut was good, but it certainly wasn't what I expected from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn't bowled over by my stylist's professionalism either. Don't diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don't do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.  (And come on, I was WAAAYYYY overdue for a cut since I've been driving to Cleveland for a style.)  That being said, for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas, tolls, lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal. But, when I started to sign the charge slip, it said $65, not $55. \""""But,\"""" I said, \""""the website said it was $55 for a Master stylist.\"""" \""""Oh,\"""" the chick at the counter said, \""""that's for Men's cuts.\"""" Silly me. \n\nSo when I got back to the office, I went online and checked. Nope, it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN's haircut. Hmmmmm. So I called. The chick at the counter now said, \""""Oh, our stylist's charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be.\"""" What?????? So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again. \""""Oh, well.....I'll refund you $10 if you give me your credit card number.\"""" Didn't she have my slip with the card number? \""""Sorry, I don't give my credit card number over the phone.\"""" \""""Or I can send you a gift certificate.\"""" \""""Nope,\"""" I said through clenched teeth, \""""I won't be coming back.\""""\n\nIt wasn't the cut. It was the bait and switch. I'd gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time. As Judge Judy says, \""""Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.\"""" \n\nThe search goes on. Or I'll be back in Cleveland in the spring for the next cut!\n\nP. S.  One amusing side note:  I checked in at Izzazu when I arrived.  Turns out, I'm the Duchess!  The Duchess is displeased."""
"2,""Page's is a Pittsburgh icon. The ice cream is good, the selection is vast, and the price is right. They have so many different things to try, it's nearly impossible to choose. I'm a big fan of the cookie sundae, brownie sundae, and cinnamon roll sundae. The options at this place are pretty much endless. But sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go. It's better than Dairy Queen, AND you support a local business by going here. What more could you ask for. \n\nI don't know if I would say that Page's has particularly superior soft serve, but it's the experience and variety that makes this a four star place. I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. \n\nFor those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside. I prefer to open the back of my SUV, sit there and enjoy the night while I eat my ice cream. The parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes. I typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason. \n\nBeware, they only accept cash. But there is an ATM on site!"""
"1,""The first time I went here was with a group - we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party.   I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.\n\nThis time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the \""""get together\"""" than the food/location.\n\nThis time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.

"1,""I recently bought my first motorcycle (a 2001 KTM Duke II) and found Bohn's when searching online for KTM dealers. I went in with the intention of buying a jacket, helmet and gloves. Their store is pretty nice inside, and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though). \n\nI wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the \""""hated\"""" that jacket and that the liner was \""""nothing more than a glorified garbage bag.\"""" Ok...\n\nWe also talked to a guy at the register about a '96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I'm not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?\n\nEven after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.\n\nI wanted to like this place, but between the thinly-veiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff, I don't think I'll ever return. Their prices and selection are pretty decent, so if you are in the area and know what you want, it might be OK to stop by and pick something up. If you have any alternative, though, I would avoid this place."""
"2,""Fun bar, and instead of typical bar food they lean towards Greek dishes. The blue grass jam on Wednesdays is a lot of fun and not too loud to still enjoy a conversation. Decent beer prices, pretty good selection."""
"1,""Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \""""what's going on here\"""" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \""""Uh-oh\"""".  The menu is huge with a number of \""""slow-food\"""" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""""bacon\"""" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""""meat\"""".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"""".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return."""

The gem and mineral exhibit was huge. And the art museum had a surprisingly awesome collection - I was thrilled to see a couple Van Goghs, Monets, Cezannes, etc.\nThe only exhibit I didn't much care for was the temporary art exhbit - some contemporary craziness that involved body parts dangling from the ceiling.. at least it gave us something to talk about.\nAll in all I did not spend nearly as much time here as I could have and would have liked. I highly recommend this for anyone visiting Pittsburgh."""

"1,""I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.\n\nI had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly."""

"1,""Okay so I tried this place twice before writing a review to give them a fair shot. Unfortunately, the second visit wasn't any better.\n\nI will start with the good. Service is pretty good.\n\nThe place smells of smoke. Why? Because you can smoke in the bar and there is an opening from the bar into the restaurant. This has to be a violation of the no smoking in dining areas in Pittsburgh. Gross. \n\nThe floor (carpeted) is so old that it is sticky and worn down. Walking on it with shoes on disgusted me. The walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place. Please, remodel! At least make me feel like the place is clean. If I feel like it is dirty in the dining hall, I can't imagine it's clean in the kitchen.\n\nNow for the food. I am pretty picky about seafood. It needs to be fresh and cooked correctly. Don't get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very fishy to me. Salmon that tastes overly fishy, to me, screams \""""this fish is not fresh\"""". Mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes. Don't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes. I get it, you wanna have a mom and pop shop. But to do that you need to have great food.\n\nOverall, I just don't think this place is good, and don't want to go back."""

"1,""Being born and raised into an all Italian family, I'm pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the unknowing). My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.\n\nSorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.\n\nOkay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant.

"1,""I booked a hair apt here after reading some of the reviews on Yelp, hoping I'd find a place to get my hair cut after moving to Pittsburgh from NJ. Maybe it was just the hairdresser I booked an appointment with, but I did not have a great experience. I'm a nurse who works mostly day shifts, and I value sleep over styling my hair in the morning. I tried to articulate that I wanted a hair cut that required minimal styling on my part. The hairdresser immediately shot me down, asking me how I expected to have my hair look nice if I wasn't willing to put work into it. She then berated me for not using styling products-- again, I'd rather sleep. \n\nNow, maybe a few people feel differently about their hair, but all I wanted was a cut that allowed for minimal styling on my part.

"1,""Hotel restaurant/bars are usually not known for being the best in town.

No,  but you know that better is out there.  \n\nThe blackened chicken wrap was boring.  The flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland.  Also, white tortillas just do not do it for me.  Why does it seem that Pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty, flavorless food?\n\nUpon ordering the caesar salad on New Year's Eve, I was told that the restaurant has no non- or low-fat dressing option...at all.  However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.\n\nOn the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.  The turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.\n\nI also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).\n\nThe drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.  \n\nService on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.\n\nThere are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.  \n\nI think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?  \n\nPro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors, this does not make any sense.  But, it is what it is so do not forget your key!"""

"2,""The store is small, but it carries specialties that are difficult to find in Pittsburgh. I was particularly excited to find middle eastern chili sauce and chocolate covered Turkish delights."""
"2,""Boy do I miss Primate Bros.  I remember going there when the packing district was coming alive at 3 and 4 a.m.  We were coming back from a night of being out 'n about with friends (this was in high school/college summers in the mid-70's).  We would order wild concoction in sandwiches with french fries IN them.  I liked the place so much I bought and wore proudly one of their T-shirts...but alas...left it with a native friend (she also liked it alot) in Koh Samui Thailand."""
"2,""Salami and cheese is so amazing. Best food in the city!"""
"1,""It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't good. \n\nAs soon as we walked in the door the place was jammed back with people who were not interested in seating anyone or telling anyone they would be seated. On one side of the restaurant there were literally two girls working, and one of them was pregnant. You can imagine the chaos. I wanted to have this \""""Pittsburgh\"""" experience that I've heard so much about but honestly I was more than underwhelmed. \n\nAfter being seated, it took the waitress 10 minutes to get around to actually saying hello to us and in between that time a large group of people decided to squeeze in a booth behind our table making my friend having to get up every time a waitress or another person needed to squeeze back there.\n\nThe sandwich at best was mediocre. The coleslaw was a bit too vinegary for my tastes and became sickening after the first half of the sandwich. I needed a lot of ketchup to even finish the sandwich. Not to mention I got a nice souvenier of vinegary smelling hands afterwards. \n\nIf you're a tourist, go do it to say you had a colossal sandwich and lived the \""""Pittsburgh\"""" experience. Apart from that, I don't know why you'd return."""
"2,""a classic. nothing else to say"""
"1,""Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \n\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\n\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \n\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \""""bacon\"""" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \n\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food."""
"2,""When there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, but they did a pretty damn good job. Maybe not the best sandwich I've ever had in my life, but if it was any random sandwich shop I'd happened to stumble into, it would definitely be five stars without a second thought.\n\nThe chili cheese fries were among the best I've ever had. I don't know what they do to them - it's not the chili that's particularly great, it's not the cheese that's particularly great, and it's not the fries that are particularly great. But somehow, putting them all together just turns it into unbeatable awesome.\n\nThe sandwich itself (I got the corned beef) was very good despite the fact that I hate coleslaw. But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw"
"1,""I've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time, new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes, at 15 I walked.  Not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   Tonight, the waiter seemed mad that I didn't know what I wanted to order.  After I explained that I'd never been there, he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Haha."""
"1,""This place holds a nostalgic appeal for people born and raised in Pittsburgh who grew up eating here. If that experience is what your looking for, please visit. If you're looking for a tasty meal, go somewhere else. 5 stars for history, 0 for food quality and flavor."""
"2,""Awesome tortillas, awesome salsa, pretty good selection of Latin American food products (mostly Mexican, but lots of S./Central American and Caribbean).  I'm spoiled from all the Hispanic grocery stores in Atlanta, but this is the best one I've found in the 'burgh.  Prices are average for the Strip and Pittsburgh, but a little high for a Hispanic grocery store."""
"2,""Even a NYer was telling me to get tacos here, so I did. Pretty good. Loaded more than I'm used to. They make their own tortillas which is respectable. It's fun to watch people order tacos here, this is a real taste of Mexico, and it seemed new to half of them. Pittsburgh is a great town because the vendors aren't afraid to give the people something real - they even have tongue. \n\nThat chinese food truck across the street though.... it's good, but way Americanized."""
"2,""Yes, I went and had the tacos. YES, the lengua tacos. YES, I KNOW!!! They were good. Did you also know that you can buy homemade tortilla chips in hella bulk, along with any kind of sauce you can imagine? If you suddenly need plantains for a questionable contribution to a fireside potluck, you can get those here, too. I'm not sure what else you can really ask for in a Mexican food store. Nope, pretty sure they've got it all. Oh, if you buy a plantain that is pitch-black, or you find that your plantains at home have gone pitch-black, simply slice them open, place in oven, bake until warm and tender, then spread with guava paste (available at Reyna Foods). So the man at the counter tells me. True story."""
"2,""love the lobster roll.  buttery delicious stuff.  the crab/spin/artichoke dip was also yummy.  i'll go back and try other dishes.  so far so good"""
"2,""I went here for the first time on Saturday night. I had to go & try the famous Giant Fish Sandwich! When it arrived, I was impressed. The fish was even bigger than I expected & the batter was perfect. Also, the beer menu is lengthy! They serve beers from almost every corner of the world! I thought about trying something new, but turns out I was homesick for a good old Pennsylvania beer... :) Roland's is definitely a cool place in my book. I'll be back! :P"""
"1,""I hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn't eat here.  But after reading the other reviews, I thought \""""Eh, what the hell.\""""\n\nWe came in and were seated at 5:45pm for desserts/drinks.   By 6:05, we still hadn't seen our waitress.  We decided it wasn't worth it and just left.\n\nI did eat here a month ago, and yes -- the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy.  And then to pay around $20 for that?  LOL.  Right.\n\nI won't be back."""
"2,""The people aren't lying. This lobster roll is drenched in butter and guaranteed to be a key contributor in your untimely death. You better love it or leave it alone."""
"1,""There were 3 of us on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly Roland's was 3/4 full. With 3 waitresses. They were RUNNING to fill orders. \nThe fish was hot and crispy. It was fried but it was good. The French fries with it tasted as if they were fried in the same grease or an oil that should've been changed several days ago. \nThe Mussels were OK. \nBut the Clams Casino were inedible. The clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping. The crab cakes were also bad. Both went back.  The waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine. \nThe New England Clam Chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup. \nNo, we won't go back..the food was lackluster(better fix at Wholleys) and the service was terrible. It took 20 minutes to get someone to take the bill."""
"1,""Prime time location, and they know it.\n\nYet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it.  The place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city.  I have always steered clear of Roland's because of an assumption.  But....the wife and her friend wanted a \""""lobster roll\"""" so I was roped into going.  I opted to just drink a draught.  They got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed.  The sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries (the best part).  It also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw?!  The roll itself was lobster, but was fishy tasting and had no sauce?!  There was maybe 3ozs of fishy lobster on the roll.....Pathetic.\nService was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves.\n\nGo to Wholey!!!!"""
"1,""If 0 stars were possible I'd give em. Got back from here yesterday evening and I am physically ill. \n\nI didn't even touch the anemic, yellow and fishy smelling muscles - not that the waiter asked why we hadn't eaten them, more on this character in a moment. My ahi tuna steak was decent, but I think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well. Just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off.\n\nSpeaking of the waiter - one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of umm being served by? That sounds awkward and vaguely jack-assy ... Hmm the mild poisoning I have is affecting my wit, but you follow me.\n\nThis guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down, and didn't notice or say anything about it when he did"
"1,""Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.\n\nWe parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!\n\nPerfect. \n\nMy mother got the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'. The bread, from Mancini's, was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini's bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty, no doubt , I mean, lobster is just - good. For the price though, not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair), way too much horseradish, and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!\n\nAnd it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off. So, needless to say, not the best experience.\n\nTalk about false advertisement..."""
"1,""WARNING ,,,,, this place is for SUCKERS ONLY ..... funky smelling ,worse tasting seafood ... overpriced ..... raunchy,un-clean restrooms .... only reason anyone goes here is because this is a ''tourist trap '' type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything.

"1,""I liked the bar.   The food not at all. First time here, wife and I sat at the bar and people watched over some WELL POURED drinks.   Strong point.  Then we screwed up and ordered food.   I got their infamous lobster roll.  Glad I had a drink.  Overcooked and dry, dry, dry. I thought lobster roll was generally made with a lobster salad-like mix.  This lobster was dry and chewy.  Lots of it, though  I guess that accounts for the high price.   I went down to Wholeys and got a much tastier one for 5 bucks.  And wife's nachos were just a big pile of chips with some toppings thrown on the top.  Then the other day,  we went back and I tried pizza.  Yuck.  The toppings were terrible (pepperoni, sausage.  how can youscrew that up, but they did.)  Two slices and boxed it up so as not to hurt the waitress' feelings.  But it went into the trashcan down the street.  Go for the hootch and not the food!!"""
"1,""I would give them ZERO stars if it were an option. No one came to wait on us. I had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter. We'll call him Mr. Personality because he never did tell us his name. I should have known we were in trouble when he didn't bother to write down our order. My Caesar salad came without the requested onions. My grilled salmon was overcooked. The vegetables were bland. The waiter took away my half-empty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water. He never offered us dessert. The rest rooms were filthy. I would never recommend this place to anyone."""
"2,""I can't believe this place got a bad rating!!! Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!!\nWhy would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place. \nI live about a block away from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!!\nSure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. \nThe food is absolutely amazing!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling. \nI always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. \nThe pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce. \nI bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there. \nThere is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some \""""unsavories\"""" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant.

"1,""Sorry, but I stopped in this morning to get my lunch because I knew I would be too busy to go out for lunch.  Got a Greek Salad.  First of all, there was no lid on the salad, it was wrapped in plastic wrap... What??? Anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble.  Second when I went to eat it, I threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown and/or wilted.  Not going back again.  I didn't spend all that money for garbage."""
"2,""The Sicilian Pizza is huge, tasty, crusty on the outside, soft in the middle.  The regular thin crust pizza was loaded with toppings.\n\nMy only complaint is that the Pizza was served luke warm.

Both the cooks and the waitress were friendly."""
"1,""This place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising. Some of the food was good and others were sub-par.\n\nTwo of us ate the gyro platter which comes with: \nhummus (watery) \npita (store bought) \ngyro meat (I've never had gyro meat like this before, it was ultra thin and had a rubbery texture - also the portion was so small) \nGreek salad (iceberg with sparse toppings and too much dressing) \ngrape leaves (vegetarian but quite good) \nand rice (actually this was the tastiest thing on the platter - it had a nice lemon and chicken broth flavor). \n\nOverall the food was hit or miss. The most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat. My companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable. I think diners come for the cake which was eaten by almost every person in the joint. \n\nI also have to agree with some of the other reviewers, this place is disgustingly dirty. All patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross. The kitchen was not clean and our waiter had food on his hands when he served us. \n\nEven homemade wine and honey soaked cake won't bring me back again."""
"1,""There has to be better Italian food in Pittsburgh -- I don't know why anyone would come here.\n\nI had an overnight field trip with my students to Pittsburgh & the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show.  They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy & also since the students were loud.\n\nTheir service is a hot mess!!!!  They only had 2 waiters serving our 50 person group & it was not organized at all.  Just getting our drinks out was confusing.  The waiters just came out with any drink & then asked -- anyone order this??  This is why my table sat drinkless, breadless, & saladless for the longest time.\n\nFor our dinner, we were given a salad, entree, & tiramisu.  The salad was definitely straight out of the bag & doused with some cheap dressing.  It didn't taste fresh at all.  There was a list of 8 or so entrees we could choose from.  They came out quite haphazardly.  I unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever.  I could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar.  I tried to douse it with pepper & cheese but alas it did nothing to help it.  Some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked.  The tiramisu also was gross.  It definitely was made & cut awhile ago & just kept cold in their fridge.\n\nThe redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor & old fashioned coin operated games AND the mystery show.  I've never been to one & was really excited.  They started after we ate our entrees & intermissioned during dessert.  The actors were super funny & interactive -- my students loved them which of course makes me happy.  Seriously though, their food is so bad."""
"1,""Came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building. No host/ess, no wandering servers, no customers... We had to search the place for someone to seat us and the first people we ran into were a couple of off-duty servers who were rolling silverware. The male kindly sat us and got our drinks for us. It took a ridiculously long time for our server to even appear at our table and just as long for our food to come out. To make everything worse, the only other couple in the restaurant who were sitting behind us were complaining to the server about their food. The server returned to their table a bit later (no manager) and said that \""""the manager\"""" told him that since the food is made early in the day, it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served. WHAT? Seriously???? It was hard to enjoy our food at all by the time it arrived.\n\nThe food left much the be desired. The service was the worst I've ever encountered. I don't usually leave complaints on restaurant websites but I had to leave one for this terrible visit. They gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. Needless to say we did not return to redeem it."""
"2,""Really marvelous art presented in a beautiful setting.  The gift shop is one of the best in the city.  They feature crafts from artists around the world and local.

"1,""The location of Redfin Blues is great! It overlooks the river, and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks... However, the food and service is sub par. Each time that I have been here, whether it be an extremely bustling Saturday evening, or a slow weekday afternoon, the service has been poor. The food is average, and is way overpriced. There are many other great places in Pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich. \n\nRedfin Blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant! But with the poor service and average food, it has a lot to yearn for."""
"2,""4 stars for the atmosphere. There are not many places in Pittsburgh to dine along the water and the outdoor seating at Redfin Blues is fantastic-huge outdoor deck with lots of tables under umbrellas. It was the perfect venture for Sunday Funday and I don't know why I have never been here before-well it is pretty hidden. They have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself.  It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.  It was only 3pm so we went with an appetizer of cheese fries with bacon and ranch-delicious and how could you go wrong! The fries had a tasty seasoning on them."""
"2,""The steaks here are very good.  It's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  However, I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  That's something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  I love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  I had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn't that good.  The  bartenders are competent, but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  It's kind of an afterthought it seems.  Oh yeah, and they don't have Guiness on tap.  I'm going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are okay, but they certainly aren't noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay, but I think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.  Overall a very fine experience.  I'd rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners Mortons, Capital Grille,  Ruth Chris, Hyde Park.  And, for bar area and bar dining Capital Grille, Hyde Park, Mortons, Ruth Chris."""
"2,""I wavered between 4 and 5 stars here. If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the deal...\n\nI love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the food is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. \n\nOur reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. \n\nOur waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:\n\n- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. \n\n-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.\n\n- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.\n\n- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...\n\n- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.\n\nSo, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, \""""Where the hell is the waitress with our check?\"""" \n\nThat said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)"""
"1,""Apparently I wasn't important enough with my lunch burger order (even though it was $16.95...) because my server did not come back to see if it was cooked medium, which it certainly was NOT. When I FINALLY got a chance to ask about it, she acted indignant that I would question her then checked her pad, yes, I ordered medium. Then she stared at me. Stared. \n\nI have to say, I have never felt smaller in any restaurant experience in my life. Extremely disappointing and appalling. Will give our business to Capital Grille from now on. I urge you to do the same."""
"2,""My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we went into that night. (we didn't even have a drink at the second one) And it was by far our favorite. Not a lot of female patroons so if you're a lady on the prowl, I would probably go somewhere else. But if you just want to relax in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere with some decent music, this is the place!\n\nThere were two bartenders and we happened to sit on Jeff's side. I'm sure they were both quite capable but Jeff was amazing at making us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up. Even then, he made sure we were taken care of. He's pretty much amazing and has great eyebrows.\n\nI guess there was some craziness and fighting by the door and outside as the night got later but we never saw it and it didn't clear out the whole bar. I would expect a downtown bar to have a few problems and it seemed like they were taken care of efficiently. No strikes there.\n\nWe stuck to beers and the prices were very reasonable considering the downtown location. Apparently happy hour runs until midnight! We were able to both have some drinks on the cheap and listen some good music. Definitely returning whenever we're there again!"""
"2,""So fun to have a place like this in the Strip.  I just found out that they have chocolate oranges - I look for these in all the stores during Christmas and never thought to come here - well they have white, milk, and dark chocolate varieties available year-round.  I love the dark chocolate, but only because I didn't know the other two kinds existed!  They also have canisters of malted milk balls, unique chocolates from all over, seasonal items, and a cafe-ish area.  I didn't try the hot chocolate, but I hear it's a must-have.\n\nWhile we walked around the small store, three different salespeople asked if we were finding everything okay - possibly because I kept taking pictures to Instagram and I didn't realize until after I left that there's a sign asking patrons not to take pictures. Ooops!  But no one said anything and they were polite, so thumbs up for the service here."""
"2,""Cheap! doesn't necessarily mean bad - at least not here at the Stan's Market. However, you will definitely have to check, double check and triple check on some occasions before you buy anything.\n\nWe stop here twice a month to do our groceries - mostly for less likely perishable produce like the garlic, ginger, peppers, baby cucumbers. However, we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis. If you happen to buy some of the soft fruits like the strawberries, blue berries or the grapes - you will most likely need to finish it up with in a day or two. If not, you can always freeze them to make smoothies.\n\nLet me say this again, this place is cheap. The prices I pay for the produce here are usually 1/3 of the price I pay at Giant Eagle. So, if you know your produce - this is definitely the place to stop."""
"2,""I stayed three nights here on business and really enjoyed the hotel and its staff. The place felt clean, up-to-date, and comfortable. All the staff were friendly and everything was easy, from check-in to check-out. \n\nThe rooms have high ceilings and were nicely furnished, and the 3rd floor courtyard even had its own bbq for guest use, which seemed like a nice thought. \n\nI'd stay there again for sure."""
"1,""Ok, but they do not go out of their way to help! I didn't have a credit card so at first they said I couldn't check in. Finally they allowed me to put down cash. Then I went to breakfast, and the shuttle refused to pick us up because \""""roads were too bad\"""" We waited for 45 minutes at the restaurant. No cabs could pick us up, so I called the hotel and explained our situation (had to get to work soon, 5 mth pregnant woman with me, only a mile and a half away). He said he couldn't help. We had to walk while the snow blew in our faces. When we were almost there, we saw the shuttle pull out with the smoking shuttle driver in it, driving in the opposite direction, away from us. I cannot believe how rude they were"""
"1,""Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile ."""
"2,""Excellent food, nice beverages, more than fair prices, & great service. Waitress remembered us & was a doll. Owner Elias is a delightful gent & such a really welcoming character. We'll be back. Very pleased."""
"1,""Terrible. The food they brought us didn't match what was on the menu. They brought out a different wine then we ordered and didn't tell us until we ask. They messed up out bill. They didn't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy. The beer was skanked. The soda was flat. Possible the worst restaurant I was ever in."""
"1,""Worst experience at a restaurant ever.  I don't need anything fancy but this was pathetic.  My coke was colored water, when I sent it back she said they just changed it.  Came back and said we don't have coke, would you like a sprite.  The sprite was flat but I was afraid to order a water after that.  Why didn't we just leave then.  The menu had quite a few spelling errors we joked about but no joke - don't go here.  If I could rate this a zero, I would."""
"2,""We showed up after a Pirates game to keep the buzz rolling, and this place did the trick. 22-ounce Yuenglings for $4? My kind of place. There were plenty of sports on the tellie, some really kickin' alt rock music, and one of the friendliest crowds of all time. That adds up to a hell of a bar in my book."""
"2,""My mom called me so giddy on the phone today, I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery.  No.  Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived.  It made her just as happy.  \n\nShe and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair.  The fabric was not inexpensive.  Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric, some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less.  However, they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process.  And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there.\n\nMy parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator.  Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building.  They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so.  They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back.  These are the kinds of things that make a big difference."""
"2,""This place was noted as a \""""must visit\"""" location during my last trip to Pittsburgh. I must say, it was definitely worth the visit. \n\nTo all reading this, be aware that essentially, this is just a grocery store we're talking about here. However, the rustic building, and kitchy offerings (like pour your own olive oil...or taste our 100cheeses) makes it kind of special. \n\nWhen I was given this recommendation, I was told \""""head to the back to where the cheese is\"""". So, I did. WHOA - so much more cheese than I ever expected. But no macaroni and cheese....boo. \n\nThey should really consider serving mac and cheese. \n\nThat's all."""
"2,""The cheese counter and \""""Dear Heart\"""" really are treasures.  They have all manner of fancy aged gruyeres, tons of olives, and even some sort of disgusting concoction called \""""pepperoni cheese\"""".  In any case, the place is all kinds of old-world beautiful.  Shelf after shelf of yummy goods, Italian imports...yum."""
"2,""My family has been coming to Penn Mac for as long as I can remember. My parents make monthly trips to stock up on their very large array of cheeses. The prices are fantastic. For example, parmigiano reggiano at Whole Foods is 19.99 per lb"
"2,""Unlike many historic theaters across the country, the Harris Theater has been lovingly restored, and is actually a great place to watch a movie.  In a past life, it showed porno movies.  Now it screens eclectic art-house films and other smart selections programmed by PGH Filmmakers.\n\nLocated on Liberty Street downtown, the theater is easily accessible via public transportation.  The concessions are cheap, and the seats are comfy.  What more could you ask for?"""
"1,""After two visits to this theater this week, I want to yellp:  turn up the volume! Or seriously look into purchasing new audio equipment, easier said than done, I know. I felt as though I could hear every movement of audience members and the sound of crunching popcorn made me laugh out loud for some reason, but the point is that I was distracted and did not at all feel immersed in the wonderful film in view."""
"2,""I adore Prestogeorge. They've got a ton of freshly roasted coffees, which is great. Also? Lots and lots of loose-leaf tea. I may be willing to admit a small tea addiction, and this is one of my favorite places to try something new. I've given coffee and tea from here as gifts and they've always been well-received"
"2,""I liked the decor of the place.  When I lived in Pittsburgh 3 years ago, I was just out of college with no money and didn't care what I ate.  So I spent a lot of time eating bar food, pizza, and $1 pierogies.  I never knew there were \""""fancy\"""" restaurants until I returned this week for work!\n\nI got the salad with pears & gouda which was delicious with a ton of cheese.  I also had the octopus appetizer as a meal - I was surprised, it's much chewier than I expected.  But the vinaigrette on it was tasty and the red potatoes and kalamata olives gave it a lot of flavor.  The fruity sorbet was good as well.  \n\nI though the service was great and the waiters didn't laugh at me for not knowing half the words on the menu.  They were more than willing to explain!"""
"2,""Get the pasta trio, you won't regret it.  Big heaping portions of fresh pasta delivered to your plate as soon as you have space available. Mmm.  And we went on a Saturday night with no reservations and we're seated in 5 minutes."""
"1,""My girlfriend REALLY hyped this place up but I ended up spending $110 on a terrible meal I couldn't even eat. I ordered the Chicken Marsala (Waitress's favorite) and it was disgusting. The sauce was VERY over powering and it was drenched in it. If that wasn't bad enough the Chicken was cheap dark meat with the skin and the bones on it. I ended up leaving even though our meals included a dessert with the price. Won't be going back here..."""
"1,""Minimalist happy hour.  Bartenders rude (and it was slow- early in the afternoon). Ran our tab on the card to hold the check without asking if that's what we wanted to do. Chicks in bikinis on the street trying to get people to come in.  Prices too high for strip district beer.  Smelly.  Upstairs looks like it's a club at night.  Rough crowd started to come in as we were leaving.  Good for a quick beer and that's about it."""
"2,""Mushroom cheesesteak with a Stewart's root beer for lunch today. Freshly made, toasted bun, all good! Friendly service."""
"2,""The reason for this update is the service.  The hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.  All solid four stars.  I was a bit disappointed initially with some of the pre-arrangements.  In the past I was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.  Friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check/ carving station/ etc.  Now, with that being said the service was over the top 5+++ stars from start to finish.  I get there and am running a bit late. I ask the bellboy Eric how long for a shoe shine, he states its pretty much an overnight service.  I tell him I'm in a rush.  He runs downstairs and shines them himself, done in 30 minutes.  While I'm waiting my contact for the night Ryan Hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine.  The party goes off without a hitch, great staff, good food, some discounted wines and good premium open bar.  After the hotel party we are walking outside and run into Eric (bellboy) again ask for directions to other club, instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.  One of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.  He ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.  Btw, did I mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.  The next morning I get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.  Everything about this place is three to four stars.  My main pet peeves are the valet cost ($17 and $25 overnight).  There lack of flexibility in food/bev minimums, but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.  You can't go wrong in Pittsburgh for an event at this spot."""
"2,""Staying in this hotel changed my entire view on the city of Pittsburgh!  The hotel is in an extremely vibrant area and I am not embarrassed to admit that Pittsburgh is pretty damn cool.  The rooms in this hotel are clean and the staff is fantastic.  If you're driving, parking is conveniently located across the street, though the parking garage should come with a set of directions on exactly where to pay when you leave the building (or maybe I'm just more obtuse than the average parker).  \n\nThe hotel restaurant has pretty good food and the bar is a great place to hang out and have some snacks (the house-made chips are addictive) and enjoy a nice drink.  And if you have the great pleasure of having Sam as your bartender, you're definitely guaranteed good conversation and a few laughs.  Just make sure you bring up Justin Bieber--she really loves that little fella...."""
"2,""Great location, Front Desk Staff were very personable. Be prepared to hear fireworks from PNC Park it is right across the river. There is a parking deck across the street with very reasonable rates. My husband and I had a great time here."""
"2,""My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but still service incoming guests. \n\nCheck in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.\n\nWe had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.\n\nOther than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far."""
"1,""We got this hotel room via Hotwire at a great price.\n\nThe location was good, although not close to where we were headed while in town. It was easily accessible to the highway. Parking at the hotel is expensive.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that our shower wasn't clean. The walls in the rooms were thin"
"1,""My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the North Shore area, which was a short car ride away. We got a very good rate on Hotwire--otherwise I don't think we would have been able to stay here. Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location, we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.\n\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\n\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\n\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal."""
"1,""Really poor service and way overpriced. You could make much better choices.They do not keep to a high standard of service.\nThe rooms are not worth the money."""
"1,""I had great expectations that were sadly not met. For the price of the room, I was expecting a LOT more for my buck, maybe I was just too optimistic. I will say the whole hotel was clean and didn't have any unsanitary conditions. But it just seemed outdate for the top price paid, it could use a spruce up. Our room was ready before posted check-in time and when we got to the room there were no problems. The wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good. I would say this is an average hotel for amenities with a high price tag.\n Usually when you pay top tier rates, I usually expect the service staff to be very friendly, didn't get that here, I think I had one of the service staff actually talk to me unsolicited. I would not revisit The Westin Convention Center.\n My wife would probably give it 4 star just for the shower head, it was pretty amazing, but when that is the highlight, I don't think there is value here."""
"2,""I've always loved this hotel. Lovely location right by the river, near enough to the sports venues for a pretty easy walk over the bridges.\n\nCheck in was pleasant as I've always experienced here, staff were all very friendly and helpful.\n\nRooms were clean but could use a bit of updating"
"2,""A friendly place with great seafood.  It is cash only. The clam chowder was meaty and creamy.  The onion rings were crispy and so was the fish. A nice place to see local flair"""
"1,""This place is defiantly a historic site! From the floor to the table tops to the bathrooms! I love learning about the history of how places came about. Mary the bartender gave me lots of info.......oldest bar, 1st one to let women in, same flooring, etc. \n\nThe food is frozen so if you're looking for fresh seafood this ain't it! I had one of their famous oysters.  Very good I highly recommend getting only 3 very filling. I had the special crab cakes & 2 sides. Imitation crab & lots of filling. So I don't need to tell you how nasty that was. My house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor. \n\nI did notice-after I ordered-everyone was getting the fish sandwich. So I was like dang! I should've ordered that. My return is questionable. If I go back its only going be for the fish sandwich & oysters!"""
"1,""A friend of mine and I thought we would meet for lunch one Wednesday. I'm a fan of Thai food so I thought we would give the Lemon Grass Cafe a try. We arrived a little before noon and were seated promptly. That was the best part of the experience. It took an hour to receive our food. AN HOUR on a busy Wednesday lunch break. There was no sorry, we're working on it ... etc. No explanation at all was given. The food was meh. I've had much better. I would not recommend this place to anyone. \n\nAs we were walking out a lady was waiting for her takeout order, which she called ahead about. And it wasn't ready yet and she had been waiting over 20 minutes for it. Terrible terrible customer service."""
"2,""Wow, I'm surprised no one has left a review for this place yet. I've been here quite a number of times and I've never been disappointed. Service is good and the food is wonderful. This is the closest thing to getting Chinese food from D.C.  You definitely have to get the general tso's chicken. I drove all the way to get some food from here during last years horrible winter storm. When you have a craving, you have a craving."""
"2,""Great spot for weird or obscure parts, general maintenance items, and to  borrow a wrench or two.  Gerry is like a wise eccentric uncle.   I remember going there for my first time in the early 90's and it hasn't changed in almost 20 years."""

"2,""I don't care for the lunch buffet because of its limited options (mostly potatoes and beans for vegetarians, sometimes some previously frozen veggie medleys) and lack of spice (for understandable reasons), but for dinner, especially take out, I give Peoples 4 stars. \n\nI usually get either Baingan Bartha or Aloo Gobi, as well as a dal and a plain naan. The dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two. I've tried to stop letting that perplex me, but I can never remember the one they don't have and often try to order it. Maybe my take out menu is outdated in that I should cross that one out. Ok, now on to important stuff...I order a spice level of 10 out of 10. The results are dynamite! Instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil, I can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice. They also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes. Each bite is a mouth explosion. And I love mouth explosions! \n\nThis restaurant has it's shortcomings, but since it's the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure, I am a big fan."""
"2,""I am in town for work and I decided to order food from here. The food was awesome! I ordered the People's Special Biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room. I will definitely order from here again the next time I'm in town."""
"2,""First of all, a disclaimer. The only thing I have ever ordered here is the Pho Tai. I spent a semester in Vietnam eating Pho on an almost-daily basis, and now it is my comfort food, what I want when I am sick, tired, or sad.\nThat said, I can recommend the Pho Tai without hesitation. Out of the 3 Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh (this, Vietnam's Pho, and My Ngoc), this has the best pho. The broth is quite good"
"2,""If there were an option to give an extra star for a \""""special\"""" experience, I would surely do so for Golden Razor. I must confess that I have a really thick beard and my stubble would surely light a match. Well but it did meet its match out here.

"2,""I just moved to the area and went here for the first time the other day. Tomaso did a great job! I high recommend this place."""
"2,""If you were to base 7 Cees as a restaurant it definitely will get one star.   However this place is known as a grease spoon dive.  That is exactly what it is and by far the very best dive diner that I have ever been too.        \n\n Jeanie is great.  She will be your greeter, your hostess, your waitresses, your personal cook, your bus person, and your cashier.  whew!!!!  Jeanie is not a jeannie in a bottle. She cannot snap her fingers so that your meal magically will appear in front of you.  She is the only person that I have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food.\n\n Her cooking area is quite small.  Trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it.   Jeanie does swear like a sailor, but in a quiet mild manner and NOT like a raging lunatic.  When you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.    Trust me I  hate it with a passion when people swear, but with Jeanie, it is okay.\n\n But with Jeanie, you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force.  However while Jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and sweet heart.  She will make your order the way you want it.  Beware!!!!!  The portions are huge!!!!!   The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable. \n\n So why only four stars when it should really be a five.  Well as I mention Jeanie's swearing like a sailor is part of the 7 Cees experience.  I can deal with hearing damn, mf, shit,  etc.  I cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words.  When people say Jesus Christ name or God followed by the d word....

"1,""In theory, Tessaro's is exactly what you want -- a casual neighborhood joint in a great location with an acclaimed product. In practice, it's not very pleasant to go there. I don't think they want us there. Every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward.\n\nThe burger itself  -- the actual cooked meat -- is indeed good, but they have no interest in all the other stuff that turns cooked meat into a hamburger experience.  The buns are poor quality"
"2,""Loved this place.  Wasn't sure what to expect.  My cousin told me that they had the best burger in Pittsburgh.  Well, Ria, you were right!   Done to perfection, exactly the way I asked for it.  Not only was the burger great, the potato salad with came with it was just wonderful.  I think  Tessaro's will be on our list of go to places from now on!"""
"1,""I just don't understand the appeal.  I've tried this place twice thinking that I somehow had a \""""lemon\"""" of a burger the first time.  And then returned a few months later.  Nope.  The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh, but where the hell is the flavor?  I can go as far as saying that I don't believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.  If I closed my eyes, it is possible that I wouldn't even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you're used to eating 99 cent burgers, Sysco \""""meat,\"""" or at chain restaurants, then you would find this to be \""""amazing.\""""  I've had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics, but definitely above average, especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren't for them.  Additionally, the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it's current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it's past accolades."""
"2,""Tessaro's, I kept hearing, was the best burger joint in the burgh. The award, in my opinion, is still up in the air. I have quite a few more places to check out!\n\nA huge plus to Tessaro's for their kitchen! Wow is that thing small. And the two guys working were rolling the burger patties right through the window. AHHH MAZING! I also heard Tessaro's butchers their own meat on site. I love hearing this. \n\nTessaro's is definitely worth checking out. The lunch crowd gets a bit tight as their tables are close. Perhaps try a bit before or after the average lunch hour. Oh, and they aren't open on Sundays so steer clear of that day."""
"2,""A ton of people told me to try this place, so I went.\n\nIt's very different than most restaurants. The place is old school, but so friendly. My pal and I had a great time! We got burgers of course. We are used to bold flavors and crazy combinations"

Also, my diet coke tasted funny and lack carbonation. My nephew ordered a grilled cheese and I thought they would use the local Sancholi bread, but no. "
"2,""Free wing Fridays... oh yeah.  I don't even like wings usually, but Silky's knows how to cook 'em so they don't taste fatty.  Get a side of Atomic sauce, which is flavorful as well as hot.  I'd buy it by the bottle if I could.  The menu is huge, and everything I've had has been good.  I always get the home fries on the side, which are cooked with onions and fried jalapenos (!).  Great waitresses, too.  Would be five stars if it had decent air conditioning--in the summer, sitting inside is painful."""

"2,""I haven't found Thai food that blew me away in Pittsburgh, but the waiter here was incredibly friendly, and my mock duck dish was solidly tasty."""
"1,""I surmised two things from my visit to Thai Cuisine:\n\na) the competition among thai restaurants must not be very stiff in this town\n\nb) yinzers wouldn't know good thai food if it flew into their open mouths\n\nThis place was horrible. My fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what you'd find at a church fish-fry. Insipid, over-battered and generally unpleasant. My dining partner's masaman curry was so sickly sweet it tasted like melted coconut ice cream. Surprisingly, the joint was slammed. \n\nOn the bright side, service was very fast. On the downside, our waitress was definitely stressed out and cranky possibly from waiting on the 14-top of inebriated co-eds across the room from us.\n\nThe takeaway: If you're from Pittsburgh, you'll probably love this place -- it was packed with your kinsmen when I was there. But if you've enjoyed quality thai food in any large coastal metropolis, steer clear.\n\np.s. food was needlessly pricey given the poor quality."""
"1,""A year later, prices have increased 70% and the quality of food have declined. Customer service is still superb though. Today, I ordered a pad-see-yew with beef level 5 - was made in an old pan with burnt scraps, 25% beef in dish only, there were clumps of chili not blended in the dish, and was drenched in oil. Another dish, red curry with chicken, was always lacking chicken pieces, they've increased prices and cut back on portions and quality, which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad. Sad to say, this used to be my favorite place, but now we will never return and we are currently looking for another Thai place to be our go-to."""
"2,""If you get nothing else here, get the tom kha soup. It is seriously the best I've ever had anywhere. I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. But this tom kha soup is the standard for which I compare all other tom kha soups. I've yet to find its match. It is truly delicious. I usually get the veggie variation (loaded up with silky smooth tofu and tons of veggies!) but any variation is just as wonderful. \n\nI just returned home from a trip to Thai Cuisine with some friends. The environment is comforting and warm. I love the lights strewn along the windows! They just add to the coziness of the place. After getting the obligatory veggie tom kha soup, I got the green curry with shrimp. Others in my party got the yellow curry and the panang curry and everyone was pleased with their choices. The green curry was a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies were nice and crisp.\n\nThey were featuring their mango and sticky rice dessert. I had a bite of my friend's and I was sad that I was too full to have a dessert of my own! \n\nAs we rolled out of our booth, totally stuffed and satisfied, we all proclaimed that this was the best decision we could have made with our night. Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in the city!"""

She showed me to the table which was marked reserved.  \n\nShe took drink orders then food orders.

"1,""I really don't understand the hype of this place. To be honest, had the personal recommendations from friends not made this place seem like the biggest deal in the city, then I would have probably rated it a 3 or 4. The pizza was just OK. It was decently greasy and the crust wasn't all that special. They wouldn't deliver (Even though I am literally a few blocks from them) and they don't accept credit / debit card - a huge downfall for me."""
"1,""I have tasted the best pizza in the US, Pepe's New Haven, CT and I have tasted a whole bunch of bad pizza and a whole bunch in the middle.  I am coming to the conclusion that pizza is a very personal thing to people who love it like I do.  After years of people telling me to go here, we finally stopped on our way home from my son's hockey game at noon on Saturday.  Service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do.  No one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order.  But after we figured it out everything was good.  We ordered a large pie, 1/2 cheese and 1/2 cheese and sausage.  The crust is very good and some of the best tasting I have had in some time.  It actually had a taste to it not just a bread taste.  After that, everything else is what I consider the personal taste part.  The sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me.  I don't know if they used provolone I should have asked but it gave the pizza a funny taste to me.  I won't be going back, just because my personal taste."""
"2,""THIS is an old-school pizza shop!  I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is PERFECT.  A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the old Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and definitely not the pepperoni you'll find at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, complete with the relic-style pizza box.  It's not in my neighborhood, and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!"""
"2,""My favorite pizza in the city. Hoagies are also pretty good but the pizza takes the spotlight. One of the best places to shoot pool in the south hills next door, what more do you need?"""
"1,""I stopped at Rohrich Toyota to look at their selection of used vehicles. I was quickly greeted by Paul - who was great! I test drove a Honda Element, which was clean and comfortable to drive, but the brakes on this one needed work - very slow response to stop. Then I looked at a Rav4. The first thing I noticed was dog hair on the interior surfaces. I'm surprised that seemingly simple things like brakes and cleanliness would not have been checked and fixed before putting the vehicles on the lot"
"1,""First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size.\n\nAlso, their prices were outrageous. Many of the items I liked I could have bought new for a little bit more. The upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store. We won't be back to this one."""
"2,""Stopped by last week.  Store was going to close for a couple of weeks for remodel and I think a cafe will be put in the front.  \n\nThe pita bread is made fresh daily as are many of the other prepared foods.  You can watch the pita being made thru the window in the bakery.  The pita is wonderful and you can pick up so many delicious Mediterranean food items to take home.  Olive oil, olives, cheeses, Hoummus Dip, Baba Ghannouj, deserts, Halva, Specialty Pita Pies.  \n\nGood food and friendly service."""
"1,""Currently sitting in the restaurant. Got seated very quickly, around 7:10pm. For the first time ever, the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fianc\u00e9 in it. We sat until 7:30 without so much as a \""""Hello\"""" from a nearby server. People were sat after us and have already received food. We finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed. She then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses. I've never received great service here, but it's never been this subpar either. This may be the last straw for this place. Three strikes and you're out, Mark-Pi.\n\nP.S. I ordered a Diet Coke, and received a glass of what seems to be Robitussin. That, or there's alcohol in this drink. Either case, I'm not thrilled."""
"1,""So just finished my meal with my family here and I will not go back! The waitress who I don't know her name because it was never shared was polite and efficient. The only redeeming quality I found in the meal was my 2 glasses of wine! Not that the food was bad it just wasn't good! I ordered Moo Shoo Pork with 4 \""""Chinese\"""" pancakes. Once it arrived I was looking forward to it as the main dish looked appetizing. Then I opened my \""""Chinese\"""" pancakes... OMG they served me steamed tortillas! I was expecting the crepe style Chinese pancakes and instead I had flour tortillas steamed!!! Growing up and just having moved to Pittsburgh from the West Coast I KNOW a tortilla when I'm served one and it wasn't even handmade freshly cooked tortillas that you get at a chain joint like Chevy's but pull em out of the bag from Giant Eagle tortilla! This not only killed the meal but when the $100.00+ tab came I was aghast! My wife and two kiddos had decent meals but just because you serve large portions doesn't mean you're serving 100 dollars worth of food! I felts cheated by high prices for mediocre chinese (notice the little C) food from a place that used to be rated as  great Chinese restaurant but that was back in 1996 as the plaques on the wall gleefully point out"
"2,""I ate here this past Saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.  We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to see a beautiful bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.\n\nThe main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.  The food was fantastic and not as expensive as I had expected while the service was good.  I would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into."""
"2,""This place has the best pizza I've ever had besides Keste and Paulie Gs in NYC.  Wood fired greatness.  Expect to wait on weekends in a crowded wine bar.  FANTASTIC red sauce and olive oil.  Not extensive on the wine list but good by the glass selection. A gem in Pittsburgh."""
"1,""Rating is based largely on the snottiness of the staff.  We weren't sure if children or non-locals were not appreciated.  We walked into a virtually empty restaurant at 6 on a Monday"
"1,""I'm not sure what the Mt.Lebo hype is about this place. The portions are small, the place is small, and the foods no more than average. I have been there twice now, thinking the first time might have been a fluke. We've heard so much about it that I have super high expectations. Their wine bar in the back is cute, but small. We couldn't even lift our elbows to sip our drink. While the waiters and service are good, the food is just not impressive. The pasta I got was good, but nothing to write home about. I got a pizza the second time I visited and it had a horrid taste. I don't know if it was the spinach or the cheese but something was VERY potent. They're pricy as well. The only thing I will give them credit for their Italian wedding soup. There's practically nothing in it, as they use think rice instead of noodles, but the broth and meatballs are to die for! Overall, not impressed. I probably won't return."""
"1,""Just way to expensive for what it is. It's good but not at the prices they choose. $9 for wedding soup? It was good, but not at that price and if I would've been told it was that much (was a special) I would've passed. Service was fine, but not attentive and slow, as well. Just so many other good Italian places in the area for half the price. Eggplant parm was enjoyable."""

"1,""I came here craving some sushi.  Looked up the best reviewed sushi place in my area and found this little restaurant.  I was excited at the front because it was a small restaurant and I love supporting small mom and pops.  \n\nI figured this may be a little diamond in the rough.  Man, was I wrong.  The sushi was not fresh.  The sushi wasn't rolled tight either.  The rice didn't have the trademark sushi rice flavor. \n\nSpoiled by the fresh ingredients and catches of California, I felt like the ingredients were sort of old.  Considering I went in on a Saturday, I figured it might be better but it wasn't at all.\n\nThe service was good.  That's the justification for the 2 stars.  Otherwise, I really wouldn't recommend this place to other people."""
"1,""Some good some bad.  This goes for the food and the service.  You MUST check your order if it's to go in any of the locations.  I have had more mistakes than correct orders in the last year or so.  \n\nThe \""""presses\"""" are MICROWAVES.  They are not training their employees to know this and they are not making it public.  I had an employee actually argue about it with me this morning because I wanted them to toast my bagel and assemble the egg and cheese without nuking it.  I got to my car and they had forgotten the cheese.  I went back and the cook told me that the counter person didn't know if I wanted it!  I think someone should have double checked if this was the case as the sandwich comes with cheese to begin with.\n\nEven Burger King doesn't microwave their breakfast!"""
"1,""This should say it all: we found a dress we loved, it was in our price range, but...we didn't return because of the customer service\n\nI suppose we could have gotten over it to get the dress, but we just didn't want that negative experience to taint our wedding. It was all going so well too. The people helping us were very down to earth, very accommodating and helpful, patient, and knowledgeable. But when we told them that we weren't ready to buy the dress, it was like Jekyll and Hyde and we were given attitude and a cold shoulder. We're talking passive-aggressive teenager-like behavior. Let me be clear - we didn't say no, we didn't say we were going to go somewhere else - all we said was that we weren't ready. In all likelihood we were going to be back in a couple weeks and buy, and just wanted to think about it one more time. It's a purchase that costs thousands of dollars"

Overall, haircut & style = 3 stars.\n\nTHE MANI\nThis mani brought down the average rating of my visit as I'd give it one star.  I haven't gotten a lot of manis--maybe a half dozen times for fancy events--but I know a bad one.  It was freaking dirty at the mani station where a different girl did my nails.  The towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it!  Seriously, get some bleach.  Then I figured out what the stains were...the girl made me bleed on two fingers while cutting my cuticles.  One bled quite a bit.  But she just pretended like it wasn't happening and continued to chatter on about Black Friday shopping and her plan to score big.  Had the mani station not been in the very back of the salon, I would have ran away when--this is true--she got up to use the restroom in the middle of mani.  Um, I usually do my own nails, but I'm guessing this isn't normal.  As if she were aiming for the worst mani ever, the polish wasn't even within the lines at all.  Then, she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said she's get the stylist.  Mani = 1 star.\n\nThe stylist didn't come back after a couple minutes.  When I asked the receptionist where the stylist was, she didn't know.  I just wanted to get out of there.  So I took off the smock and left with wet hair and nails.  I was pretty bummed since I had specifically scheduled the appointment on that particular afternoon because I had a big event that evening.\n\nI actually felt like a sucker tipping at more than 20% for these services.  But I had put the tips in the little envelopes before I got my nails done and I didn't want to wait for them to dry to decrease the tip.  So I tipped and left.\n\nSummary: Free isn't great when you have to go home and immediately wash your hair and remove the nail polish."""
"1,""Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).\n\nWe were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!\n\nThen, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  \n\nOh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! \n\nI've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!"""
"2,""First, Giant Eagle is convenient. It open early and closes late on a daily basis. I have yet to find another store that sells the same variation of food in a unitary complex. And despite its size, the supermarket is clean, and the employees are knowledgeable on the status and location of most items.\n\nSecond, the prices for non-produce items are competitive if not better than nearby competing stores. The produce items tend to be more expensive, but, to be fair, nearly all if it is fresh.\n\nThird, Giant Eagle offers a brand guarantee and a return policy which assure customer satisfaction"

"1,""I never really understood why Doc's was so popular.  I personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck.  Otherwise, the prices suck (beer served in 10 ounce cups on special for $2.50 - come on), the food is mediocre, and the atmosphere is nonexistent.  The drinks are weak as well.  \n\nIf you're looking for a night out, there are better places close by in Shadyside.  The deck really is nice, but it doesn't help the fact that the prices are terrible for drinks, especially for what you get.  That being said, I end up here a lot because others seem to like it...maybe I'm missing something."""

"1,""My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the \""""list\"""". We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of \""""out of towners\"""" who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before). \n\nWe subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night."""
"1,""Beware the loud-mouthed lout working the front. We stopped by a couple nights ago and asked to check the menu. Finding it acceptable -- despite an abundance of starch with minimal protein -- we walked away to go find the other members of our party to return and ask for a table. But we were accosted by a boorish old man who kept yelling \""""Hey!\"""" until we turned around to see what he wanted. Come to find out he wanted to insult us by telling us to check out the hamburgers across the street if we didn't want or couldn't afford his fare.\nWell, needless to say, we didn't go back and had a fine dinner elsewhere. Tip to the house: Insulting the public is no way to win friends or customers."""
"2,""Never had any experience with rudeness here, or any other problem. They make the best beans and greens around (and I order this dish at every Italian restaurant) - brothy, just the right amount of saltiness, and just right for sopping up whatever's left on the plate with their delicious crusty bread.  The salad with Gorgonzola is also pretty amazing.  A great neighborhood standby."""
"1,""I am a nice, amicable person. I treat others with kindness and have a highly positive attitude. I rarely complain about things. Thus, it makes me sad to write a negative review. However, the way in which Mozart Management Staff have behaved and conducted themselves over the past two years warrants this review. We moved to Pittsburgh when I was in graduate school. We loved our tiny, cute apartment at Schenley Arms, our first home as a couple. This abruptly changed when simple calls to request that they salt the driveway were met with aggression, irritability and statements such as \""""we have never had a complaint before\"""" and \""""we cannot accommodate your schedule\"""". I felt guilty at first about calling, but then had an epiphany and realized that Mozart has serious issues. The tone of their written  correspondence is also highly intimidating, demeaning and threatening. I will not bore you with the additional myriad of complaints that exist. What ever happened to customer service, decency and basic regard for other human beings?    \n       If you value your hard earned money and do not want to be met with criticism and hostility when interacting with your landlord..AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Also, there are a fair amount of negative reviews when you do a search on Google..READ AND BELIEVE THEM. They are completely mean and disrespectful. This is not the kind of business I want to support, as it conflicts with my value system. We are moving out ASAP when our lease expires. \n\nPS the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve 5 stars! I hope they aren't treated as bad as the tenants."""
"1,""They just broke into my house without any notice to show around. They knocked so violently I almost mistaked it for gunfire. Then, before I was able to say anything, they broke in. There was at most 2 seconds interval between the knock and the break in. I wasn't dressed, and the guy just said \""""Oh hi, we're showing the apartment\"""", and stormed into my kitchen. Ridiculous. I started ranting as soon as they left the room. This is totally invasive and disrespectful. I didn't read their lease very carefully when I moved in and I totally regret it (they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day, so I thought whatever, how bad could it be?). Apparently, breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here, and if you don't comply, they'll fine you as much as your unit's monthly rent (around $1000 for telling them no you can't enter the house). I've heard of several cases like this. They're unbelievably hostile and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible."""
"1,""Breakfast is always good. But too much Pamela's seems greasy. You can cook it all at home for much cheaper. However, the pricing really is low when you're lazy. The wait is ridicious at times. I would recommend the Shadyside location over the other two. It's more clean and better parking. Cash only."""
"2,""Woah. Thank goodness for yelp. That's how I learned about this breakfast gem. The boy just moved to PA so we went out foraging for breakfast, but before I did, I did a quick Yelp search. We headed to Pamela's as soon as I saw the reviews. \n\nThere were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down. Here's my only complaint. We waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down, but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line, which was a bit rude. \n\nThe seating is tight, but the atmosphere diner-esque. Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art (some for sale, no less). \n\nThe menu, while not particularly health-conscious, was heavy on eggs and pancakes. We went with the specialty pancakes, banana-walnut and choc. chip.  Both were delicious. I really wanted to and tried to finish mine, but I just couldn't man up. \n\nThe other complaint, which is of no-fault of the restaurant, was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene. Despite the deliciousness of the food, things got tense for a while. \n\nI think the next time I have a serious pankcake-hankering, I'll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela's."""
"1,""Two words: grossly overrated. If I am going to wait an hour for breakfast/brunch, it needs to not only be good, but also unique. Unfortunately, Pamela's is neither of these things. Then again, the hour-long wait does provide you will ample time to find a ATM because they only take cash. If you want to wait in line for an hour for food that is both good and unique, try Coca Cafe."""
"2,""I'm from California and hotcakes is something that's not common in our food vocabulary. We just settle on pancakes and call it a day.\n\nMy brother took me and my mother to Pamela's for brunch and it was pretty packed. Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes. They all looked very good, but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes (was craving strawberries). We finally got seated, ordered what we want, and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner. The food came out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes. They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness. The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries, as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar, that was like the cherry on top. It was pure harmony.\n\nDefinitely check it out when you're in Pittsburgh!"""
"1,""I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic, from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville, I have enjoyed it.  In light of that, China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of okay.\n\nThe positives: \n\nThe vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different.  The food isn't terrible, either, but it's not great.  It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there, I tried to go to Pamela's first, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh, and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.\n\nThe negatives:\n\nDim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It's not romantic, just dim.\n\nThe only waitress I've had there is pretty rude.  She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60, because she didn't do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.\n\nThe food is only okay.  \n\nAll in all, if you're on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace, try something else.  You won't HATE your experience here, but it won't be memorable, either.  I will probably return, though, for the cheap lunch specials, but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can, not because I really love the place."""
"2,""We order takeout here several times a month. The food is always very good, and quite plentiful for a take-out order. The quality seems pretty consistent as well. They even called me back once to double check something on the order. That was really nice. Delivery times are always good, and they're very fast on slow days. Meals in the restaurant or also high-quality. My wife and I have probably eaten here 40 times in the last five years."""
"2,""Had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years.  We shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps.  Both were delicious, and I'm freaking thrilled when a restaurant knows what a caramelized onion is supposed to look like!  My flatbread was smothered in them, just the way I like it.  The sashimi was nothing crazy, I liked the grilled pineapple with it.  \n\nMy husband got himself a burger, the barbecue one, to be exact, and I had the wild mushroom pasta.  I was concerned it would be too similar to the flatbread, but the server raved about it, so I tried it anyway.  \n\nMy husband enjoyed his burger, though he thought it could have been less salted.  He was happy that the temperature was correct, also.\n\n The salad that came with my entree was... Ok.  The blue cheese dressing was eh, the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda squishy, and I actually spit out a crouton.  It had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil.  I usually love croutons too.\n\nThe pasta was tasty, but almost too tasty, if that makes sense.  Too many competing flavors.  My husband was thrilled that they got \""""al dente\"""" right, when he had a bite.  I'd also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch, but there aren't a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat.\n\nOverall, I'd eat here again, and get the same apps and a lighter entree."""
"1,""This restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance. That is where the positive ends. The food is LOUSY. I paid $9 for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen (OK, it was thawed, but had previously been frozen) corn, about 4 tablespoons of black beans and the same amount of feta. As a vegetarian, this salad was one of two that had some sort of substance to make one think of a meal. What a disappointment - I won't be back."""
"1,""Everything about the pedi was ok except the polishing part.  12 hours later I had to wear shoes, and the polish smudged because it was slopped on so thick it never would have dried. \n\nAs she was polishing my nails, I was thinking, \""""Man, that is way too thick!  It'll never dry!\"""", but I didn't say anything because I thought maybe she had some super topcoat that would make the impossible possible.  Well, she didn't, and the polish stayed not just tacky, but downright WET for 4 hours, before I finally just SCRAPED the goop off and painted them myself.  \n\nI will never be back, and wish I had saved my $30 (I had a Groupon) and my $15 tip.  Should have just done them myself."""
"1,""Our wedding cake and dessert table vendor was included in our reception package so I'm sure the owners are going to say we didn't pay them directly so what I write doesn't matter (I've seen this response in other negative reviews).  In my opinion, that should not matter.  We should still receive the same type of respect, courtesy and professionalism that all clients *should* receive.  This was not the case.  I won't rewrite what I posted last year about our issues with the dessert table and the attitude of Linda, but what I am posting about now is our 1 year anniversary cake top.  We were given a certificate in our package for a free, fresh cake made in our *wedding cake flavors.*  Linda even wrote the flavors on the card.  I was really excited to taste the cake since my husband and I didn't really get a chance to during our reception.  They gave us a plain chocolate cake with white icing.  This is not what our wedding cake was.  When I called and asked if there was a mistake I was told someone would call me back.  Of course, they didn't.  So, I called again and spoke with Steve who LAUGHED at me when I asked why we didn't receive a cake in our wedding flavors and then had the audacity to say 'well, you got a free cake.'  Really?!  It wasn't good and it was a plain cake I could have made myself.  When I said 'that's not the point' he said 'what do you want me to do?!  Another cake, fine.  When do you want to pick it up?'  When we picked up the second cake, again, in was the SAME cake as before.  I have yet to try my own wedding cake flavor.  They are so rude, cocky and ignorant.  I will *never* go to the bakery again nor will I ever recommend it to anyone else."""
"1,""There were six employees behind the counter and one customer waiting for their sandwich to be made, and I was the only person in line and couldn't get a single person to take my order.  Walked out and got faster service at Panera, which had a line out the door.\n\nOh well."""
"1,""Please don't go here. I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .\n\nI think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.\n\nThe service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my food off. No \""""how's it going\"""", no water refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink. \n\nThe portions are extremely small - I've never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.\n\nThe waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?\n\nOther reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.\n\nJews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're \""""busy\"""", can you imagine what it'll be like on Christmas?\n\nThe slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurant?\n\nOnly go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist."""

However, it appeared to me that the money would have been better spent on updating the rooms themselves. Apparently it used to be a Marriott some time ago - I'm guessing they decided to drop the brand rather than update to Marriott's standards.\n\nThe continental breakfast was a crime. $12 for buffet style eggs (from a bag no less), sausage, french toast, and oily potato cubes they were trying to say were home fries is unconscionable. Passing on this gastronomic atrocity, I decided to invest my money in an english muffin and two 4 oz. yogurts (only option is Strawberry Banana?

"1,""The entrance is hard to find/identify... the exit says Sears, but the entrance has a door that says Avis/Budget.  You have to wait in line to bring your car in for service instead of parking in the lot and going into the shop with your keys.  Waiting in line took roughly 20 minutes on a Tuesday about 12 noon.  \n\nI brought my car in for a simple oil change.. it took almost 3 hours.  Granted when they told me it was done, there were several things that Diego had found that I could fix in my car.. the list of repairs totaled over $800.  I didn't bring the car in for an inspection, just an oil change.. that's all I wanted.. could have saved time elsewhere.  It was about $40 for a high mileage oil change including tax and with a discount coupon.\n\nThey assured me that the fluids (windshield washer, power steering, etc.) would be topped off"
"2,""My wife and I came in last week to get ourselves a new mattress.  Our salesman, Antwan, was interested in helping us get the right bed, not the most expensive one.

"1,""Food was ok. It wasn't bad, just nothing great. Its like the place tries too hard. They walk you in through the kitchen (cute, but gimmicky). The place is overfilled with photos and artwork. They are nice photos, but its distracting almost on purpose. As if the food is not the real star of the show. It shows in the flavors. The service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu. My server lost me towards the end. He was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him. All in all, it was ok. More focus on food and flavors and less on cliche. Its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal. Nothing to remember"""

The person who answered the phone, Tasha, didn't say anything about them being behind. Had she said so, I would have waited 45 minutes before going there. Turns out I sat there for almost 3 hours!

"1,""On Yelp, a 500th review is a milestone.  It's a big deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews, it's a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  Fairpoint Communications is such a business.  Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver.  In a nutshell, it has been a disaster.\n\nFairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up.  They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth.  One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service.  When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly.  The billing was never correct.  The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day.  Calls about all of these issues rarely went well.  People were apologetic but problems remained.  Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers.  Two different people in my office were reduced to tears.  Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles..\n\nMy company switched carriers recently.  Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.\n\nTo Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.\n\nTo New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.\n\nI don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.  I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with."""
"1,""Friendly staff and all but the bathroom was rundown and the wife lifted the slip around the mattress and the mattress was streaked, skanky and old.\n\nI had two girls with me and so we needed extra towels but the housekeeper in the hall told me \""""I need a towel from you to give you a towel but anyway we don't have any extra so I can't help you.\"""" So I walked down to the fitness center and grabbed two towels and the housekeeper looked at me and I looked back at her and i just squeezed by lol.\n\nFunny another reviewer mentioned a flying beetle in the room, we had one of those, too! I got rid of it myself, though lol.\n\nAlso, they have the bistro setup, I just don't like those at all. To get coffee, you have to buy it from the 'bistro' instead of the free coffee setup Courtyard used to have. \n\nFor those of us that are Marriott-loyal, I think the Fairfield Inns are better value. They are just as comfortable, the beds and pillows are just as good- which is really all we care about- breakfast is free, and they tend to be newer."""

I think the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager, after saying that we would be hving a 6 course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in providing an enjoyable experiance.\n After ordering our first drinks and finishing it, a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another drink"
"2,""I love Al Mike's. The restaurant is hidden in the beautiful First Ward neighborhood. They've got great food, a good beer list and a very chill atmosphere. I typically get the blue cheese burger, while my boyfriend loves to get the London broil sandwich or the pita chicken wrap with honey mustard. The fries and onion rings are delicious too. Plus, it's non-smoking, which I LOVE. I just wish it stayed open later."""
"2,""This was bar food heaven. Looks like a regular neighborhood bar on the outside and inside. We stopped by around 9 and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table. The places looks like it only fits about 75 people max. \n\nWaiting for a table we sat at the bar and I noticed they had a great beer selection on tap and I'm not talking Anhueser Busch B.S. Lots of craft beers and a good amount of local brews. I tried a few high ABV brews that were really good and put my head in another world. I had been in town for about 3 hours by this time I'm really liking Charlotte. For dinner I tried something called \""""What It Is\"""". it's a Cajun pasta dish. Being Cajun, I was hesitant to try cajun food so far away from the deep south but they came though. I considered licking the plate. I was actually sopping up the sauce with bread like I usually only do at home. I was thoroughly impressed."""
"2,""In 79 reviews, no one has given this place below 3 stars.  That should tell you all you need to know.  Consistently good bar food in a quiet, pub-like environment. Service is always consistent, too.  Nothing fancy - but that's perfect for me.  Go for the London Broil sammy at lunch.  Reasonably priced and delicious.\n\nIf I had a magic wand and could change a few things about this restaurant, I'd focus on parking and adding more tables.  Street parking in a quiet neighborhood can be limited.  I've been here a handful of times when there has been a line out the door with people waiting for a table.  Both faults, however, are incredibly hard to control."""
"2,""Run to Alexander Michael's this Christmas season for dinner or drinks.  You will thank me.   \n\nTucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A little bit magical.  \n\nI was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  Great beer selection.  We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not so much), my hubs said the burger was good, fried pickles (yum!), veggie pita was great, but you have to get the \""""what it is.\""""  What it is sustained me for years.  I'm veggie now, so no chicken for me... but, it was good all those nights!\n\nWhile the food is not 5-star worthy, the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure."""

"1,""I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago, this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!\n\nParking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.  \n\nThe food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the \""""crab\"""" soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.\n\nI will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon."""
"2,""From the outside you see a quiet street with some couples strolling along hand-in-hand.  As you get closer to the front door you hear a bit of a buzz.  Is that a bar?

"2,""Might not be the easiest location to visit or see, but it's a good option because of the people that work here.  Tucked away across a parking lot and underneath an overhand is this Showmars location, but there are a lot of regulars that frequent this place.  The servers and folks running the register are super nice and they recognize you, call you by name, and ask how your work day is going.\n\nI take my lunch around 1pm so WAY after the lunch rush, but I can imagine this place being super busy.  There are a lot of tables and booths to sit at and the food comes out fast - with daily specials.\n\nSuper affordable and predictable, you can have you food in front of you pretty quickly - especially if you are trying to do a quick lunch.\n\nNow, this place is pretty practical if you work Uptown and can walk here for lunch.  Probably not a place to drive to since you would have to pay for parking somewhere... even if you park on the street at a metered spot."""

Maybe. For those who are not up to speed on a traditional Chicago dog, it consists of: an all beef frank, onions, uber green relish, yellow mustard, sport peppers, tomato and a pickle spear hugged into a poppy seed bun. Matt's definitely delivers on these components. The dog was a bit snappy, like I enjoy, and all the condiments were fresh and tasty. \n\nThe Hot Dog Meal Deal (#1) came with the loaded Chicago dog, a drink and your choice of fries or chips for $6.22. I went with the fries and I have to say, I was a little bit disappointed...they were a little smushy. You can also read Tonya's most recent review on her description of the fries. Regardless though, I enjoyed my hot dog so much that I will overlook the limp fries. \n\nI definitely want to come back and try a few other menu items...I see a cheesy beef in my future."""

On the other hand they have pretty solid lunch specials, great wings (the Hot BBQ are delicious), and some nice beer specials ($2.50 drafts on Thursday ($2 domestics), Yes Please!) They also have plenty of TVs and a pretty good customer rewards program and when it comes to a sports bar, what more do you really need."""

I personally was not thinking to take pictures of all the screw ups due to all of the complaints the whole table was making. I hated to make so many complaints but I've never experienced such horrible service. It was awful We couldn't find any positive in it. As a matter of fact the waitress didn't even come back to pick up all the checks. It Was 7 of us and 6 ppl got their checks. We told the management We needed to pay another check and that We didn't know why the waitress would leave one out, his response was unprofessional.  :("""

I ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes - cottage pie. What I was served was: sparse ground beef, frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really don't think corn is typically used in cottage pie...

This place is quaint and just kind of tucked back in the corner of the Arboretum. We started off lunch with a crunchy California roll as we really didn't know what to get first with the huge menu selection they offer. The sushi was phenomenal with just the right amount of everything. But not really being in a sushi mood we didn't give any of their amazing sushi a try, yet. We both decided on the hibachi chicken which came with so much food it was hard to eat it all. And the price was so low it was perfect. The vegetables and meat were cooked great and the taste was just right. My wife is extremely picky about vegetables and she ate them all.

"2,""While I am not much on chain restaurants, Rock Bottom is certainly a place we will be visting again.  \n\nMy boyfriend and dining partner in crime is a huge beer lover.

The spirit and wine offerings were also pretty good with a solid variety of wines and the usual spirits (with some fun cocktail options).\n\nThe menu is huge and offers enough to please anyone.  Our server was extremely sweet, quick, and very knowledgeable of the menu.  She passed the test when she offered solid beer recommendations with food pairings.  The food was surprisingly good.  We tried the southwest eggrolls to start (holy carbs and cheese) and then split a salad with flat bread pizza.  Once we finished dinner we moved to the bar...which I made a note on to visit for game days.  Spectacular set up with plenty of seating.  \n\nThe gem of this place is actually the bartenders.  I'm sure that it's no surprise that if one sits at a bar, they are most likely going to chat with the bartenders.

When our drinks did arrive, the server ran off before taking our dinner order, more time passes... we order and our food comes out pretty reasonably ~15-20 minutes.  When the food did come out three orders were missing completely, our server did not bring our food and was nowhere to be found, we sat waiting until finally she came by.  At this point we've been here well over an hour.  The manager comes by, gets the food out, says that there would be a free round of drinks for the whole table.  I didn't receive the drink promised by the manager and when I asked the server I got a look, this was the first and only time I asked her about anything!?  She brought the drink as I was returning from the restroom and said that an entire bottle of wine would be brought out due to the issues, we explained that we had other commitments that it wasn't necessary.  Then the manager threw in two bottles of champagne, at this point, I'm pretty sure he knew that nobody had a great experience and was trying to save face.  \n\nIn the end, the manager was great at covering up for the lack of service we received but with so many options in downtown Charlotte I would chose another place next time."""
"1,""After two recent visits here, I can honestly say I am torn on my review, but overall I know I have had better. Most recently, we arrived shortly after 12 and were seated indoors, because the patio was full, and it took our server over 15 minutes to take our drink order. We started off with the spinach artichoke dip and chips, which arrived 5 minutes before our food. Before I get to the food, the appetizer was cold and came with about 10 chips. Being there were four of us we asked for some extra chips and some salsa. The chips were warm, however the salsa, stay away, unless you like Pace's from the grocery store. Really, are they kidding serving store bought salsa???\nOn to the food.  We ordered a good variety, stuffed peppers, chicken enchiladas, burger and chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn! The enchiladas and peppers were so spicy we had to ask for more water.

"2,""I recently attended a wedding at the Charlotte City Club and it was gorgeous! Not only is it a beautiful venue with a fabulous view, but the meal was high-quality (hands down the best macaroni and cheese on the planet). It was definitely one of the best dinners I've had at a wedding. They also did a great job of ushering everyone to the reception and the service was excellent.\n\nReason for 4 stars?  I wondered if the bride and groom were paying based on consumption because the drinks were incredibly stiff-overly so. I had to ask them to water mine down more than a few times.  Also, the top floor can accommodate several people but there are a few rooms rather than one large one so we missed out on the cake cutting because we were in the room with the band. For that reason I would prefer a location with one large space for a wedding reception, but over-all it was a very beautiful space."""

We each started with a martini as they are all $4 dollars on Thursdays (normally $7-9).  The waters didn't actually come until after the martinis which is a little backwards, but the martinis were welcomed with open arms - and were yummy!  The food came out quickly and hot... I ordered the pasta primavera with creamy pesto and added shrimp.  It was nicely flavored, it was chalk full of goodies and the portion was more than enough.  I was disappointed that I didn't have a fridge in my hotel to take home the leftovers!  My friend ordered the grits.  Definitely a good dish but I would not recommend it to those who don't like spicy food because it had quite a cajun kick.\n\nAll in all a good experience.  Check it out!"""
"1,""Great service, but this is honestly the worst food I have ever eaten out at a restaurant in my life. I dont suggest going here for food EVER (maybe for the drink specials and hookah but nothing else)."""
"1,""Summary:  Beautiful hotel, highly error-prone staff. \n\nIt is rare to find a hotel as beautiful as this. The look is very modern which I happen to love. It has a decent gym, which is also rare for a hotel. There is a very soothing bar area with live, gentle jazz music.  The staff are very professional in demeanor and friendly.  This COULD be an awesome place to stay. \n\nI experienced the following over two stays:\n\nI arrive 11pm, exhausted from travel, only to be told that the hotel is full.  The only room they have left to offer me is half a \""""parlor\"""" room. I was given a SOFA BED to sleep on. I had made the reservation several weeks prior, with guaranteed late arrival. \n\nI get to the room and the electronic key does not work. I call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall 20 minutes half asleep for a guard to show up. His key does not work either.  \n\nOk, this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels, right?  \n\nI gave a shirt and slacks to laundry. That evening I receive someone else's underwear instead of my own clothes. \n\nI gave a pair of jeans to dry clean, specifying not to wash because they would shrink. Well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size.\n\nA pattern develops.\n\nOn the third night, around 11pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door. He claims to be security but show no identification.  He wants to see my id.  Highly suspicious, I don't open the door and I slip my gym copy of my license under the door. Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error.  What were they were thinking?\n\nA waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a 20 minute period. The bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time. \n\nA gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen. \n\nThe \""""weather report\"""" button on the phone gives you a recording describing YESTERDAY's weather.\n\nEtcetera.\n\nBottom Line:  Stay here for the serenity and beauty of the decor, but you will need the patience of a saint!"""
"2,""Like most other Westins, the decor is very nice, and rooms are spacious and full of amenities. The bar and the restaurant is pretty good. Location is in  downtown, but certainly on the edge of town.\n\nDeducting one star since they don't have a platinum/concierge lounge."""
"2,""I had a tremendously positive experience at this Westin (the 12th-ish or so I've stayed at this year).  \n\n- Beautiful, very new-seeming property\n- Great location pretty close to anything you'll need\n- Reasonable prices on self-parking\n- Excellent service\n- Extremely clean, well-kept and comfy space (I was on the 22nd floor...so I suppose I can only speak for it)\n- Upgraded to a corner suite that was amazing---very well appointed, functional and comfortable\n\nAgain, this is my 12th or so Westin stay this year---and it has been the best of all of those."""
"1,""There are much better choices in uptown Charlotte!  Let me start with the good...the front desk staff. The three people who assisted me at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. Great customer service!\n\nNow the bad...stains. There is no other way to describe everything in my room. Multiple stains on the carpeting and the comforter. The bathrobe hanging on the back of the bathroom door had a huge brown stain on the sleeve that I kept telling myself was makeup from the last occupant. Every, yes every, bath towel had a stain (either black or yellow). There was stained grout behind the toilet like it had leaked sometime in the past. Even the shower curtain was stained. Then there was the hair dryer. It was sooooo sticky that I didn't even want to touch it. It appeared to be covered in about 15 years worth of cheap hairspray. \n\nI can appreciate that the hotel is getting older and may need a renovation soon, but come on people!  How about you splurge and replace your bath towels and hair dryers now!  \n\nLet me be clear that I think the cleaning staff is doing the best they can with what they have been given. They just need a better starting product!"""
"1,""I've stayed here for four years in a row and this go around have noticed a serious decline in service and quality.  There was only one employee available to check people in and after a full day I waited 30 minutes to check in.  As a result, I didn't have time to go up to the room before leaving for dinner.  They said that my bags would be delivered to my room but when I got back at 10:30 p.m., ready to collapse, they were no where to be found.\n\nThere was standing water in the tub and the shower head was only partially working.  Not the kind of experience I expect from a hotel where there are additional fees for everything - I'm talking $15 for one day of parking!  \n\nI have high standards for this place since my previous stays have been great.  Why are you slacking Westin Charlotte?"""
"1,""Quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life. noisy, dirty, poorly renovated and the WORST customer service known to man. The way I was treated by the front desk was enough reason to never step foot within a mile radias of this place. Doesn't even deserve one star in my book. \n\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS!"""
"1,""I totally agree with you that Time Warner Cable has one of the worst customer service I have come across.  Sorry for the comment.  They may be the only service provider in this area that they do not care or the employees have not been paid enough that they do not care about their job.\n\nI signed up as they knocked at my door.  Like someone said, we need internet nowadays.  We need cable TV in order we can get national or world news, more informatory program or some quality programs.  They were fast to install for you.  But when you do not have service, it takes forever to talk to someone on the phone or they hanged you up after waiting forever.\n\nHowever when I wanted to seek their help, they would not answer you without a pin and kept transfer you to so many departments (really that big, I don't know) till your phone call dropped.  That will take you hours on the phone without a solution.\n\nAs I need to move and cancel the account, they will give you a hard time.  Watch out this company."""
"1,""Time Warner Cable is an incompetent company that runs a monopoly on internet services in certain neighborhoods.  They will enroll you in bill pay, then charge you late fees when their service fails to draw funds.  Not failure to draw funds from a lack of cash in the account.  No, this is a failure to draw funds because their billing department is complete and utter garbage.  Their services are sub par and they over charge for this shit service because as previously stated they run the only line available for entire neighborhoods and small towns through out the Charlotte area."""
"1,""After taking three afternoons off work to wait for technicians that never showed up, my internet was finally installed, at which point I was informed that even though I ordered wireless, wireless isn't available unless you pay an extra $11 monthly fee for the router. The technician (a very nice guy) advised me to purchase my own router, which I did. When I called Time Warner to register the IP, I was informed that there is a separate $7 a month fee to use your own router.  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE COMPANY. I hope all the CEOs get halitosis and their wives leave them for John Mayer."""
"1,""It is the first time I gave 1-rated review, while I normally gave 4-5 stars regardless of service quality. The worst service came from TWC. Took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done. All they did is to transfer the phone call to another representative after telling me \""""I can't do this, I can't do that\"""". Worst service ever!"""
"1,""Ok so I finally dined here and lets say disappointing wasn't even the word...if I'm going to be dropping a large sum of money down I want it to be on food that I actually enjoyed!\n\n I went a few weeks ago and we opted for the three course Chef's Tasting menu...well lets just say if these dishes were a reflection of any chef well they truly shouldn't be one right down to the presentations!!\n\n For my first course i had the \""""Baked Beans\"""" as we called it not at all what I expected to get and  barely any Duck Confit in it as it said on the menu very boring and missing lots of flavors so yes they tasted and looked like Baked Beans. Then second course I had the Tomato with goat cheese and peas I had one bite and did not go back for another. The plate was filled with tomato liquid and the goat cheese was running right in it  YUCK is all I have to say!! Then finally our last course MY favorite is Rack of Lamb so of course I'm now anticipating my Lamb I had asked for it to be cooked Rare/Medium Rare just in case they were to over cook it. WELL sure enough it came out Medium Well...Now i would have sent it back but my friend had ordered his steak Medium Well and got his Rare so i didnt want to be that table that sent everything back....\n\nOnly good thing about this place was my company. it is outdated they may want to rethink they're concept AGAIN and possibly add a few woman servers in there to bring some life to this place!! Finally this place was stale like the bread!!"""
"2,""Taking in a Surprise \n\nTaking a light outdoor walk from Camden Southend to the streets of uptown Charlotte sure makes one hungry. The first place that caught my eye was a resilient green light coming off South Tryon. It was so bright it was reflecting off the mirror statue at the Betchlor Museum across the street. The next thing I know I am staring the menu at the best table in the house. (If you have ever walked past this place you know what table it is.) The light music and privacy of the booth makes for intimate conversation and romantic situations. The comfortable and spacious booth allows you to play footsy all night without hurting yourself. \n\nI had the mussels which were Euphoric. Cooked in some type of wine, butter, and cream which happen to be DAMN good when mixed together. My palate was very pleased and upset at the same time. Pleased with the sauce from the mussels running down my face, but upset when the last empty shell fell with the others. Happily in a coma after being satisfied by a taste I could only once wonder about I got myself the check. I didn't care how much it was, it was good, the service was astounding, and I was so comfortable at this point I could not even set a price on this kind of experience. Popped it open and to my surprise I walked out of there paying less than $100 for two people+Wines +Appitizers+Desserts. \n\nAfter stumbling to the door trying to shake off my coma I gave one glance back at the place of magic and thought to myself I'll be back here before I know it to take on a new adventure for my taste buds."""
"2,""I've gotten massages from Modern Salon several times, and loved them all there... until the last time, when I lost my penchant- after learning the masseuse I had used before, no longer worked there. His replacement was a woman who did nothing but make me more tensed up than when I came in! It wasn't until after I already paid for the service, gave her a tip and went home, that I started thinking in retrospect... then got mad that I actually paid for something that made me feel WORSE. It was some time ago, so I will have to call them to see if her name's on record, so I can recommend not using her. I don't think she listened to a word I said. I had the 1-hour massage, and I explained to her before hand, that I wanted her to mainly focus on my upper back & neck, because I had a lot of pain in the area from working on the computer 24/7 until finishing a job that week. I also told her I prefer harder pressure. I have never had a \""""massage\"""" like that before. She did nothing but tickle me. I told her at least twice that she can use more pressure, but I guess she didn't care... then she ends up paying the LEAST amount of attention to my problem areas I asked her to focus on. I guess I was being too nice? I should have asked for someone else, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings. \n\nI haven't had a massage there since then, but I love getting my haircuts there. I've had a few different stylists, but loved each one. They were especially helpful when I had to undergo chemotherapy treatments, which made me lose all of my hair. When it finally started growing back in, it was a mess... they helped my hair to look & feel so much better and healthier. \n\nThe staff are all friendly and pleasant. The spa (upstairs) is nice and separated from the more chaotic salon and registers. The spa's waiting area is comfy and quiet, and the dressing rooms/showers/sauna room is nice, and offers a nice assortment of Aveda products to test out."""
"1,""I'm maybe I'm missing something here because I found the place to be really underwhelming. The service was excellent friendly and fast but the food was . . . eh. I kept getting a 'chemical taste' off of the food and I'm not normally someone who is sensitive to that kind of thing, I got the brisket tacos and they ended up being 1) kind of chemical artificial tasting and 2) watery from the salsa. Not really a good combination. Maybe I chose poorly but I wasn't impressed at all."""
"2,""I've been to this place over 100 times over the years of working uptown and just checked in for the first time. The staff here is great and friendly, the service is quick and its not very pricey. I love the chips and salsa and Mexican pizza and come quiet often for the breakfast."""
"2,""Knowing my love for Salsarita's on Rea Road, a coworker and I decided to head there for lunch. We arrived shortly after 12 and, like others have mentioned, the line was out the entryway.  However, even though the line was long it moves smoothly and didn't take too long.  Salsarita's has a rhytmn that seems to work, like an assembly line. I ordered the two taco combo with chips and queso, and a side of salsa.  I chose two soft tacos, which are steamed and topped with a meat, of which I chose chicken and pulled pork. Onto the toppings, lettuce, jalepeno, sour cream, guacamole and cheese to complete my order.  The chicken, just like the other location was great and the pulled pork was awesome, I wil definitely try that again.  The chips were fresh, some with a little extra seasoning that I love.  The queso was a little cold, but overall good.  A definite great spot for lunch, but may need to think about getting there a few minutes before 12, just to get ahead the large crowd."""
"1,""A few of us went here for lunch on a Friday and while the food was very good the service was very slow and inattentive.   \n\nI had the Blue Petit Mignon and the portion size was just right for lunch."""
"2,""I have been to the Actor's Theatre for several productions now, and I always forget to review them.  From Chaps to the Evil Dead to Rocky Horror, some are packed, some are, well, less than packed, but they never disappoint.\n\nIf you should happen by on opening night, they typically have an extra special event where you get some tasty goodies from the sponsor (seems like it is usually the same one, but it may change from show to show) as well.\n\nThey also have a cult movie night on (all? many? some?) Mondays with free admission and popcorn, so be sure and check that out if you are looking for something to do.\n\nLike most places, they have a nice little bar, and drink prices are not too bad, but it would be nice if they would give you the whole beer instead of pouring 2/3 of it or so into a cup.  I do not know if they keep the extra little bit for themselves or the next guy in line, but it is just one of those things that can be a little annoying, you know?"""
"1,""My instinct always told me that I should skip this place. Should have listened. It was just gross"
"2,""Mert's has my favorite collard greens and corn bread in Charlotte.  The salmon cakes are delicious as are the pork chops.  Fried chicken is above average, although not as delicious as the previous two entrees mentioned."""
"2,""Cornbread!! So yummy.  We took our friend visiting here for some \""""soul food\"""" and Mert's did not disappoint.  Come with an appetite!"""
"2,""Wow. This place is excellent!\n\nI grew up in Charlotte and sadly, never discovered this place until after I moved away. I heard a couple of great recommendations, and my family decided to try it out. \n\nThe meal starts out with some outstanding cornbread, so buttery it seems light and almost melts in your mouth. We also got a fried green tomato appetizer, which was really good. Between the four of us we had 2 orders of salmon cakes (delish), fried chicken, and ribs, and probably one of each of the sides. I would definitely recommend the salmon cakes again, fried chicken and ribs are a bit heavy for me but my dad and brother went to town. Everything was really good and made me lament living so far away from good southern cookin'.\n\nThen there was dessert. While my mom, brother and I were unbuttoning the top button of our pants and trying to make a little bit more room, my dad was going strong. We ended up with a slice of sweet potato cake (divine!) and a slice of coconut cake to take home for later. The waitress told us that all of the cakes are made by a woman in her home, and we could just imagine what her house must smell like... \n\nOur server was super friendly and comfortable"
"2,""Cool restaurant - I went here on a Monday afternoon with the wife, dad, and grandpa, while paying a little visit to Charlotte.  My dad and grandpa live in Charlotte and told us we had to try Mert's.  Cornbread was excellent - we all got our own little loaf as a starter.  Entrees come with two sides and I got the pulled pork as the main dish and okra and green beans.  The pulled pork was a little stringy and very vinegary, but unique.  \n\nWife got the salmon cakes and I didn't really care for them.  I told her she shouldn't have ordered that, but oh well.  Her mac and cheese was great though.  My grandpa ordered the fried chicken and it looked great and he really enjoyed it.  I tried a few bites and it was very moist and crispy.  I don't remember what my dad ordered...\n\nI like how they have tons of cool side dishes here and they're all soul food-type items.  We have tons of good restaurants in Southern California, but nothing like Mert's.  If I came back, I'd probably order the fried chicken, or the catfish if I'm feeling exotic.  They probably have about 20 or so sides - a good mixture of carbs and veggies - I wish I tried the fried green tomatoes...  Well I'll be back someday to try something different.  I'm glad my dad and grandpa took us here!"""
"1,""I really wanted to get grub at Price's, but they don't have a dining area and I didn't want to get take out.\n\nCame here for lunch.  Waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved.  Free cornbread was average.   I had the fried chicken and sides of mashed potatoes and mac n' cheese.  Surprisingly, none of it was really that good.  Service was cheerful though.\n\nI guess the best part was I was able to park in downtown Charlotte, found a free spot, and wasn't towed when I was done eating here."""
"2,""Not a lot to say other than great southern comfort food. Good fried chicken, great beef ribs. Small servings of ribs, but great flavor. Loved the collard greens and coconut cake. I'd go back. Definately worth trying."""
"2,""Was in Charlotte for two days and Merts Heart & Soul was recommended by everyone. Good food great location and I was impressed by the price. I went for Dinner Saturday then brunch on Sunday. I recommend it to"""
"2,""Mert's is true southern soul food.  Not the New American type, but the real stuff.  Mac-n-cheese, green beans cooked in animal fat, salmon cakes, fried chicken.  It's all good.  I love the mac-n-cheese and will often just order a veggie plate where I can pick 4 different ones to eat.  They always have vegetable specials so I can try something new every time I go.  \n\nThey also had 4 different hot sauces on the table.  I made a point to sample them all on the delicious corn bread they make."""
"1,""The worst customer service by server and manager. We've been coming here for years. Tonight's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Supposedly there was a computer error with our food. Fine, I understand it happens sometimes. However while waiting two hours, we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner. We got the same response every time. \""""It'll be right up.\"""" He did not\nconsider actually checking on the food. All the tables around us came, ate and left. Meanwhile, our server could not even remember to bring water to the table without being asked multiple times. \n\nAfter I stopped asking nicely about our food, the server finally went to inquire. The manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave. How generous. Otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers. She did not even follow through on that promise. We were given one free beer each. Pathetic. Over 80% of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention. People who make it a point to dine here every time we come. \n\nThe server never apologized. Nor did he bother to even clear our plates.\n\nThere are plenty of other places to spend your money where it will be appreciated."""
"1,""Such amazing soul food! Seriously some of the best collard greens ever! It's a shame that such awesome food can be disappointed by such horrible service! We waited for over an hour for an omelette and a vegetable plate! The waitress could have cared less that we had to wait. Our drinks stayed empty for most of the meal and it took 20 minutes and repeated requests for a small packet of mustard! We are from out of town and had heard such amazing things about this place! Once again, great food but super horrible service! Not sure, due to the service, that we will return the next time we are in Charlotte!"""
"2,""****** 4.5 stars *****\n\nOne of the few places where I can safely say that anything you order from the menu will be sure to please. Mimosa is one of downtown Charlotte's original \""""great\"""" restaurants, there long before all the big chain steakhouses decided to take up residence. This place is as safe as it gets, and doesn't break the bank doing it. The decor is very fashionable, and presents a really nice atmosphere without feeling too white tablecloth-like.\n\nI really like the \""""upscale Southern\"""" idea, and not many places in the country can pull it off as well or as consistently as Mimosa does. They specialize in local produce and meats, doing a great job of supporting all the great foods natural to NC. Any time one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant is a beefsteak salad you know they focus on all the details, because it takes a LOT more than you would think to make a REALLY good salad.\n\nWhether you're a Charlotte native, or just visiting the city for business, Mimosa should definitely be on your list of places to try if you want a real taste of Charlotte. It may be easy to go with the big chains like Mortons, Capital Grill, and Ruth's Chris, but your money will be much better spent and go a lot further here!"""
"2,""Mimosa is fantastic. I went there for lunch recently for my friend's birthday. I had the best cheeseburger I've ever had in my life. It was topped with bacon and cheddar cheese, but the burger itself was just seasoned perfectly. Mm mm. It is on the pricey side, but it's definitely more reasonably priced for lunch, so I'd recommend checking it out then. As other Yelpers have said, it's just one of those restaurants where everything you order is likely to be good."""
"2,""I enjoyed a 3 course brunch at Mimosa. We had a good discussion with our waiter about the area and the meal. Nice ambiance and food was top notch. I look forward to trying lunch/dinner in the future."""
"1,""We had a disappointing experience with customer service regarding a group reservation. In fact, they have yet to call back to confirm or cancel. If they can't get a reservation right, what else would have gone wrong?"""
"1,""First and last to this club. Very pricy,poor service and no contact dance. ... Other clubs in charlotte are better ... Very disappointed ....."""
"2,""You've gotta get the fried fish sandwich! While down here for a conference, my coworker who was local convinced me I had to try the fish sandwich...and get one to take on the plane too. While the crinkle cut fries are uber tasty, they're not the most amazing thing I've ever had. The mac and cheese was a good call (more on the gooey side) and the fish, while messy, was simply astounding. All for approx $10 too. plus they're a local Charlotte family chain, which I absolutely adore. Service was prompt. The only thing is that they close at 3pm. \n\nIf I ever get to come back to Charlotte, I'll pick up some Showmars!"""
"2,""Ok, so I was in a pasta type of mood and decided to try Luce to see if all the hype was legit..........and I'll just say that Luce has been added to my Italiano list:-)  I had the express lunch which includes bread, soup or salad, an entree and a drink for $13 guaranteed in 30 minutes or less.  The soup of the day was lobster bisque, which was super yummy with the bread and my entree was the buttera(tubular pasta, italian sausage, sweet peas and tomato-cream sauce).....double yummy!  Hand clap for Luce, I may just have to check out their sister restaurants too!"""
"2,""Since I have promised myself that I'm not allowed to move away from Charlotte until I have eaten at every restaurant, I figured that Restaurant Week would be a perfect time to visit Luce, a small Uptown spot that has been on my list for years.  Upon arrival, our table wasn't quiet ready.  No problem there, because the suggestion to \""""grab a drink at the bar\"""" was a given.  Tucked away in the corner, the attentive bar-goddess quickly poured us wine and presented us with nibbles.  Super-crunchy potato chips (which appeared to be made in house), as well as a heaping handful of olives were placed in front of us.  \n\nThese. Olives.  \n\nI wanted to fall asleep in a bowl if these olives.  I don't know what kind of magic the cooks/aka/olive-wizards behind the scenes of the closed kitchen put into them (fresh garlic? fresh rosemary? tears of their first born?), but I'm talking LIFE CHANGING. Like little baby angels.  \n\nThe food was great, service attentive and friendly.\nI'll definitely be back....for the olives."""
"1,""Not impressed!!  If there were 0 stars that's the rating this place would get.  I ordered a cheeseburger and it was worse than what you'd expect from a school lunchroom!

Sorry, Hartigan's, I won't be going back!"""
"1,""What the hell, Phil's Tavern? Every time I come here (usually before a show), things just don't work out. I wanted them to, but they just didn't.\n\nFOOD: The only food I've tried here were the jalapano poppers, and then I never tried anything here again. How do you burn something in a deep fryer? Normally I'd just be impressed, but I was hungry. \n\nDRINKS: Their drink specials are nothing to write home about. The dirty martini was weak, and the tiny, shrivelled, Spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress. At least it was only $5. Unfortunately, the Corona of the person I was with only cost fifty cents less than that. $4.50 for a warm Corona? Do not want.\n\nSERVICE: Nice, but few and far between.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Dank, dirty, sticky... these are only a few of the descriptors for this place. I fear the day where I will have no choice but to use the facilities here.\n\nOverall: \nDon't waste your time and money. I hear there's better places in this area, I just need to find them."""
"2,""I don't much like the look of this place - I never would have ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews - but they serve some pretty good pizza.  \n\nI have eaten trillions of pizzas.  Maybe more, I lost count.  And I'm not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza.  I grew up in Chicago, where I was weaned on deep dish, pan, and thin crust pizzas.  I lived in NYC for years, and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet.  (for the record, my favorites are DiFara's in Brooklyn and Coalfire, a relatively young pizza joint in Chicago).\n\nBrixx does a fine job of the thin crust.  We had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks.  Both were pretty tasty.    I'll go back for more whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nBut here's what they could do a little better:\n\nGet that oven hotter, and change the flour blend so that there's a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust.  There's an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like, \""""if that shit don't crack, that shit is whack.\""""  So, when the pizza is folded, the bottom of the crust should crack.  Ditto for the edge of the crust.  (Allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust, like spinach, ricotta, etc.)\n\nBrixx's pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere.  It was cooked only to the point of being bread-like.  Still tasty enough, but not quite there.  I hate to sound snotty about this, but I think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning.  That crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible.\n\nAlso, the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula, but when that was added, the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didn't melt at all, and the arugula didn't wilt.  The result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza.\n\nPizza aside, they offer local beers, at least one NC wine, and have eco-friendly waterless urinals in the men's room (I applaud the effort, though that probably won't be the highlight of the review).\n\nNext time I go in, I'll see it they can crispify my pie."""
"2,""This is our first time coming to Brixx and we really enjoyed it. We ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola and the Bronx Bomber. The  Pear and Gorgonzola was unique. The Bronz Bomber had good flavor and a nice balance of ingredients. Personally I would have like them to be a little more crispy. But, that's just a personal preference. \n\nWhat I really liked was that the manager came to each table to introduce himself and make sure the customers were happy. It's rare to see managers touch tables! Great customer service and great food"""
"2,""Good food at the right prise. The wait staff was friendly and helpful when ordering. Enjoy the night and eat outside!"""
"2,""I finally got a chance to eat here thanks to one of my friends very generous Christmas gift!! Ive only ever been in for drinks so dinner was a first!!\n\nWe sat in a big booth for just the 3 of us and I started with the Pineapple Stoli Doli and it is dangerous! I could have had like 10...I didn't but i could have! We started with the Shrimp Cocktail and Wagyu Beef Carpaccio both were good. \n\nFor my entree I had the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico Ribeye when it came out it was huge and perfectly cooked. We had gotten 3 sides starting with the Lobster Mac N Cheese which was very good, but like my friend said there was nothing that made it OMG!! We also had the Onion Rings, and Sauteed Spinach which were also good.\n\nWe had the Creme Brulee for dessert and that was perfectly lighter than I thought it was going to be and just the right amount of sweetness to finish the dinner.\n\nOur server was very nice and helped when it came to picking out the wine and his suggestion was great we all enjoyed it!"""
"2,""My mouth is watering just thinking of the Capital Grille in Charlotte. I don't get to come here that often considering the price tag, but when I do, it's always nothing short of super fantastic. This particular Capital Grille is very classy from the service to decor to the selections of food and wine. The staff is very attentive, professional and informative. The food is insanely delicious and could feed you for days on end! \n\nCapital Grille, hands down, receives my Best Cheesecake in Charlotte award! I usually describe their cheesecake as this: \""""It's a NY cheesecake, with a cookie dough-like crust instead of a graham cracker crust, and with a creme-brulee sugar-flambeed topping.\"""" It's freakin' unbelievable! I would get just that cheesecake to-go on a random night if I ever wanted to! \n\nBut I digress... They also have a nice patio on the sidewalk of Tryon and 5th St. if you fancy people-watching while you enjoy a 4 course meal. They've also just added a lunch bites menu that is for those who need to eat and run at a much smaller price than their usual dinner fare.\n\nCapital Grille is just the place to go if you're looking to impress business clients, for a classy date night or for a special occasion with family or friends. Make a reservation and be prepared to eat/drink like royalty and drop money like you're makin' it rain!"""

Two sodas that you would pay $2 - $3 for at a fast food place cost $12.\n\nI also ordered a Jerk Chicken Sandwich.  Did it come straight from the refrigerator?  Cold cold cold.\n\nBack to the concessions, why do we... the Joe Q. Publics of the world put up with that?

"1,""Maybe it's because I went on a Thursday with colleagues, but apparently it's R&B night or Jazz night or something.  They play some old school CDs really loud so it's hard to maintain a decent conversation.  On top of that, it's old school CDs bc the music would skip.  We asked them to turn it down (off) and their response was: It's R&B night.  Uh, so who cares? Literally, there was us and 2 old cougars sitting at the bar - that's about it. Note: We were not sitting with these cougars, but the amount of times they were looking over at our table, I thought it was feeding time - feeling like a piece of meat, sheesh!  Hardly a R&B night if you ask me!  Beers were fine, I liked the multitude of screens.  But it's so dead on Thursday bc of Jazz Night!  Just giving them a heads up, let's trash that idea, yeah? :)  \n\nLol, 2 other corporate dudes walked in, was looking around, saw cougars + music skipping and peaced out.  We totally should have done that.\n\ndmo out."""

They are all super friendly and damn good at slinging drinks. These are the same masterminds involved in Tyber Creek, Dandelion and Prohibition. They know what they're doing.\n\nThe patio is huge. Perfect for after work cocktails or Sunday funday. Cornhole, tables, TVs. Pick your poison. Speaking of poison, if you're in the mood for a car bomb... go here to get it.

They had great toys that she responded enthusiastically toward. \n\nWhen I returned for the proof appt it was difficult to pay attention because I had my daughter with me and she was all over the place.

Smear on cream cheese add slick things like lettuce and cucumber and now you have a very messy meal. The cream cheese is of sort of like grease on a Bush Hog - everything wants to squirt out.

"1,""We went to Dixie's Tavern before the Bobcats Arena opened (i.e., when you could find free parking in Uptown).  We parked in Seventh Street Station (for free back then) and walked across the street to Dixie's.   Places like Roadhouse Grill, Logan's Roadhouse, and Texas Roadhouse are designed to look a bit rundown and...like a roadhouse.  Dixie's was unpurposefully like that.  It was smoky, a bit dirty, and a bit haggard in its appearance.  \n\nWe had a large group and Dixie's was able to accommodate us together.  The service we received was slllllllllooooooooow.  It was a good thing we didn't have anywhere to be, but I was losing my buzz in between beers.  The food was average"
"1,""Very poor customer service. Have a special listed saying 10 items for 39.95 but if you have 11 items they charge you full price and you are not eligible for the cheaper rate.

"1,""When parking uptown, they are really your only option.  Which is fine, as some of their lots have reasonable rates.  My reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing, and their overall customer service.\n\nMy main problem with them (aside from rude people), is that there is no way to update your payment information online.  My credit card was cancelled, and upon receiving my new card (mid-March), I called immediately to update my information so, come April, they would have updated information.  Obviously I would have much rather done this all online, but alas, there was no other option but to call.  They assured me that the new card was placed on file, and we were good to go.  Fast forward to April 5th, and I receive an email saying that my card did not go through and I would be fined an additional $25.  THEY HAD CHARGED THE WRONG CARD.  They sent me this email on Saturday afternoon, and I immediately called, only to be told that the people who handle payments don't work on weekends and I would need to call back during business hours (the girl could have been a lot nicer).\n\nI call first thing Monday morning, and explain what happen--not in an accusing tone by any means, because I'm well aware that the likelihood of the girl I was speaking to having made this mistake was slim, so why yell at the messenger?  She immediately responded in a defensive tone, saying there is no way that error could have occurred, and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.  I tried to explain again the course of events, and she would not have it.  She updated my credit card information, now for the second time, so let's see if it goes through for May.\n\nOverall, here is how I feel:\n\n+Tremendous amount of parking options offered in Uptown\n-Poor customer service\n-Poor user experience\n-Overpriced\n\nIf you're going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year, at least give me decent people.

There was a cockroach wing, not in a corner, but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor. The chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained. I stayed at the Westin just 2 weeks before and the Omni couldn't even hold a candle to that place. I have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel? It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever. \nThere is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price.\nWe had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night.

I started by ordering a couple bottles of wine and one came incorreclty which was pretty bad considering I ordered it by number.  The waiter had all the personality of a rock.  Ok no biggie, but then came the food.  I ordered a  chicken breast that was supposed to come with hushpuppy breaded shrimp and some type of ravioli.  The food came out at different times which left some of our food getting cold.  When my chicken showed up it appeared to be boiled and had some really bad sauce on it that I can't explain.  It was pretty unedible after a couple of bites.  Also the shrimp came  butterflied and sauteed(?) definatly not as described on the menu.

When it arrived, it was pretty obvious that the Ahi Tuna was old and on its way to being rancid.  I was appalled that any real Chef would ever serve anything that looked that bad.  I was in a business setting where I did not want to make a scene so I ate only the vegetables and did not touch the Tuna for fear of getting sick.  The waitress never ask me if there was anything wrong with my dish even though it should have been obvious to her that I pretty much left the fish untouched.

I've tried Athletic Conditioning, and while it certainly is an awesome workout, make sure you're at least in decent shape before you partake in that class! It's a rough one. \n\nAs other reviewers have noted, this gym can get packed especially after 5 pm during the weekdays. So be patient while parking. Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment. \n\nI haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker.

That's right - one test per day!\n\nThe test would usually be run in mid-morning, and the results would come back mid-afternoon, at which point they would try and find someone to interpret the test results, which could take until after dinner, and by the time that happened, it would be night time, and then another test would be ordered for the next day.

The veggie pita is no good...clearly designed by someone who has never eaten food without meat on it.

Once inside it's actually a really nice place.  The service is great, the waitresses are very friendly and attentive and really cared that we had a good time.  There is live music on some nights which always makes for a good time.  Looking at the other reviews, I think the food is kind of hit or miss.  I guess I was lucky with the red beans and rice, it was really good by my standards at least."""

The menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive. The prices were on the high side of expensive. Thank goodness for the coupon. \n\nService was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere. I could have used a smile from someone but it didn't come. The portions that came with my meal were just the way I like them. Not too much but enough for a good dinner.

"1,""I'm not an avid go-karter but I've been enough times to know what to expect.  This go-kart establishment is by far the worst that I've been to. I've been to go karting in places in LA, Boston, and Vegas and what all of those places had that this lacked was a safety/training person/video to tell you what the safety rules are.  This place, all you do is sign up via computer, pay your way and you (not guided) look for the entrance to put your track suit on. No one in the room to tell you what to put on. No one in the room to tell you where to go. So you find your way to the track and wait in the line to drive. Again, no training video, no guide to tell you what is what, what the rules are, etc. You just get in your car and drive. I wouldn't mind the lax safety/security procedures so much if my brother and I didn't get YELLED at by the manager/owner on the track. His exact words were, \""""WHERE ON PLANET EARTH CAN YOU STILL DRIVE WITH YELLOW LIGHTS FLASHING?\""""  If I'm expected to stop at yellow lights on your track, you've got to tell me before we start racing.

"1,""One of my least favorite airports.  The flights I end up taking into Charlotte (e.g., STL to PHF) invariably seem to have me jumping across a few terminals to make my connection.  You'd think the situation would be improved by the huge number of moving walkways connecting the different gates, but there is NOTHING more infuriating than being stuck behind a family of four blocking the entire walkway, or someone slowly trudging along on the left.\n\nFor god's sake, people: Just like on the road, pass on the left, walk on the right.  There are people in this airport, obviously not you, that are in a HURRY.\n\nCan't speak much to the food and drink options here.  The selections seem plentiful.

That's a deal breaker for me. Security checks are here to stay, do something about it. \n\n- TSA agents are often rude and overly aggressive. Yes, compared to other big cities. \n\n- Employing bathroom attendants, News Break: hello, the fifties are over! \n\n- Not enough airlines service Charlotte or compete for its business. \n\n- Not enough direct flights in or out.

I believe they also have have sacrament available for communion but you need to contact staff. \nBeing Muslim I really appreciated the quiet serenity to be able to pray without feeling rushed to do so.

While it some of it is dated, K-Mart still carries the much-touted Martha Stewart brands.  I've found a 'runner' rug and bedspread that both look like something from department stores.  The same can be said for the furniture, so don't hate on my stylish house. \n\nThe clothing department is slightly dicier, but I have scavenged some faddish clothes (think Gap 3 years ago) among the Big Bubba t-shirts and overalls.  Their young men's section has good deals at the end of the season, like utility shirts or those really metrosexual boot-cut jeans for less than $15.  Yeah....really.\n\nThe rest of the store is pretty much filler.  If you actually go to this K-Mart ( or any K-Mart) looking for a decent selection of sporting goods/shoes/electronics, you will likely pay more than other big box retailers or be appalled by the selection.

I did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town, but not a big deal.  I ordered the 1/4 Barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries.

Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated, there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up.

The apts have 30+ year old appliances and we were told, well if they work then they are working by design and we can't replace them. But did I mention that they raised the rent after the 1st year? for what.. no property improvements have been made.

Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. \n\nThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue.

It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.\n\nSushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.\n\nPresentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.  \n\nSake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum. \n\nRamen - the soup was very tasty.  \n\nOverall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip.

I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like. \n\nBecause I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice."""

It used to be one of my favorites...I remember going to a conference and I ate at the PF Chang's across the street from my hotel every day. \n\nThis last time there was pure disappointment. From the quality of the food, to the service, to the taste it was as if I was at some cheap fast food joint. Each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base. It was way too salty! Since when did they start rationing out their rice? We got a very tiny portion of rice and we had to keep asking for more to soak up the salty sauce on the dish. Blah. The service was super slow to greet us at the table and to bring us what we needed. Made for a very unenjoyable experience. \n\nBlah...and I'm sad that it wasn't better."""

"1,""I've only been here 2x and both times had a pedicure and gel manicure. The first time was okay, but the nail tech was rather snotty and had attitude the entire time. PLEASE, if you are offering \""""discount\"""" for customers paying in cash you have no reason to be a snot! Give me a break! The 2nd time I had the same snotty tech and she was just as expected-snotty! The pedicure was a joke and they basically do a quick rub and no true callus removal at all. The dryers they use for the gel manicure are old and trashy and have a handmade taped cardboard piece in the middle of it to help you place your hands correctly so that the gel actually adheres. Well guess what, it didn't work and my thumbs were actually chipping the next day when a gel manicure should last 1.5-2 weeks. It wasn't worth dealing with them to go back and have it fixed so instead I'll just let everyone know not to go there and instead go elsewhere."""

Also, when I asked for more pancake syrup she brought me the almost empty (used) syrup from the neighboring table.... yuck!"""
"1,""We went on a Saturday morning and had to wait almost an hour to be seated.  My egg white omelette was runny, so I sent it back.  We are now an hour and twenty minutes into our dining experience and I still have no food that is edible.  When the omelette returned, they had done something to the eggs to make them ultra-fluffy, which sounds like it would be good, but it wasn't.  It was literally like eating a kitchen sponge.  My son and husband got pancakes and said that the ones we make at home are better.\n\nOh, I should add that we went to the one by the Target near uptown."""
"1,""I do not get it.  Why does this place get voted Best Breakfast?!  We had been once before and the pancakes tasted funky and the eggs tasted fishy.

I had a terrible Dr. Pepper craving at like midnight and was able to get one downstairs.. thank goodness! I also grabbed coffee in the morning only to have my boss tell me we were going to Starbucks and I accidentally said RIGHT in front of the desk clerk - \n\n\""""Oh! then i won't drink this crappy coffee... \"""" \n\nI felt so bad as soon as I said it.. i am sure it is not crappy! \n\nI would stay here again, it was comfortable and affordable.

What else would you expect from an establishment that has linen tablecloths? \n\nMy favorite times to go to Upstream has been for brunch and Thanksgiving . Their brunch is a tad on the high side ($25 I believe) but completely worth it just for a bite of the Brioche French Toast alone.  Along with that I've gone there for Thanksgiving dinner twice and was nothing but pleased with it. They have a complete traditional Thanksgiving spread set up in their bar along with sushi, cooked seafood and other goodies. \n\n\nAt the risk of sounding like George Costanza, they have one of the nicest restrooms I've seen in Charlotte. They also have a cute patio area with cushioned seats that's perfect to enjoy an after work cocktail on and watch the people of Phillips Place. And dare I say, even though it's in the heart of South Park-not an obnoxious number of misbehaved children .

"1,""I really wanted to love Upstream, but it totally fell flat. We sat in the bar for some apps and drinks after a movie, and it was one disappointment after the next. The biggest disappointment of all was the management (and this is speaking from two people who worked and lived off of tips in the service industry for years). We weren't looking for anything but an acknowledgment and somehow felt like we were the ones causing problems.....so what happened...\n\nWe ordered shrimp dumplings and they came out raw. We sent them back and somehow were left to feel like we were being unreasonable. Call me crazy, but expect food to be cooked and want to make sure there are no risks to eating said food. New ones came out (they were great) but TOTALLY different than first ones of which the management said were \""""slightly undercooked\"""" and he was \""""trained that most food was sushi grade.\"""" Call me crazy again, but just admit the mistake and we all feel good. \n\nLastly the bill came and Upstream has the audacity to charge $3.50 an oyster for Wellfleets ($42/dozen). Whaaaat!! I'm a Boston gal who knows her seafood. Never in my life have I seen someone charge that amount. Nevermind that the menu says they are $2.50 but they all of a sudden claimed it was a premium oyster at a different price.\n\nI can forgive mishaps and mistakes - it happens to the best of us. I cannot accept management who is so cavalier and dismissing to their guests.\n\nPrices are high here and that is no issue for me for great food and service, however not acceptable if you can't deliver on those fronts."""
"2,""Recently joined the YMCA and this is my \""""home\"""" ymca.  I LOVE the equipment and 'most' of the staff.

At either time it isn't overwhelmingly crowded.\n\nI will say at 5 am (and I assume other times) there are plenty of meat heads in the weight room - grunting, slamming weights, flexing in the mirror.  I also  find it entertaining to see the fashion show that occurs in the weight room (I like to ppl watch between sets).   I have NEVER seen so many coordinated work clothes in my entire life.  Matching shows, pants/shorts/shirts and often times hats.

"2,""\""""The little hippie food market that could\"""" seems so out of place in the \""""corridor of crap\"""" that is Independence Boulevard, but I gotta tell 'ya this store is amazing for just about any special dietary need.\n\nThe star of this market is the aisle-long bulk foods section that puts anything at our other local grocery stores to shame.  Whether you need dried fruits, spices, or nuts or grains (even candies), I'm pretty sure they have it here, and also have it as an organic option.  You get as much as you need and then write the code on the side of the bag to be weighed at the checkout.\n\nThey also have just about every homeopathic remedy you could need too.  Again, you can get herbs by bulk or just about any nutrient/supplement your heart desires.  Big selection of incense and candles too.\n\nIf you have gluten allergies, this ought to be your go-to, they have a bigger selection than I have seen just about anywhere else.  Also, vegetarian/vegan friends will find a healthy supply and selection of different options here too.  They have a fresh produce section that is small, but can do in a pinch- same goes for fresh meats and frozen foods.  I'd still look elsewhere for regular shopping for these items, however.\n\nI have to deduct a start here because the store does get a little crowded-feeling and just has the appearance of being somewhat rundown (like most of its neighboring businesses) which is far below the standard at any of the other speciality grocers in town.  Still, the store is never loaded with people and the staff is most helpful if approached.  I still don't know why they put this store where it is, but I'm not going to complain because I'm glad it's there."""
"1,""We took my wife's Sorento into for service on her A/C for the first time in March. They told us it was her compressor and they replaced it. Luckily we had a extended warranty and they covered most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a bad control unit and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit. They ordered a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to get Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out. They had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us. My wife went in when we were finished dealing with Folger to get a receipt to give to Dale Jarrett and Mike Melton treated her horribly. I will NEVER use or recommend Folger Kia to anyone. They are dishonest and their customer service is terrible. If you have to use a Kia dealer go to Dale Jarrett. It isn't that far but your experience will be so much better."""

It's quite tasty but a little spicy for my taste. Next time note to self to order only #2. Luckily, the waiter was very prompt in refilling my drink. The garlic naan was sooo yummy! I can eat that for dinner with the sauce of Chicken Palak. I wish this place only 10 minutes away from my home..."""
"2,""I can only comment on carry out. \n\nI have ordered carry out food from here a number of times and am always impressed. I typically get a shrimp or chicken dish, and soup. It is definitely above average Chinese food. I guess that's why its more expensive than most Chinese places."""
"1,""Went to Thai House on a Thursday around 8PM.  A few others were in the restaurant but not crowded at all.  Like other reviewers, I liked the dress of the servers and the decor of the place was pretty cool.  I sat in a booth by myself and was immediately greeted by the server with a menu.\n\nI ordered a Green Tea Sake...SOOO GOOD!  It came in a little glass bottle and it called Sake2Me.  I plan to buy it!\n\nAs I enjoyed my sake, I ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings.  Totally not what I expected...two roll-like, dough things came out and it tasted like it looked...just like raw dough stuffed with lots of crunchy lettuce-like pieces and tiny chopped meat.  I didn't see any shrimp, not even mini shrimp.  I was thinking they brought me the wrong item but when I didn't eat my dough, the waiter said \""""You don't like your shrimp dumpling?\"""" I didn't have the heart (or the energy after a long day of travel) to say anything except \""""I want to have room for my Pad Thai\"""".  So, I awaited my Chicken Pad Thai hoping it was what I am used to.\n\nThe Pad Thai wasn't bad...not great, but not bad.  Once in a while, I got the taste of mayonaisse but I was starving at this point and it did the trick.  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasn't worth the risk of Pad Thai all over my rental car.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll go back to Thai House.  i will certainly look for an alternative next time I'm in town.  If I'm starved and can't find any other place, I'll probably give Thai House another shot...I'll just stay away from anything that says \""""dumpling\""""."""
"2,""We loved our Thai place in Boston and really missed having someplace to go get Pad Thai. We moved into the area and found this place and fell in love with it.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is beautiful and really clean. The staff are all really nice and attentive. They have takeout, which works for us since we live a few blocks away.\n\nI thought the food was great. We've tried a few different meals. My wife does not enjoy very spicy food and the mild versions suit her fine. I do like my food spicy and if I had one complaint it's that I wouldn't mind if the spicy dishes were a little hotter than what I've experienced so far. The food has great flavors and think it is spot on."""
"1,""We went to Nakato last night for dinner.  The food was average in taste, much smaller portions and higher prices than before, and the service was not good at all.  We waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check.  My wife had to remind the waiter that she hadn't gotten her sushi order.  We had a coupon and they added 18% for a gratuity, per the coupon, which we didn't see beforehand -- the coupon is a scam so watch out.  We wouldn't have tipped that much based on the above comments.  Our table mates asked for a birthday greeting which never happened.  Yes, we have been eating here for 15 plus years but likely will not return as things have declined so much recently.  No one ever came to our table to ask how things were going -- a sign of poor customer relations."""
"2,""Craving Thai-ish and need a quick lunch? Hit up Bangkok Ocha, son. \n\nI met hubs here for a very speedy lunch where their lunch special includes iced tea, house soup and a noodle dish w/egg roll for $7.95. Oh, and it comes out in about 10 minutes flat. That's fast. \n\nAnd the food? Not too shabby! The house soup is a total bust for me - it's a corn egg drop soup. Yeah. Not sure where that came from, but it tastes like a watered down egg chowder for me. I'll pass on that. But, I ordered the pad see ew (which on their menu reads pud see ew) and it was quite tasty. A generous portion of chopped up flat, rice noodles with a soy sauce base, a bit of broccoli and bits of tender chicken. Considering it was lunch and I still had meetings to get to, I asked for a 3-star spice level (out of 5 stars) and it had quite a bit of heat! \n\nThe service is quick and efficient and they definitely know how to turn those tables around during lunch time! While it's not my favorite Thai food in Charlotte, it's a nice quick and affordable option in South Charlotte."""
"1,""I feel like discount or bargain stores like Burlington Coat Factory are a hit or miss. Sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times, you miss out.  I've never lucked out here.\n\nI give most stores that I see potential the rule of 5's... You miss a truck of new goodies, you're between seasons, etc. BCF, well, let's just say I've walked in 5 times and never bought anything... Not once.\n\nI think the big reason I've come away with nothing is the store set-up.  it's so crammed and so messy.  Bad store planning for the lay-out and inconsiderate shoppers who make a disgusting mess.  I did give an extra star for the staff. They've always been friendly and helpful, which always means a lot to me.\n\nI'd rather go anywhere else but BCF - Check the sale racks at Belk or head to Ross before you consider here."""
"2,""My wife and I ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary.  The interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations. The menu had also changed with some items doubling in price.  A coworker of my wife had given her a $25 gift card for Christmas.\nWe ordered sweet teas and a Bloomin onion. The onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning.  My wife had the chicken tenders and I had the pork tenderloin.  It wa a good but wasn't outstanding. At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious."""
"2,""Great Way to Spend the 4th.\n\nBeen awhile since I've been to Outback and they have revamped the menu a bit.  Slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings. Also, at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well.\n\nMy wife had here favortie Alice Springs Chicken.  Normally I would go with a Beef Entree but opted for a new offering of Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken with a side of mixed vegetable.\n\nOnly negative was the bread they served. It was a very dark bread that looked with an Eastern European bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor.  Fortunately that was the only downside.\n\nMy Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken was great.  The flavors and textures complimented themselves well.  My wife was also happy with her Alice Springs Chicken which again, is her normal order at Outback.\n\nService was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign.\n\nAtmosphere --- What can I say?  Typical Outback.\n\nIf you're in the Carolina Place Mall Area, this is a nice spot for Dinner and now Lunch"""
"1,""This is now called Cabo's Mexican Grill. \n\nThis is the 2nd time visiting and 2nd time being disappointed. The first time I went with a group of 3 other friends. The service was less than okay and food was mediocre, nothing really memorable.\n\nThe 2nd time was a couple of weeks ago, name change but the bad service stayed.\n\nWent with a group of about 8 - 10 people on a Thursday night. Right of the top we realized that the waiter was less than eager to serve us. We ordered drinks and our food, food took longer than what we expected even with a big group. The server never filled up our water glasses and kept forgetting things we asked for. To make matters worse, the manager seemed to notice our struggles so he came over and asked what we needed, we told him and to our surprise he never came back with what we asked. Worst part, we were so ready to leave and couldn't, our checks where laying at a table next to us but we must have waited 30 minutes for our waiter to show up and pick them up. \n\nI am rating it 3 stars because the place was clean and the food here might have been okay but the terrible service didn't let us enjoy it."""
"2,""Totally enjoyed my experience with Craig at Uptown Retreat.  All of the staff were very friendly and eager to help.  My friend and I were both in from out of town and scheduled two blow outs and one cut.  Craig was my stylist and Davis did my friends hair.  Both guys did an excellent job!  Craig you 'get it'....hair length, face shape, hair cut, and most importantly the blow out and style!  Not many stylists can bring it all together like you did! Thank you..now will you please come to my town!?!?  Oh...and I loved the corner location of your chair....had an awesome view while getting my hair did! :-)"""
"1,""This week, I took my son to see the \""""Chipmunks Squeakquel\"""" (or whatever it's called). We've been here several times before, since it is in the University City area near where we live. \n\nThere is plenty of parking. Lines for tickets are usually long, and uncomfortable in the cold, blowing wind of December, or the humid summer heat, for that matter. (Why can't they put the ticket counters on the INSIDES of theaters? This is one tradition that should be broken soon!)  Matinee tickets for the two of us were $13.50. \n\nThe theater itself is in good shape. Movies are usually in focus, and the sound is usually okay, with some distortion, but not great. (Frankly, DVDs sound better in my living room.)\n\nBUT: Concessions are a complete rip-off. I usually know this, but Jay talked me into it. We got a medium (huge!) popcorn, two \""""small\"""" bladder-busting drinks, and a box of Twizzlers. Twenty friggin' bucks! I'm sure the DVD wouldn't cost $33.50 to buy, and we could watch it over and over. (I doubt we'll be buying it... the movie is grade B entertainment. Funny once, but pretty stupid to watch as a rerun.)\n\nThe restroom had no paper towels, and the trash cans were overflowing. A smell of stale vomit permeated the area by the sinks. \n\nFor a family, I think money spent on a large LCD TV and a home theater in a box sound system is a wise investment. Rent movies from Red Box or Netflix, or hook up an Apple TV or something similar, and you have a better \""""movie-NOT-going\"""" experience. \n\nI can make much better (and less expensive!) popcorn, and the adults and I can have a beer. AND, I can pause the movie for those all-important, \""""Let's all go to the lobby\"""" breaks.\n\nEvery time I go to the theater to see a flick on the big screen, I'm more and more disappointed by the experience. I guess a lot of others feel the same way, since the theater we were in was nearly empty.\n\nIt's a pity"
"1,""My new coworkers invited me to go get \""""cheap mexican\"""" with them for lunch. Now, from where I work, you could walk to more skeevy, run down looking, hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand, and I'm pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious (as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be). Unfortunately, I can not report on any of them, because we drove by them and went to Zapatas.\n\nI won't say that Zapata's was bad, partially because i don't think it is deserved and partially because it feels like I am giving credit for more effort than they earned. While the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor, that was the high point of the meal. We ate off the lunch menu, and I went with the enchilada and taco plate. The meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful. The taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf. The rice was bland and slightly overcooked. I do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a jarred sauce. The low point was definitely the refried beans, which are often my favorite part. I took one mouthful, found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad, cold congealed mess.\n\nI have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal, well in that case creepy, unpleasant service can cement a bad impression. Despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section, our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over. He gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break.\n\nThe only reason I can imagine returning to Zapata's would be at my coworkers request, and even then I might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich I brought from home. Oh, and as for that \""""cheap\"""" bit. The lunch pricing is in the 6-10 dollar range, which isn't particularly remarkable when there are tacos to be found for under 2 bucks."""
"1,""Um...no!\n\nChips are obviously from bags.  Salsa were runny and definitely not spicy.  (Remember - \""""made in New York City?!?!?)\n\nI had the carne asada.  It was ok.  I usually devour the entire place but I just couldn't get into it.  The rice was bland.\n\nOverall, it was just disappointing!  I should have just eaten at Qdoba which was nearby.\n\nService was mediocre. \n\nMoral: just because it is right next to the hotel doesn't mean food is gonna be awesome."""
"1,""My family visited the restaurant recently. There was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family. The manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional. We are hard working people. We expect good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly. We have never been treated so disrespectfully. There was not even an offer of, \""""I'm sorry for the misunderstanding\"""".....Attention all managers: Being apologetic in the face of controversy doesn't suggest a weakness. There was not even an attempt to right the wrong. We work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation. My level of disappointment can not be expressed any further than saying.....This was really awful treatment of guests in your restaurant. No words......"""
"1,""I was hoping the previous reviewer had merely had a bad stay and/or the property had updated since then, but no such luck.\n\nThe beds here are ROCKS!  It felt like I was sleeping on a box spring instead of a mattress and a really had and painful one at that.  When we \""""got up\"""" in the morning (that phrase in quotations as it implies we had a good night's sleep, which we didn't) my husband pointed out that the side of the mattress was slumping, so it was probably very old.  Definitely not Marriott standard.\n\nWireless internet was slow, but a CAT5 was provided in the room for laptops that got internet up to speed just fine.\n\nBreakfast when I had it was good.  Perhaps previous reviewer came down late?  A little on the crowded side, but the biscuits were delicious.\n\nAll in all, the stay was great except for the beds, but unfortunately that's a HUGE thing that needs to be good when you're staying at a hotel.

"2,""The location is right on... across the street from UNCC and next store to Brueggers, I have spent many of nights cramming for a test or getting my caffeine fix before work. Since this Starbucks is very small and always busy you have to keep you eye on a table and pounce when one comes available. The baristas are my favorite in Charlotte, they have pretty much memorized my order. They're speedy and always friendly. Good thing Starbucks is building a larger location in the same shopping center."""
"1,""I came into a wealth of free bagel & cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out.  I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either.  I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays.  The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5. \n\nI finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese.  The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket.  The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating.  The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel.  After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel.  In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow.\n\nI feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires."""
"2,""Well kept secret in University City. Took the kids for a day out. Very affordable prices. $5 for each game per person. 25 cents for the video games.

Great spot to get to if you want to get out with the kids or have a date night out with the missus. A+++++ Now that's what's up!!!!"""
"1,""We went on a Friday night as packed as it looked we actually went right in and got a table. The waitress was good and always on point with service. \n\nAs for the food I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The shrimp were really good. As for the ribs they showed you shouldn't order ribs unless its a BBQ place. They were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry. Some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water. My wife ordered the steak, sadly a majority of that 10oz consisted of nothing but fat. \n\nTo top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass. They were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear your own self think. I don't mind people being loud but c'mon you don't go to a restaurant and get blitzed. But from the way it seemed the manager and servers acted like its an everyday thing so what do I know I was just eating there. \n\nEating there made me realize why I never actually go eat there.

"1,""I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great, chain or otherwise, the food was blah. First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.\n\nOur waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).\n\nWe had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \""""bones\"""" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.\n\nHaving read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \""""lunch\"""" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \""""fire roasted corn\"""" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. "
"1,""Usually asking the server what is her favorite dish gets you a pretty good recommendation, but in this case, it was crap!  The smoked brisket had that discoloration that happens to meat when it's been sitting out for a while.  And it wasn't even tender!!  Am I asking for too much?"""
"1,""Had the opportunity to visit Smokey Bones this week. I had the rib & chicken (White Meat- they were out of dark meat) combo. It was actually pretty good.

"2,""I'll cut right to the tender, juicy heart of Longhorn...its a great chain steakhouse, and as far as I am concerned, it puts Outback to shame.  Their STEAK and SERVICE are just flat-out better in my mind than Outback.  I am not an Outback hater or anything, its just than when I tell people about Longhorn, the response I usually get is, \""""Why don't you just go to Outback??\""""  Well here's what keep's me coming back to Longhorn instead...\n\n*Steaks are always juicy, tender and cooked to perfection.  I've never had a bad or less than satisfactory steak at Longhorn.  I usually order the 7oz. Flo's Filet.  Don't worry, 7oz. of quality steak is more than what you think, and is more than enough for most people (see pics).  \n\n*I love the Crab and Lobster dip (see pics).  I order this almost every time I go here.  I don't know if the crab and lobster are imitation or not, and to be honest, I really don't care.  All I know, is that it is a stellar appetizer and puts the overrated Blooming onion to shame as far as appetizers go.\n\n*I love the mash-potatoes.  I just wish they would cut back on the butter a little bit.  I mean we all love butter, but no one's trying to sacrifice their life for it.  I recommend asking for lite butter on the mash-potatoes if you choose to order them as a side to go with your entree.\n\n*I love the brown bread that they serve before the meal.  It's good, but it's better when its warm and fresh, and I've had some non-fresh bread before.  I can't say that the bread is consistently better than Outback's.\n\n*The service is always top-notch.  Everyone from the hostess, to the manger to the servers are extremely friendly and polite.  Drinks are always promptly refilled and orders are always correct.  \n\n*They do serve a few select beers on draft such as Bud Light and Blue Moon, but beware, they aren't cheap and can turn a reasonably priced dinner into an expensive one very quickly.

"1,""We went here for lunch last week. The place is very small, cramped. They only have like 4 little tables that seat two people and one that sits four. The place was completely packed as it was lunch hour in the Galleria area. Service was slow and kinda confusing.\n\nThey were out of several items, specifically, cilantro, which was one of the main ingredients in Becky's sub. The problem wasn't that they were out, but that they failed to tell her this until the sub was in mid-production.\n\nMine was fine as far as production and taste but for a toasted sub, it was barely warm.\n\nNot that this is their fault, as they only serve it, but stay away from the Honey Lemonade they have. It's disgusting.\n\nThe place was fairly clean and well stocked and organized. The staff were friendly. The two main sandwich guys spoke very little English so I had to repeat my order a couple of times to confused looks. To boot, they sandwich guys spoke different languages from each other so you can tell there was some confusion and even a little bickering back and forth.

"2,""This Goodwill is probably the busiest in Charlotte and has above-average selection in each dept.

Unlike other stores, they have a steady rotation of new titles, nearly new for really cheap.\n\nI'm regularly surprised by their furniture selection.  If my house wasn't cluttered like your grandma's crib, I would pick up a table or even a couch here!  Also, this place is freakin' Mecca for used appliances.  I always see a selection of used microwaves, coffee makers, and blenders.

"1,""I went to Cute Nails over the weekend. It was my third nail salon that I have frequented in the Charlotte area. This place paled in comparison to the other two. It was a decent environment inside. The pedicure I got was only $25 which is a good price. As someone else mentioned, the water was very hot. The chairs are old and not very effective at massaging. My chair cut off after about five minutes and would not go back on. I am also used to a foot massage/leg massage as part of my typical pedicure experience. She did not do this, but she did punch my feet a few times each. That was a little out of what I am used to. She did scrape off my dead skin, but she did it very lightly and left more skin on than I prefer. I am missing some nail polish on the corners of my nails. They are also cut kind of crooked. My eyebrow waxing experience wasn't so great either. She did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner. My left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out.

I called and ordered then went to pick it up, upon doing so the hostess told me the owner wasn't accepting these coupons and it's only good with a $40 or something purchase (the coupon was newly received so this wasn't news to the owner he just didn't pull them per the hostess which seems like a scam to me). I politely argued with the girl telling her it doesn't give stipulations anywhere and that's false advertising (not even sure if that's legal?) and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers (like myself). She understood but it was the owners call. I ended up purchasing the pizza (needed to eat!) and the pizza wasn't good. It had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt. Because I'm pregnant I opted not to get too stressed so after stating my views I left vowing that I wont return. Which is unfortunate because it's very close to my home but there are too many other places close enough with better food and certainly better service!"""

"1,""Ate there last night with a group of friends.  The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night.  I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.  The fries that went along with it were also extremely salty.  A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back.  I was quite bummed about this."""
"1,""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nI went there a second time because I couldn't remember if I liked the food or not (yes,it was THAT unremarkable). Upon going there the second time, I knew there would not be a third. Ever. \n\nI know this is Madison, but c'mon, I've had more authentic Chinese food at Panda Express. What should have been an immediate tip-off was the fact that there weren't any chinese words on the menu...and that all the clientele was white (again, yes I know this is Madison, but this is compared to other Chinese restaurants like Fugu or Ichiban). I don't actually remember the specific dishes I ordered (I've had fish, chicken, pork, and beef there), but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months. Dry and flavorless. \n\nThe service was also slow. They refilled our glasses only once, after we had asked for the check.\n\nI won't be going back."""
"1,""I live on the east side of Madison and I always eat at the Imperial Gardens near E. Washington and this Imperial was a let down. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff wasn't as amazing as I hoped for. \n\nFor starters, the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger. Our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down. My friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a weird sort of sour after taste. I had the pepper steak and I did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also had a strange after taste.\n\nThe staff was very kind but a little annoying. It's was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every 10min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us. We could then see her staring at us from across the room waiting to start another unwanted conversation.\n\nImperial Garden Middleton will definitely be memorable but, for all the wrong reasons."""
"2,""I really enjoyed my dinner here. I had a fantastic fajita platter, which included beef, chicken, shrimp, and the requisite peppers and onions, but also whole scallions and tomato wedges.

But I really liked the spicy salsa they brought to the table when I requested it.\n\nThe service was pretty great"
"1,""I have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store.  Today I tried going back after a year, and again the staff is so unhelpful, unknowledgeable and downright rude.

There are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers."""

"1,""This is a nice looking but poorly designed hotel. Despite having over 300 rooms, they only have 2 elevators. I was here for a convention with a friend who recently had foot surgery and needed a wheelchair. Lets just say other hotel guests were not gracious about giving us priority on the elevators even though we were on the second floor and even the largest of humans should be able to manage 1 flight of stairs with 2 good feet. Checkout was a nightmare because of this elevator situation. Fortunately a staff member was kind enough to allow us access to the service elevator after he saw how rude the guests were about this.\n\nThe food is also terrible and overpriced. Several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari. That was no fun for anybody. I highly recommend the Sprecher Brewery restaurant across the street - comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food! \n\nThe temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well. Our room was cold no matter how high we adjusted the thermstat and the convention space was hot enough that I nearly fainted on at least 2 occasions. The only reason this hotel gets 2 stars is because it was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable with their down-filled duvets and fluffy pillows."""

"1,""Does not live up to a recent review in Madison paper.  \nCons: Too pricey & ala carte.  The pasta dishes in range $15- $20. The entrees: $20 - 30. The decor needs fresh paint and new carpet  and the restroom slightly grotty. Server forgot to put in some of our order.  My ravioli vin santo was lacking flavor.  Need to serve parmesan cheese with the bread & oil.\nPlus: Nice people.  Good Tuscan mushroom soup.\nFor the tiny storefront, family restaurant it is priced too high which sets your expectations higher and does not live up to those expectations.  It would be fine for your corner Italian joint for everyday meals if they offered a salad with the meal and cut their $$."""
"1,""DO NOT GO HERE! Had my oil changed on 12/2/14. As I left the lot I pulled out onto University Ave and my car immediately died. I turned around and headed back to Jiffy Lube to see what the problem could be as my car was fine prior to the oil change. They took my car and \""""said\"""" they ran a complete diagnostic test and said that my spark plugs needed to be changed and that my battery was bad. They immediately said \""""we have a guy, would you like us to call him?\"""" I felt like I was being scammed, how can my car be completely fine prior to the oil change and then after the oil change I now need new spark plugs and possibly a new battery? I declined their offer to \""""call their guy\"""" and decided to take the chance and drive home. \n\nOnce home, i took my car to my local garage, which I should have done in the first place, and they informed me that Jiffy Lube failed to put the air filter on correctly after they changed my oil. Considering all Jiffy Lube does is change oil, I feel placing the air filter on correctly is something they do in their sleep. So, the so called diagnostic test that they ran was probably a load of BS and all they wanted to do was scam me into having \""""their guy\"""" fix my unbroken car, which probably would have cost me an arm and leg. Shame on you Jiffy Lube! Just remember, someone is more likely to share a bad customer service experience than a good one, you can bet I will be sharing this bad one!"""
"2,""I love the Capital Brewery because I think it encompasses everything that is quintessentially Wisconsin. Capital Brewery makes consistently high-quality German lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for good measure), and provides a low-key, no-frills environment that can be whatever you want it to be. The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table. And if the weather's not so nice, you can visit the Bier Stube, Capital's indoor bar, which is full of dark, rich wood and nice people. I highly recommend the Capital Brewery. And don't forget to take the short tour!"""

He was not pushy and gave us all the information we needed to make a decision.\n\nZimbrick made a very fair offer to trade in the Mini but we ended up selling it ourselves. Once my wife's car was sold, Otto made the process very quick and easy so we had her in her new Passat the same day.

"1,""This review is strictly based on the Sun Prairie location and is only a review on the service received, not the food. I have had Papa Murphy's pizza at other locations and the pizza was good. Unfortunately at this location I wasn't given a chance to get a pizza. I walked into the store at 5 minutes to 8pm. 8pm is when they close. Not only did my phone, my car, and my watch indicate that it was before 8pm but the actual clock inside the store was showing 7:55. I soon as I walked into the restaurant I was told that they were closed even though there was another customer in the store getting a pizza as well. You don't even bake the pizza! How much effort would it have been to take one more order and make one more pizza? The total transaction could have been done and it still probably wouldn't have been 8! It's not like the store had already been cleaned and it would have been a hassle to reopen everything. I would have been completely understanding of that.

"2,""Classic, just like you remember.,,,,\n\nPerhaps, like me, you remember trips to the A&W as a kid on a hot summer day to get that enormous, frosty mug of sweet, cold root beer as a special treat.  I remember agonzing over the decision, ice cream cone or frosty mug of beer (parents wouldn't let us have both). \n\nI hadn't stopped into an A&W in a long, long, time and was looking for something a little less fast-foody on my drive south when I decided to stop at this A&W.  I've driven by it on the interstate a hundred times on my way back and forth from Minneapolis to Madison but had never before stopped in.\n\nI got a burger and fries, which were fine, but the real treat was a real frosty mug (eat in only) that I could fill myself at the beverage counter with straight from the barrel A&W root beer.

"2,""When I was younger, my aunt and uncle and cousins lived in Kenosha, WI.  We would drive up a few times a year to visit them, and after 2 hours of peering out the car windows along 94, my brother and cousins and I would be dying to get out of the car at any of the attractions along the way--Six Flags, the outlet malls, or any of the many cheese shops that announced your arrival to Wisconsin.  \n\nWhen I went skiing with friends at Cascade Mountain last winter, years of unfulfilled longing swept over me and I demanded that we stop at one.  The one we selected was the Mousehouse Cheesehaus, chosen mostly for it's cute sign and awesome name.  Being a lover of all things dairy walking in, I beelined for the cheese counter, demanding samples of anything and everything.  Oh my!  Anything from a basic, kid friendly American to a 15 year aged Cheddar, to their own special haus cheese.  I probably walked out with a good 2 lbs of various cheeses (and am still wondering how those seemed to add 10 lbs to my figure, but that's another story).  In addition, there were the usual Wisconsin knick knacks, including many types of beers, wines, and other kitsch-y stuff like ashtrays and bottle openers.  The woman working at the counter didn't seem too charmed by my friends and I, but I'm sure I would tire of travelers demanding cheese nibbles after a while, myself."""
"1,""Although the staff was friendly and the language was not a barrier for me as it was for others, the food I got was not very good. After I ordered the General Tso's Chicken, the woman turned on the fryer and, without waiting for the oil to heat up, she put in the chicken and my crab rangoon. Therefore, when I ate the food it wasn't crispy as a good General Tso's/crab rangoon  should be. Another thing that I noticed was that the chicken that she put in the fryer was sitting on the counter in the heat. *note: she hadn't fried any in quite some time which is why she had to turn the fryer on. The person that said the food was too sweet was right. Even though the menu said *spicy for my meal, there was no \""""zip\"""" at all.

"1,""I could visit this place four times and give it four different reviews. Today there was a long wait at the cutting table, which was (at first) staffed by three different people. The little number-giving-out machine was empty, so we all just stood in an orderly line. One of the women at the cutting table left right after I got there (there were five of us in line then) saying that she was already late for her break. I didn't like to see her go, but I understood about the break thing (sometimes you *really* need your break, and sometimes your manager *really* wants you to take your break at the scheduled time). \n\nIt took a long time to get my stuff cut because one women kept cutting but the other one was helping a customer track down some numbers on a fabric. If I was that customer I'd have been thrilled at that level of service. \n\nSo I finally got my stuff cut. The woman cutting it was very efficient (but I think a little rattled from being so busy) and admired my choice of fabric (hey, I love to be validated). \n\nI went up front and stood in line some more. There were, unusually, three different people working the registers. The woman who checked me out was mellow and chatty and also admired my fabric (I'm starting to think it's not my great taste but some new policy). \n\nSo not a great visit but not the worst, either."""

"2,""The Bridges has become my default golf course for meeting up with friends and getting in 18.  It is a city-owned course on the northeast side of Madison, south of the airport.  Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.  It is an fairly easy course to walk, except that the proximity to water does mean a good amount of mosquitoes.  The recent rains led to a lot of flooding on the course, but I played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition.  I especially like the Bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you, but there always seems to be a bit of both.  Other courses are either too hard or too easy (mostly too hard) but the Bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible.  It's enough of a challenge to keep you coming back without demoralizing you, and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the area. \n\nThe major downside to the Bridges is the proximity to the airport.  Most of the course is right on the flight path for landing jets, and this is distracting at first.  Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.  For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker, but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.\n\nThe price is very reasonable - from $22 to $37 walking 18 depending on the time.  There is a twilight special where after 6:00 PM you can golf as much as you would like for $10.  The only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow.  The bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the city-owned courses.  The bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps.  The last time I was there I enjoyed the new Capital Prairie Gold from a frosty mug.  You can always count on getting a can of Capital out on the course as well.  The menu is surprisingly broad and well-made.  The wraps are a satisfying end to the round, as are the sandwiches and the appetizers.  You can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse, which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating.  Several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too.  I think that top to bottom, the Bridges has about the best layout of the city-owned courses and is my personal favorite."""
"1,""I came through this dive while pub-crawling amongst friends.

"2,""Food is consistently good. We often go for weekend brunch. I'm from NJ, which has a lot of 24 hour diners. This is one of the only places in Madison that offers breakfast all day, so it's great in my book. Don't come if you mind long lines or kids"
"2,""Fabulous food and AWESOME atmosphere. Perfect place to take your kids or have a little date. "
"1,""Very busy and the for the floor show, I watched a small child dash back and forth from the dining area into the kitchen area and back again. Multiple times. I didn't like the floor show, so that was the last time I went there."""
"1,""I have only been here a few times. Service is pretty good but my big problem is the shakes. First time I got a shake it was really thick and almost worth the 6 bucks. I looked forward to having another some day. Last Friday I went there for another shake and it was really thin. Like chocolate milk! Maybe when teenagers are making milk shakes for minimum wage you get varied results. $6 is way too much for a watery shake. Get it together people."""
"2,""Everyone already knows how awesome Monty's Blue Plate Diner is, so I don't have to tell you that. Your carnivore and herbivore friends will love the menu. They source local ingredients, cook \""""real\"""" food and even bring in local products such as YumButter and create extra, super-duper healthy menu items by partnering with Jon Hinds at Monkey Bar Gym.\n\nHowever, I write this review because I recently ate the most amazing curry dish there. I've been craving it ever since and cannot wait to return. I'm serious, it was a hot, steaming bowl of freshly steamed vegetables with rice and a fantastic curry sauce. I want to eat this every day! Our server even told me that she actually DOES eat this every day and has since they put it on their menu. It was a huge bowl, so I took half of it home with me so I could enjoy a second meal of leftovers. \n\nNow drop everything and order this curry!\n\nAnd order a piece of pie or enjoy an iced sugar cookie, too."""
"1,""I really dislike Menard's.  For every positive interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.\n\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\n\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\n\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \n\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \n\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\n\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \n\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \n\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?  Awful/Hellish."""

"2,""I have a new found love for Indian food and when I found myself in Madison I had to check this place out. It was most excellently delicious!

"1,""Here's the lowdown:\n\nThey're like every other shop that makes you take it in the Chili Ring. They only did the bare minimum amount of work possible to align my vehicle. I know a lot about alignment, I would have done it myself if I had access to the equipment. They only adjusted the Toe-in, and reported back that the bolt which actuates the upper control arm eccentric was frozen so they couldn't make the adjustment to the caster angle. \n\nI then informed Jr. Pinhead that I have a Benzo-matic torch and can heat the bolt to loosen it, which he replied that his tech had use a torch on all the bolts. Funny thing is in the report from the equipment, all the angles were within spec that would have required heat to loosen the adjustment hardware, with the exception of the 'frozen' one.\n\nI used to work at a Firestone and I thought that lazy shit was just at my location. I was expecting this type of work from a local shop with a couple of random dopers.... not Firestone"""

"2,""A few of us hit Smoky Jon's for lunch today.  It was insisted that it's the best BBQ in Madison, so I was game to try it.\n\nThe place has character - you order at a window and go take a seat.  They bring the food out to you.  Nothing fancy - paper plates, styrofoam cups, etc.\n\nI got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries.  I snarfed a fry to start.  Not very hot... \""""warm\"""", I'd say. But tasty - salty.  Could have been better if fresh, but they'll do.  The coleslaw was the creamiest I've ever had.  The flavor wasn't strong, but it was okay.  Could have used a little salt and pepper - neither to be found.  The pork was tasty - definitely smokey.  The side of sauce made it, however.  Sweet, tangy, spicy.  While I was eating it, I thought \""""yeah, it's okay - but I wouldn't rave about it\"""".  Later, however, thinking back on the meal, I thought, \""""you know, that was REALLY good!\""""\n\nWhile it doesn't best the BBQ I've had in Memphis, it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth. I'd have it again.  I think my meal was around $9 (no drink - had a water).  I was full, and content.  Mission accomplished!\n\nMy coworker had some ribs, and they looked very good - not too fatty, cooked well.  I would like to go back and try them sometime!\n\nTip:  Limited seating, so show up early (or late!)"""
"1,""Having returned from a BBQ binge in Kansas City a few months ago, we decided we'd get ribs in celebration of the Royals making the playoffs. Then winning the pennant. And then again for Game 7 of the World Series. So we've had Smoky Jon's ribs and pork shoulder three times in three weeks.\n\nHere's what's excellent: The pork shoulder and the sauce are fantastic. Right up there with the best there is. Just yummy.\n\nHere's what's not: Extremely inconsistent ribs. (I completely agree with another reviewer regarding the membrane... it really ought to be removed, every time.Not doing so is laziness by the pitmaster.)\n\nFor us, Batch #1 was pretty good -- not KC level, but totally fine. Batch #2 really was KC level... just excellent--tender, juicy ribs, clean bones, very nice. Food heaven. Batch #3 was terrible -- dry meat, thick membrane, difficult to even cut into 3-rib chunks. There's no way what we received could have ever won an award from anyone.\n\nSo after spending about $165 here in the last three weeks, I can't recommend it. Hey, ribs ain't cheap (and that's fine), but it's hard to justify if the quality isn't even close. I realize there will always be slight variations...that's what makes BBQ great. But the incredible inconsistency here kills it for me."""
"1,""My previous review was for an oil change, which I still stand by.  This time I brought in my car because it was making a rattling noise.  I was told that the bracket holding my flex tube was broken and it would be around $350 to replace the whole pipe.  The pipe itself was not damaged and I asked if there was a cheaper option to attach the pipe back to the car (either by welding it or creating a new bracket). The mechanic gave me a rude answer about coat hangers.  \n\nI called around and was quoted $200 to replace the pipe at Speedys Muffler. When I brought it in there to get it replaced, they told me the pipe itself could just be bracketed to the car for $45. \n\nMake sure you call around before getting work done here in case there are other repair options that Chet's didn't consider."""

"1,""I hate giving 1-star reviews, but I'm not sure how else to rate the overall experience.\n\nThe Atlas Court location appears to be quite aged, extremely cramped, and lacks quality customer service. They do have a ton of equipment available, but that's about it.\n\nI arrived on Saturday morning with my reservation for a 17' truck firmly in-hand. There was a line of people waiting to check-in/check-out equipment, and only one person working behind the counter. \n\nThe employee (a younger gentleman) appeared to be struggling with everything he did, and he wasn't shy about hiding his frustrations. After waiting for around 15 minutes, another employee (I believe he's the manager) jumped-in and helped folks. The manager was much more proficient, helpful, and friendly. I was third or fourth in line, and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer.\n\nWhen I went to get my truck, there was an equipment problem, so they substituted another truck for me. Unfortunately, the truck that I was provided was ancient - it had 204,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, and it ran so poorly that I thought I was going to breakdown at several points along the way. The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time"
"1,""For all the hype, Michael's is quite a disappointment. \n\nMaybe it's because I didn't try the custard. But seriously, I didn't need more weighing down in this weather...so I ordered an orange crush float instead. For something that would have cost me MAYBE 50cents to make at home, I paid close to $5 for a 12oz cup. That is ridiculous. In general, I think their prices are pretty steep for what you get....you'd probably have to order a burger to really get a bang for your buck...\n\nLike RB, I also had an issue with the service. It was slow, disorganized, and not very friendly. The line was almost out the door, but the employees behind the counter didn't even ATTEMPT to speed up the service. One of them just disappeared into a back room. tsktsk. I also thought it was hilarious how one of the employees crumpled up an order form before the order had been completed, and then had to UNcrumple the paper so she could re-read the order to her coworker. Really? \n\nAnyway, I will probably give the Monroe St. Michael's - and their custards/burgers - a shot, but I'm not going to get my hopes up."""
"1,""Don't go to this store!  The service is always poor: the people working there are unfriendly, don't know what they are selling, where anything is located, and to top it off you are likely to be overcharged.

"2,""We recently bought a mid-century house and had no furniture for a couple of the rooms. We went to the Rubin's Clearance Center and happened to catch their moving sale, which meant that everything was marked down below their normal clearance price. Nice!

Real leather, real wood (for most items), etc. There are a few with scratches and dents, and many items are floor models, but for the most part, that doesn't bother me. We got a really good deal on a chair that apparently someone had ordered but came with the wrong fabric. We also left with a shelf/storage unit/drawer thing, a desk, and a rolling chair. The manager threw in a few gift-y items I had picked out, too. \n\nThe downside is, the salesperson (not the manager), kept reminding us that it was \""""20 minutes until closing time.\"""" This started a half hour before (believe me, I used to work in retail, and I know the \""""oh, you have a half hour before we close\"""" trick). We were out of there ten minutes before they closed, so it's not like we were making them stay late.

"1,""Horrible service, inedible food, tremendous swivel factor.

I asked for a minute with the menu, and spent the next 20 minutes trying to flag down a bartender to take my food order.\n\nOrdered the shrimp special which was not very special at all.  Although there were 6 grilled shrimp that were actually pretty good, the rest of the plate was a mess of flavorless, watery rice pilaf and a virtual stalk of broccoli, steamed but otherwise unadorned.  At $12.99 it was definitely not a good value.  Plus, it took for-ev-er to arrive. The gentleman next to me ordered the meatloaf special, and his cafeteria-style serving arrived in about 30 seconds.

"1,""We chose to go to Tully's II instead of going to one of our favorite places, Culvers.\nBig mistake.... Around 7:30 on a Friday night we walk in to the sign that says \""""Please Seat Yourself\"""".  So we walk through the Pool Table area to get to the back dining area, since it was close to the salad bar.  After searching for a highchair for my son, with no help from the waitress filling the salad bar right next to us, we all sit down at a table.  A few moments after sitting down a waitress (Older Woman) came to our table. She took our drink order: two waters with lemon, a Sierra Mist and a chocolate milk, and disappeared.  She reappeared with our drinks a few minutes later.  The waitress takes our orders, Two Cod Fish Frys and a Perch Fish Fry.  We were informed that the salad bar was included with our meal.  Well... From the time we walked into Tully's II to the time we left they were stocking the salad bar, which is not a large spread.  After 10 minutes of watching this woman stock the salad bar at a snails pace and a distasteful look on her face, we had to ask for silverware and plates. Apparently the woman stocking it didn't seem to notice that they were all gone. I'm sure she thought it was nice that nobody was bothering her as she stocked the bar, not ever considering that nobody could eat from it even if they wanted to.  As my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up 20-25 minutes after placing our order.  Really? That long for a fish fry in Wisconsin?  Then came disappearing act two from our waitress!! The food consists of Heavily battered, greasy fish and tiny french fries.  No tartar sauce, no ketchup, no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar.  We had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce.  Another 20 minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order \""""All You Can Eat\"""" fish.  At this point we have watched 3 other waitresses continue to mess around with this Salad Bar, chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones, while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are.  One table had to go to the Salad Bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all. Our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order. Another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill... they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had.  We did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times (7 to be exact) to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen. But anything past those two ... it's like we didn't even exist. and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing. Finally, only after the man asked for his bill, did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish.  We mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point. We also asked for 3 Pieces of Perch, 4 pieces of baked Cod and a refill of Sierra Mist. Not too difficult to remember.  10 minutes later she comes to our table: 1 piece of Perch, 2 pieces of Cod, 3 pieces of  baked cod and no refill.  10 minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything, I immediately asked for our bill.  45 seconds later she returns with my card, the fastest thing this lady had done ALL night.  On our way out, we stopped to talk to a manager, briefly describing the WORST SERVICE we had ever had.  I paid first because I didn't want him to think we were trying to get anything free.  When we pointed out our waitress, he didn't look surprised.  All he had to say was \"""" I hope you come back and give us  another chance\"""", not \""""is there anything I can do to make it right?\"""" or \""""come back and have a meal on us\""""..... nothing.  We walked out utterly disgusted!!  The only reason Tully's II is getting one star is because there is no ZERO star option.  Would not...would not.... would not recommend this place to anyone.. EVER.

"1,""I have given this place multiple tries now and finally have decided to give it a proper review.\nGeneral Tso's is my go to dish for Chinese take out, an this place failed miserably on that! Nothing but over cooked chicken with a lot of sauce and breading and yucky skin. Yuck.\nThe lo mien was also horrible. There was just no flavor what so ever and nothing but noodles and what looked to be whatever mysterious vegetable they had lying around. \nIf I wanted to order leftover's I would order leftover's!\n\nThere saving grace is their hot sour soup. Very tasty. But...... I had one bad experience with it where I ordered a large to go and instead of telling me they only had enough for a small container, they put the left over/bottom of the pot in and filled it up only 3/4 of the way. Talk about shady service! I even watched them do it from behind the counter. Trying to pull a fast one on me. I think NOT!\n\nI'm still giving it a solid 2 stars because their egg rolls and ragoon were at least tasty too (other than the tasty soup, that is when they have it available).

"1,""I had not taken my family to RR in quite some time.  Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.\n\nOur entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.\n\nThe fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, \""""No, I already got this half full bowl.\""""\n\nA few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entr\u00e9e.\n\n$58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?

"2,""We have been going to Caring Hands with our dogs and cats for many years.

At 7 months old, our new puppy developed a serious bowel obstruction and required removal of 3 feet of his intestines and reattachment.  This was a complicated and risky surgery.  Because of Curt's supreme surgical skill, that dog is with us today at 4 years old, happy and loved.\n\nDr. Rebecca is also an outstanding vet, both in terms of skill and caring feeling for animals and their human families.

You also have to consider the fact that Common Ground is a small, independent grocery store that has to have a higher margin in order to survive - and it tries its best to 'practice what it preaches' in it's business practices, from biodegradable, american-made produce bags to decent employee wages. All those little ethical steps cost money - and since the co-op is community owned, ultimately the money you spend there is going back into the community, rather than in some corrupt CEO's pocket, and that's always a good thing.\n\nApart from my price-justification rant, this is the most awesome grocery store in town.

Who the hell are these librarians to tell people how they need to sit or wear their shoes? \nAnd the children's librarians are not friendly or nice with the kids, but generally seem annoyed that anyone is even there. I thought that was the point of a library?

They offer very fresh seafood. Other items that were offered bananna blossom in brine, canned jack fruit, pickled caggage, bamboo shoots, quail eggs, fried gluten, dried lotus seeds and a variety of exotic teas. If you are looking for a more authentic selection of fresh foods, this is likely your best bet.

I took the dog to my vet first thing monday morning and the first thing she said was the dog had a good chance of having a serious kidney infection and may respond to treatment.  Isn't that what I asked!  After 5 days of antibiotic treatment the dog is brand new and back to normal.  I can't say enough about my vet, she is awesome and thorough.

The room smelled very weird (that smell that makes you think someone could have died in there but they used enough chemicals to kill every last skin cell), the bedding was very itchy, and the shower curtain didn't even have any plastic liner to keep the water in the tub. The only positives (the reason it gets two stars instead of one) were that there was good pressure in the shower and the location was not bad. Honestly though, unless it is a crazy deal like we had, there are better hotels in the area. There is even a nicer Super 8 near Lincoln Avenue."""

"1,""Today is St. Joseph's Day, a day that in Italy and many traditional Italian-American households is as special as St. Patrick's Day is to the Irish, and a day rich in food rituals.  To mark the occasion, I decided that after work I would have a multi-course dinner at one of Champaign-Urbana's \""""Italian\"""" restaurants.  Let me first preface my review with some background.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, in a traditional Italian-American household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the \""""sacra tavola\"""" or sacred table.  I dined in restaurants in Little Italy and Brooklyn where the wait staff was fresh \""""off the boats\"""" and barely spoke English and the owners and chefs were all old school Italians who had menus often hand-written and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a sense of tradition in the entire dining experience.  Their tables were often occupied by members of \""""La Famiglia\"""" but we won't go there.  I have no such high expectations from the local \""""Eye-talian\"""" businesses.  Anyway, I decided upon The Great Impostor , er, Impasta.  The d\u00e9cor bordered on tacky, with prints of Italian posters taped to the sides of the booths.  Tape?  Really?  Service was slow and perfunctory.  The meal started with bread, olive oil, and cheese for the dipping.  The oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not Parmigiano Reggiano.  I ordered a glass of the house Chianti, which was drinkable.  For my appetizer, I chose the Sausage in Crust.  The sausage was unremarkable and under-seasoned and the crust was bone dry.  The small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp.  My main course was the Linguini Pescatore, described as clams, mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini.  The mussels were borderline, the shrimp decently done, and the clams of questionable origin.  The sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual \""""fare la scarpetta\"""", which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread.  The olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can.  The linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork.  I indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday.  As expected, no Sfinge de San Giuseppe, a traditional pastry, on the menu, so I opted for the Tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of Sambuca.   The latter was fine, the former was nothing special.  Perhaps this seems a harsh review.  Many people may like the \""""Eye-talian\"""" food offered in C-U's restaurants, likely because that is what they are accustomed to.  I like some of the Mexican and Chinese food here but I'm sure that Mexicans and Chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards.  So it is with ethnic cuisine.  A lot just depends upon what you are used to."""

I chose the Dark and Stormy, which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it! (I ended up having another that I really didn't need, just because it was so refreshingly awesome.) Unfortunately Radio Maria's website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that I went here on a trip out to Des Moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had, but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average. I'd definitely return here on a trip to the Twin City area."""
"2,""I have always enjoyed myself here. I've dined and drank and drank and drank.\n\nA few highlights of Radio are: 1) their Absinthe service, which is quite a production. I don't feel like I can really do it justice by describing it, but you will not be disappointed if you order up a couple Absinthe drinks. 2) They offer \""""The Wheel\"""", which is a 3.5 oz shot of each of their beers on tap. They have about 28 beers on tap, and many are the darker craft ales, which in addition to being really tasty, are higher in proof. You need a couple of people to do this right, and there are some \""""rules\"""", but if you are already planning on cabbing it home, this is a great way to learn about beer and get drunked. 3) Their kitchen stays open all night.

"1,""So Domino's is Domino's, right?  You must know what you are getting--I don't have to tell you the pizza, breadsticks, chicken strips, pretty good in terms of getting what you pay for.  However, this location gets the unfortunate privilege  of being my neighborhood locations (less than a mile from my house), and although this location has been prompt and delicious, this is more a review about the man himself, Mr. Domino and my online ordering experiences with him.\n\nMy friends, why would you spend $17 on a Domino's pizza when Papa John's will give it to you for $11?.  Not to say I'm a broke hobo, but seriously, the difference in cost is a draft beer at a classy joint and 2 at the places I frequent.  My biggest irk with Domino's is that they advertise $11.99 Any Speciality Pizza and if you change 1 item, say you don't like mushrooms (not saying that's me, could be, not saying) and trade for something like black olives (even trade, no?  Sometimes I even end up with less on the pizza because I don't like meats all that much and substitute veggies).  So if you change 1 item instead of their $11.99 advertised special, all of a sudden the price is $16.99?  $5 for some f''in black olives?  Seriously.  I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!

How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use.

Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment.

"2,""typically i'm not a huge fan of artifact and cultural exhibits.  However, the Heard experience was beyond expectations.

"1,""I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.\n\nYes, Majerle's is worse.  \n\nOkay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.\n\nThe set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.  \n\nMoreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.  \n\nThe bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.\n\nI wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US."""
"1,""I really want to love this place, but I can't. The fries are great, the servers attractive and the food gets there fast, but the entrees aren't that great, bottle beer is $4 (that much for a miller lite at a sports bar? really?) and the servers, for whatever stupid, dumbass reason, refuse to split checks.\n\nThis does nothing but piss me off. I've never understood this practice. First of all, you're a sports bar. People genuinely come into sports bars in groups. We all ordered food, we all ordered drinks and it took nearly 25 minutes to figure out our goddamn bill at the end.\n\nAttention restaurant owners: MOST OF US DON'T CARRY CASH ANYMORE. Get with it and start splitting checks or train your servers to do that with large groups. There is no reason to make things more difficult for customers and servers will get better tips."""

"1,""First time at Majerle's with three others. We went before the Rattlers playoff game but after a D-Backs game, so it was really hopping in there.

It had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing. Her husband got the Rojo Diablo sandwich. He said it was 'stringy' and didn't finish it. My wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a 'lettuce bun'. She got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce. I got the All-Star burger. It was good but overcooked by two levels. \n\nThe fries and sweet potato fries were good, as was the selection of drinks. All told, for three sandwiches, a salad and six beers it totaled $85.

"2,""I booked a stay at Hotel San Carlos for one night through Groupon for $76 after taxes. Most other hotels in the area go for $120-300, so finding this deal was awesome. My boyfriend and I live in AZ and he wanted to celebrate his birthday by having a staycation downtown so we could have fun with family and friends without worrying about a way to get home at the end of the night. Originally, we were going to book a night at Hotel Palomar but like I said, we weren't looking to spend a lot of money.\n\nI started reading reviews before we checked in and was feeling nervous that I hadn't made a good decision because there were more bad than good things being said. From the moment we got to the hotel to the time we checked out, our stay was anything from dissappointing. The staff was nice and let us check In early. Before we parked we talked to the valet service and asked for advice on parking. They could have given us excuses to use their service but instead, they pointed across the street and let us know that on the weekends, parking in those spots were free. Awesome! Free parking. \n\nOnce we got to our room, everything was clean and the room was a nice temperature. The rooms are small and the bathroom is even smaller but I didn't expect anything else. Its a little ridiculous how many people complained about the raised up part of the floor you have to step over to get in the shower. Wahhh. I barely noticed it, and anyone with a brain should have no problems stepping over it. Also, the shower does fluctuate in temperature when someone flushes a toilet, but it was never an unbearable cold or heat. Once we got settled in we went to the pool, its a cute little pool but by the time we got out there the sun was covered by the building surrounding it, so that was a bummer. \n\nFor lunch, we went next door to McCaffery's. They have great food and our bartender was great. \n\nHonestly, I have no complaints about our stay. Its a cute little hotel and for staying on a Saturday night, there were no dramatic noises going on and I didn't hear anyone talking in another room, having sex, or going to the bathroom. I heard a couple of door slams but I think at any hotel its typical. All the bad reviews are obviously from people who have a case of first world problems. Wahhh, \""""no room service\"""", Wahhh \""""the rooms are too small\"""", Wahhh \""""I couldn't control the room temperature\"""", Wahhh \""""there's something I have to lift my foot up 5 inches from the ground to get over in to the shower\"""", Wahhh,  Wahhh,  Wahhh.

"1,""I have been going to this IHOP every month for 4 years. Our group is anywhere from 8 to 25. There are only two places in the restaurant that accommodate groups and for the most part, we have been seated relatively quickly. Over the past year, service has gone down hill. It started taking forever to get our order taken, get our drinks, or get our food. We are a very forgiving bunch and know it's not easy to serve a large group but as service started really sliding, our last trip ended the relationship. We had about 20 people and knew we would have to wait a bit, but after 30 minutes, we inquired how long and it was like \""""your waiting for a table?\""""the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups. How can you not remember a group when they take up the whole lobby? We called a near by breakfast place and they were thrilled to have our party, which grew smaller since some left at that point. We found a new home and they will get 5 stars on my review."""
"2,""What can I say about Comedor that hasn't already been said... The food is reasonably priced and the selection is huge.

"2,""yum! this place is yummy! it is my favorite authentic mexican restaurant to take out-of-towners to. the doorman/security guard is so sweet and makes sure you don't get shot and that your car is there after your meal. the surrounding area is a bit tough, and i don't suggest wandering far from the parking lot if you know what i mean. the somewhat scary location makes everything a bit more authentic in my eyes.\n\ni made the mistake of ordering chicken once, and i was disappointed. not sure why ... maybe it is because they don't use all white meat chicken. or maybe it was an off day. or maybe i just don't like their chicken. i don't know. but now i stick with beef or cheese based items and everything i get is super delish. love the beans! they do 'em right. margaritas are freshly made and full of alcohol, not like the watered down versions you get from a stupid machine at other places. gotta love the free chips and salsa ... the salsa always tastes fresh, and they'll give you a super-spicy version if you ask. and they keep 'em coming, even after dinner if you want more.  try the carne asada cheese crisp as an appetizer ... it is huge, but so good that if you have more than 4 people at your table you should order two. if you don't someone's going to wish they had gotten more."""

"2,""I went to see In the Wake of Bounty (part of Fringe Fest 2011) and besides the show being exquisite, the venue was perfect.

The theatre is really intimate with a small stage and limited seating. With that being said... any seat would give a great view of the happenings on stage.  Only downside is that the theatre chairs and my rear end did not get along amiably.  Lots of fidgeting on my part and constant readjusting."""

"1,""Awful.  Gross.  Disappointing.\n\nA co-worker and I weren't in the mood for Subway, McDonald's, or Einstein's, so we decided to try Chico's Tacos - a place I'd driven by many times but hadn't tried before.  The items on the menu looked decent enough, and I settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go.\n\nI got back to work and settled in to try my meal.  The tacos were actually not in pre-formed taco shells, but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried.  Sadly, there was hardly any meat in either, and most of each taco was the shell.  They had good flavor, but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam plate below sort of ruined them.  The beans and ride were both inedible.  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor, with a layer or congealed cheese over the top.  The rice was mushy and bland, except for the top-most layer, which was over-seasoned with cumin.  I was given a small bag of tortilla chips, and those were passable.  Including a large fountain drink, I paid $10.62.\n\nI won't be back, especially when there's a Filibertos just down the road."""
"2,""This place is really great for teriyaki.  In fact it is really the only place worth going for teriyaki.  First of all - it is really very inexpensive (lunch for two under 20 - easily). Second of all - the service is great because it is family run - you see the same people there everytime.  The food is really good - and just hits the spot when you have a hankering for teriyaki.  My only complaint would be the hours- bums me out when I want teriyaki for dinner and they are already closed."""
"1,""I stopped in one day when I first moved here and sampled a couple of things, the chicken teriyaki, the fried gyoza, and some kind of drink.

The women who helped me was super friendly and made suggestions of things I should try on my next visit (when pigs fly). I am really amazed by the positive reviews here. Unfortunately, this place is just a couple blocks from my house so I have to deal with the nasty stench from their deep fryer when I walk to the lightrail on my way to work."""

There food is also really good for what i take as more of a bar enviornment. There burgers, sandwiches and pastas are all well executed and have a gourmet flair with resonable prices.

We watched our waitress eat her lunch at the bar. And then when our food came it wasn't right.\n\nWe ordered a sandwich that was piled high with turkey. One bite, however, and we knew our bread was more than day-old. I actually had to ask them if it was toasted (it wasn't) because it was just as hard and dry as a piece of toasted bread. Back it went.\n\nThe pizza which I ordered because of the Kalamata Olives (their \""""Mediteranean\"""") was missing Kalamata Olives. That's right -- it's the major ingredient on the pie and the joker in the kitchen forgot to put them on. \n\nNever mind, after 45 minutes you'll eat anything. Beer was overpriced at $5 for a glass.

"1,""The lobster bisque is amazing I do agree, however anything above and beyond the bar takes acts of congress to get right.. the server took it upon himself to assume I wanted a side portion instead of a dinner portion of a salad at dinner time (weird).

"1,""I've hesitated to write about Fate. I always enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon, even back when it was on University. I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.\n\nWe've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it. \n\nI'm not really high on the \""""this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time\"""" style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco. \n\nI don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.\n\nThe server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.\n\nAnyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- \""""the food here is terrible... and such small portions!\""""\n\nI'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us. \n\nAnyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough. Oh, if you're uncomfortable with IKEA furnishings (I'm fine), don't even try it."""

Personalized service like hers helped me to overlook issues like the significant cleanliness challenges that are easy to spot if you look around.   If you think I am joking go into the bar and look up a the light fixtures.   That fuzzy stuff is probably 10+ years of dust.  Carpets are dingy and smells like old beer.  This place rocks as a nightclub on weekends I dont think that cleanliness is the priority......anyhow....I spent a lot of money there over the years, mainly for lunch or after work cocktails with friends.  Never more..... not because of the issues outlined above, but it is beacuse how I was treated when visiting the establishment not long ago.   Pamela was not working that day (sadly) and the male bartender decided that he was more interested in lecturing me on his beliefs than he was in serving my drinks and taking my money.  He had an issue, and apparently I was the target and cause of his rantings.   He was sad about the lack of customers and decided it was my fault as I mentioned I worked downtown.   His rants about downtown businesses was unorthodox and uncalled for.   I drank my beer and hurried out reminding myself never to set foot in the place again.

The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   So far, a good dining experience.\n\nThen the bill arrives.  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.

The hostess staff was rude and had to get the manager involved. My kids did not like to food at all and they love spaghetti and meatballs. Food did not come out hot at all. The food was also average nothing special about it. I would not recommend this place and will not be coming back."""
"1,""Used a Groupon special for the Murder Mystery evening with tickets to the show and dinner. The Murder Mystery show was in a room about 20 x 30 feet with 50 people crowded into this space. The volume of the music and announcements were so loud, we couldn't even talk to half the people at out table! They took our drink order and we didn't see it until half an hour later. The food was HORRIBLE! How can you ruin a spaghetti dinner??First of all, it was cold! Cold spaghetti !! Hardly any sauce! The house salad was taken out of a plastic bag and dumped into a bowl....at an Italian place, they served the salad with only ranch dressing ..... Not even Italian! And no choices offered.  Our party of four will NOT go back. At least 10 others felt the same way."""
"1,""Close to work yet I think I will keep walking.  I've been there for breakfast and lunch and it's ok.  I tried their spicy peanut slaw, and all you can taste is sriracha and nothing else, bleh!  I couldn't eat it, it was not flavorful just a burning heat. Sandwiches are ok, nothing to really jump and down about."""
"1,""I wish this place were better! The only redeeming factor about this place is the happy hour. I went here yesterday just after the lunch hour and the service and food were both below average. Don't get me wrong, the hostesses were nice... when they were actually around.\n\nI had the veggie burger and my friend had the beef brisket with bourbon sauce. Generally I find that if the veggie burger is good, the normal is bad and vise versa. However, both were terrible. My veggie burger had a terrible mush consistency and the quality of the bun was awful. My friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless. \n\nFor the price I would expect better food... much better food. \n\nHonestly, they should get rid of the tables and add more beer taps. Quit the food, up the drinks."""
"1,""I have to say, I was extremely disappointed when stopping in for lunch today.  My husband raved about Tom's lunch he had several months ago.  He said they had \""""killer\"""" potato salad and a chili-mac-and-cheese you'd never find anywhere.\n\nThe 2 of us ordered"
"2,""Stumbled on this place while sight seeing on a long lay over in Phoenix. The food was moderately priced and service was quick. The waiter was pleasant. For being downtown the place was very quiet. In fact, the whole of downtown was quiet."""
"2,""This has been my car wash since I lived in midtown off 3rd street and Thomas. They do a great job, and are very accommodating if they miss a spot. They tend to be somewhat expensive, but then again they are not scratching your car with machines. I used to get the side wash with my Audi because of some modifactions that kept it from being on the rails, and for $15 you couldn't get a better wash in town. \n\nI don't recommend their detail service, as they are not very complete, but for car washes A+"""
"1,""I had really high hopes, and I was thrilled that it's so close to my house... However I soon started second guessing myself after pulling up. I was there before anyone else and watched the attendant avoid my car and instead go to the 2 old guys in expensive sport cars that showed up 2 or so minutes after me, and she even waited a little longer after that like she was hoping another car would pull up. When one didn't, she finally came to my car (and her attitude sucked on top of it). It's not like I own a nasty beat up car either, it's a newer Mitsubishi. After telling her I wanted a full interior detail and an exterior wash I went inside and sat around for a few hours. When it was finally done, I got what I expected, a nice, shiny, clean car.. with a soaking wet interior. Granted, I've never had an interior detail before, but I didn't expect everything to be sopping wet regardless of that. They actually put down a plastic cover over my seat for me, but since I had to stop at some place afterwards I accidently ripped it and then had to ride around with a wet bottom. I was told to keep the windows cracked an inch or 2, and did the whole weekend, however now my car kinda stinks and I'm going to be pissed if theres mold or mildew factoring into that. I'm not happy, and I'm not going back either. I'm giving them 2 stars because they did what I asked them to do: they cleaned my car.\n\nP.S. I work at an insurance company. I spoke to an appraiser and found out that places should really be doing a dry shampoo to avoid screwing up the foam bits they have under your carpets and inside your seat."""
"1,""This place is way overrated!!! They let ur car sit for 5-10 minutes before they even start to dry it.  By this time the water spots are already dry and they miss spots in the front or sides all the time.  Their armor all has gone down as well.  They used to have the best tire gloss that would last for 10 days, now they use a cheaper brand that's dull.  This place has really gone down over the years.  Again, way overrated.  30 second vacuum pfffff"""

"1,""I don't know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla?

I've only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just don't get anything greek about this place."""
"1,""Hard Rock Cafe is a cool place to go if you're in the area and want to kill time before a concert or a game, but destination bar it's not. The food is average and the drinks aren't anything out of the ordinary. Infact, there's nothing really unique about the Hard Rock aside from the fact that they jacked up the prices because you're dining and/or drinking at the HARD ROCK CAFE. \n\nI'm disappointed that it doesn't compare to others around the world and seems out of place in Phoenix. A Hard Rock Scottsdale would be way cooler."""
"1,""Long lines before/after sporting events. Limited beer selection. Mediocre food. I wasn't impressed. I can't tell you how many times I thought it would be a good idea to stop in for a drink or snack while in the area, only to find out that a baseball or basketball game was scheduled down the street and the wait would be an hour or longer. Not worth the wait."""
"1,""I've been to this McDonald's twice, one month apart, and I've had the same experience twice.\n\nThe hash browns are gross. They taste like they've been fried in old, burned, rotted oil. This is the only McDonald's I've ever been to that's had foul tasting hash browns.\n\nBoth times I've sat inside and both times I've overheard the same bitching several times over... .the manager having to continually tell a male employee (not kidding around), \""""stop being mean to the customers\"""" and \""""be nice!\"""""""
"2,""I enjoyed the Arizona Ultimate Women's Expo.  It was something that of course was geared towards women, but I saw several men there as well.  I must have entered at least 15 drawings.  Deidre Hall was great.  It's an even better time if you can get a few girlfriends to go with you.  There were 4 different stations for alcohol samples.  Some of them were good some not so much, like the Senorita Limonita.  That was horrible.  If anyone plans on going in the future, plan ahead.  I totally didn't even think about the Diamondbacks playing.  I had to drive a little bit further for parking, which was worth it.  It only cost me $5, whereas every other lot or garage I saw, was $15 or $20.  Also, take your time when walking through the expo.  There's so much to see and do.  Find out when the keynote speakers go on and when demos are, so that you can get the most out of it."""
"2,""One of my favorite veggie sandwiches ever!  The sandwich is called \""""Where's the Beef?\"""" and any menu planner / company owner with a sense of humor is A-OK in my book!  Comes with tomatoes, celery, sprouts, lettuce, avocados, cucumbers, jicama, and pinenuts.  I recommend adding spicy mustard and havarti cheese.\n\nGreat place for a downtown lunch.  There are lots of places that do sadwiches.  I go to Jacquees for good Boar's Head meat, I go to Sticklers for the delicious fresh bread, and I go to D&D for the unique hot and signature sandwiches on their menu.  Soups change daily, as does a flavored tea, staff is hit or miss on friendliness.\n\nToday I got to try the Buffalo Chicken Soup and was impressed! Then again, how can you go wrong with a creamy chicken soup with that tangy, spicy buffalo flavor? The good news: I could probably eat 3 bowls. The bad news: I could probably eat 3 bowls. Calorie counters - stay away from this soup!\n\nD&D can get very busy around noon, along with many of the downtown places.  I suggest calling in your order if you don't want to wait -OR- you can even use their website to order online.  Cool!!"""
"1,""Been trying for 30 mins on and off to order a delivery. I get voice mail and nothing else."""

Today when I returned, the guy at the counter asks, \""""With onions and mushrooms?\"""" Okay, yeah. \""""Sweet or spicy peppers?\"""" Spicy, please. And what I received knocked the socks off that earlier sandwich. \n\nThis place is tiny, cramped, a bit chaotic and is apparently cooled by wall-mounted fans. Yet I can see myself going here on a regular basis. So, the next time you're having one of those moments, like Ameerah A, opt for the cheese steak. Just be sure to let me know before hand so we can meet up."""

Three days later the shellac cracked and began to peel. I called the salon and they asked I return and have the shellac redone. I did and the following day the shellac was cracking and peeling. This has never happened to me with any shellac or other type of gels. This was a waste of money and especially time!!"""
"2,""Not sure why this location has received so many bad reviews! I used to work directly across the street from this location and would go here for lunch AT LEAST 2 times a week.

I compare all schlotzky's to this one, and most fail in comparison.  My favorite sandwich to this day is the Albuquerque Turkey with lots of their hot sauce... now my mouth is watering... As far as \""""poor choice of sides\"""" go, good luck finding a franchise sandwich shop that serves fries! I prefer chips with my sandwich anyways... anyhoo.. if you are in the area around lunch time be prepared for a line, but it goes quick! :)"""

"1,""I'm glad I had a Deal Chicken deal because the food was just ehhh. \n\nWith my credit of $24 and a few extra dollars, I ordered a full rack of pork ribs which included two sides (I chose collared greens & sweet potato fries-- small upcharge that I was not informed of), 1/2lb of hot links and a few free dinner buns. \n\nThe ribs were fairly good (3 stars) albeit a bit dry-- I guess that's why they drown it in BBQ sauce. The hot links however were dissssgusting. (0 stars). Just thinking about it makes me want to puke. It was so soft, I quickly tossed out the serving that was on my plate and what was left in the container. They are what I imagine vienna sausages would taste like (but spicy, of course). \n\nCollared greens & sweet potato fries were edible.. not cringeworthy (like the hot links), but not worth the calories/stomach space either. \n\nService was friendly & efficient. \n\nWarning: be prepared to swat flies if you dine in.

The clerk seemed like it was a pain for him to answer some questions about the food that is keeping him employed. \n\nFood: It was ok. Not great, just okay. There wasn't anything that screamed \""""Have seconds!\"""" The sauce is decent. Nothing spectacular. \n\nOverall, it was a 2 because nothing blew me away.

He asked how the chicken was when he was bringing in the chairs from outside and we said the same,  still pink and bleeding. All he said was oh okay and walked away. I didn't even eat my sandwich because if they couldn't cook chicken right why should I trust them to cook the pork correctly? When I went to the front to talk with them they all disappeared.

"1,""First time here.  I'll give credit where it's due, they have apparently been reading the reviews because the staff made an extra effort to be friendly and courteous. \n\nI had 2 bbq beef sandwiches because they were out of the pulled pork.  While eating my sandwiches I had the thought there should be laws enacted to constitute what restaurants can call bbq.  Boiled meat covered in BBQ sauce is NOT BBQ.  \nI grew up in the South, I've been to Memphis in May a couple of times, so my standards for BBQ are admittedly higher than average, but this was not even close to real BBQ.\n\nWas it decent food.  Sure.  Decent, at best.  Was it the reason I got an upset stomach a couple hours later, possibly.   I don't care about the old decor, dirty looking bathrooms or anything else, if the food was good I would go back.  It wasn't."""
"1,""As you might be able to tell from my schizophrenicly changing stars for this place, my experiences have varied.  Some things that do not ever change, with my latest experience in parentheses:\n-They seem to carry only the tastiest wines.  (Pascual Toso Reserve Malbec '08)\n-Their cheeses are also amazingly amazing.  (American Plate w/ Buzzed from Utah and a perfectly aged Gouda)\n-Their food is great.  (Lasagna)\n\nHowever,\n-The kitchen ran out of pizza, mac&cheese (which is what i wanted), and lasagna (luckily i made the cut).  That's easily half their menu!  We subsequently had to change our orders twice as the bad news kept rolling in.  By the end of the night our poor server was like the Angel of Death since each time I saw him I got nervous that he was going to come tell me that whatever it was I had ordered was yet again 86ed.\n-Then the food that we WERE able to order took over 45 minutes to show up.\n-Then the Reverse Happy Hour cocktails were inconsistent (different colored Pomegranate Margaritas, one Pineapple Cosmo that tasted great, but a 2nd that had a coffee flavor - which they gladly replaced for a good tasting one).\n\nOverall I ended up paying WAY too much for a lackluster experience.  What really peeved me off was that I had recommended this place to our party of 14, with the hope that I could show them how awesome places in CenPho are, since they're all suburbanites.\n\nSo thank you Cheuvront, for making me look like a fool and giving my friends one more reason to stay in the 'burbs  :("""
"2,""Decided to take a short trip downtown to try the Central Coast Wine Tasting event held here last week.  We had a blast!

That only made us want to try more!  \n\nJeannie loves scallops, so naturally she ordered the Scallop Martini.  I know deep down she did not want to share, but she graciously fed me one of those monsters.  She said they are the best she has ever had and I have a hard time arguing with her.  Three big, tender, perfectly cooked and seasoned scallops resting in a Martini glass.  The accompanying sauce was absolutely delicious.

"1,""I've driven past this place many times on the way to Suns or D-Backs games.  Every time I passed by, it looked like a fun place to go hang out.  I finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown Phoenix.  One of the companies at the conference hosted a party here.\n\nThe party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant.  The company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary Cigars, so I understand why they had it outdoors.  The weather was perfect, so it was a good time of the year to do it.  The place was packed too.  So why the 2 Stars?  Here's why:\n\n- They serve Wine out of a liquor gun....yes, they do.  When I went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of Cabernet, the bartender told me \""""You have to go inside because we don't have the handles with the Wine\"""".....I thought she was kidding and I said, \""""I'm sorry, I don't think you understand, I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  You don't have any bottles back there?\""""....that's when she confirmed what I heard and said \""""No, you heard me right, we serve Wine out of a handle/line and since we're a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get it\"""".......what the hell?!  The Wine tasted like what you would expect Wine from a tap to taste like...\n\n- The restrooms are like gas station restrooms.  They're located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that they're too small and dirty.  They couldn't handle the crowd of people at the party.\n\n- Service is slow.  The line at the bar was 30 people deep for each line (2 lines).  There were only 2 bartenders to service 200+ people.  It took 20+ min to get a drink.\n\n- The party felt like a house party in someone's backyard.  Plastic cups, plastic furniture, you had to bus your own table.....there were no buspersons or anyone to clean up.  Bizzaro-world.....\n\nOverall, not a good experience.  Maybe if I was a young 20 yr old it would be cool...not now.\n\nReturn Factor - 5%"""
"2,""We took our in-laws here while they were visiting from out of state. This was on their to do list of local experiences. It was also my first time here since moving to the valley. Nobody was disappointed.\n   We came for lunch on a Thursday around noon. We were able to get metered parking right in front of the place. There is a lot in back that charges $5.00 as well.They were about 30% full. We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress immediately. They brought a highchair for the baby too.\n   I loved the d\u00e9cor. Classic rock and roll memorabilia was the theme. Many of Alice Cooper's own items decorated the wall from tour posters to guitars. There were several large screen TVs and classic rock and roll music was playing as well. The waitresses were dresses in attire that also supported the theme.\n   The menu feature's items with a celebrity theme. I ordered the \""""Adam Richman's bases loaded big unit\"""" and a local micro brew. The food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time. This was a 1 lb., 22\"""" loaded hotdog with a good order of fries. The hot dog was an all beef hotdog on a bun loaded with sauerkraut, \""""nightmare\"""" chili, onions, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and shredded cheddar cheese. It was more than I could hope to eat, but I did do serious damage. After I got a to go box, we browsed the gift shop. Everything Alice was available.\n  This place isn't for everybody who is not into the genre. We did enjoy it and will return on special occasions. If you go make it a week day for lunch. It's probably when you'll get best for service. They are located near Chase Field, so they are probably packed on game day. The menu is a little pricy, but worth the experience."""

"2,""Harsh to say, but I hate arenas. The only time I go is to see s concert, show or special event as I'm not an arena-type sports fan. Last night's event was Cirque du Soleil's Michael Jackson-The Immortal Tour. I have to say as far as arenas go, the US Airways Center is pretty amazing.  Entering and exiting are easy-peasy. It didn't feel overly crowded and parking was plentiful in outdoor lots or the adjacent indoor multi-story connected building.  \n\nThere's a Starbucks on site, which was like heaven to me . . . I wanted a nice hot tea to savor through the show, There are other well-known food concessions throughout the arena, as well as some fairly comfortable seating areas to pass the time until the powers that be allow you to go to your seat.\n\nSince we were sitting in Section 102, first row, we were in the makeshift seats (the same as they put on the floor, foldables with no real back support.

"2,""Tickets to Phoenix Suns games are cheaper than the large beer in a cup at the arena. $10 tickets and $10.50 brews. I used to watch this arena on TV for years when the Suns were good and I was living elsewhere. It seems less orange in person, maybe some of the seats should be painted orange too. If you know the area, you will know not too pay for parking either. After 5pm, meters are free and obviously on the Sunday I went no charge. Try parking at 5th and monroe street. Inside the arena is pretty nice, I had a great view from the upper deck, but cmon Suns, do you really need ushers kicking people out of upper level seats. Give somebody a tiny bit of power and see what they do with it. Of course, I'm stealthy and uncatchable, so no senior citizen usher is telling me where to sit. Anyway, my team, the Brooklyn Nets won and overall a good, no hassle experience. If the Suns ever get good again, it will be worse to attend. Oh yeah, good entertainment also at least on this day. It was the gorilla's birthday and a ton of mascots were there celebrating and also the trampoline dunkers were cool and the 8 year-old girl who sang the anthem was top notch."""

The walls are stark white and look like those cheap walls people use to divide up apartments into more bedrooms.  There were no decorations or paintings on the wall when I went even though I thought it was supposed to be some sort of gallery.  Maybe I went on a night that they were between showings.  The space is small, but if they hired a better interior designer they could have made it work.  Unforch, it didn't.

"2,""We had to be near downtown today, and when scrolling through nearby restaurants on my phone I saw this one.  On Google it's rated 5 stars.  Here it's 4 stars.  And only a single dollar sign!  So we drove over.\n\nThe place looks like something you might find in Mexico.  No hostess.  Walk up to the counter, order your food, wait for your number to be called, walk into the dining area (ducking under a low arch if you over 6' tall) where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs.  Seriously...if you didn't know you were in Phoenix you'd swear you were in an eatery in Mexico.  They also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter.\n\nOn to the actual food.  As this was my first time here I ordered the chimi.  I usually do that so I have a basis for comparison to other places.  My wife had the albondigas soup.  We both liked our dishes.  The chimi was done perfectly.  A light crunch of the shell.  Not overcooked, not greasy.  The chicken was moist and tender.  And it was a pretty big chimi.  I think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  The pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.  And the Mexican rice was very nice.\n\nI wish it wasn't so far from home (Gilbert) because I'd love to make this my \""""regular\"""" spot for Mexican food.  I would say it blows away just about every place else I've found in the Valley, and is neck-and-neck with Guerrero's (in Tempe).  I can't choose between the two at this moment.\n\nI hope to return here, and will be trying something different.  Their menu is pretty extensive with several traditional dishes (including menudo, lengua, and albondigas)."""

"1,""Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?\n\nA few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.\n\nThe fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \n\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge."""

A minute after my soup\nwas served, my main course came out.  It had two items--pea pods and pork.  Not very BBQ flavor, rather a funny flavor.

"1,""What's your opinion of an MD who wears a three piece suit?  When I see a doctor wearing a three piece suit, the first thing that comes to my mind is, why is he wearing a suit?  Did he wear a suit to class in med school?  Did he wear a suit doing rounds during residency?  I know lawyers and investment bankers wear suits, but doctors?  I want to see my doctor in  a white coat.   Who wears a suit if they don't have to?  Am I obsessed with what people wear?  Not normally, but when an MD dresses in a suit, then I can't stop wondering why...  You get the picture.  To me, there's something not right about a doctor under the age of seventy wearing a suit.  I could spend this review just commenting about workplace attire, but I need to move on.\n\nDr Stevens performs surgery at HIS surgery center - YIKES!   I hate doctors who have a business in addition to their practice.  They see patients in the office, they do surgery at THEIR surgery center. There's a conflict of interest here:  is it possible that patients who may not need surgery are scheduled for a procedure to pay for all that expensive equipment.  I HATE INCORPORATED DOCTORS!! The Gucci loafers.  The conferences in New York, Anaheim, Orlando, Miami, etc.  Making $200K  from a regular practice isn't enough?  Are you a doctor or a businessman?   What's more important:  helping the sick or your bottom line (like I want a new boat that costs $260,000 and the down payment is $26,000 so I need to get 23 surgeries done in the next 3 weeks to get that payment together).  If I want you to do my surgery at the Mayo Clinic is this possible?   I want to have surgery at a hospital.  Because, let's say something goes wrong.  Drastically wrong, like I stop breathing.  When this happens in a hospital they call code blue and every available doctor and nurse runs as fast as they can and does their best to get you breathing again.  In a surgery center there may not be any other doctors and there may not even be a nurse.  People die in surgery centers.    When I hear surgery center, I think of people getting liposuction and dying from blood loss in the recovery room because the doctor left and no trained medical staff are available.  \nDr Stevens is arrogant:   i was extremely ill when I had a consultation with him. I had quite a few questions to ask about my situation.  Dr. Stevens kept writing and wouldn't look me in the eye when he deigned to answer my questions.  He kept looking at his notepad.  Damn it:  stop writing, lift up your head and look at me when I'm talking to you.  While I'm in the middle of this, it began to hit me that this was not the doctor for me.  I'm paying for the consultation, I could barely walk, it was June - so it was HOT outside.  I was exhausted, had been out of work for several weeks.  Was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon. He said he does the procedure i need all the time.  Maybe that was true, but he would NOT be doing this on me. As I was walking to the garage so I could collapse in my car, I was almost ready to give up.  I knew I had to go home, get on the internet and find a doctor that I liked.   I ended up  going with  Dr. Mark Lyons, a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic."""

"1,""It had been years since I had been back to Rito's, I was craving it for lunch and thought let's do an old school affordable lunch.  I typically eat Burrito's at the Lunch Trucks so I thought Rito's being in the middle of the hood, nothing fancy, outdoor seating and so on should be a quick affordable quick lunch for two of us.  We got our Two Burrito's after waiting almost 30 minutes in their lobby + the 10+ we spent in line? (I know I know...what did I expect going there between 11am-1pm...but seriously they have all the ingredients made, it's just an assembly line, Chipotle Style dang it) so anyway, the food took way too long and $17.49 later for one green chile regular burrito and one red enchilada style burrito with rice and beans (in the hood) had me complaining about my planned 'cheap' lunch before I took my first bite.  \nI'm not gonna lie the burrito's are tasty and a good size, other comments mentioned salty and greasy and yes that is true on both, but that's why the place is famous for its simple salty/greasy food.  I have had better for the same or less $$ and for a much better atmosphere...that place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheap/vintage seating a sign a mural something...give the place a little character and I can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned $$ there.  Anyway not my most favorable review but I think Rito's has taken their fame to their head and caters to the foodies/downtown administrative crowd vs. the working class and neighborhood area peeps."""
"1,""I visit Phoenix frequently and this is my first stay at this location. The hotel is marginal, but needs some major updates. The breakfast is less than mediocre and seems like they are always low on supply. The last 2 mornings I arrived to find nothing but crumbs left for eggs. Lastly,  the customer service rep (I wont mention any names) who checked me in needed additional training on how to treat loyal customers. She was very rude and short during check in which I find uncommon for the brand."""
"1,""At 1 PM, we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices. Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.  \n\nEntrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.  \n\nIt's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt. \n\nJudging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back. Two stars for the ceviche."""
"2,""Magnifico!  Great little place tucked away in a semi-residential area of town.  Felt like I was part of the family after being seated.  Bright cheerful atmosphere like a fiesta!  Food was very flavoful even the white rice.  Crab enchiladas full of white crab meat and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce.  Salsa you get red (Spicy) and green (mild) with chips and I got a complimentary Cerviche.  The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just the right kick of heat.  Can't wait to try other dishes when I return to Phoenix in a couple of weeks!"""
"1,""I ate here 2 years ago and had one of the best meals. Not sure what changed, oh wait, it's the quality of the fish. I got the caldo de pescados. The sea bass was gross. So then they brought me a sea bass with ancho chiles that looked good but again, the fish was no bueno. I'm real sorry. I drove 30 minutes out of the way to come here and had 2 inedible entrees. \n\nCrab tostada, guacamole and margarita were ok but not worth the embarrassment of not eating 2 different dinners. The staff was super nice about it and the owner didn't charge me. I wanted to pay but he refused. So nice but I felt terrible. Bad dream."""
"2,""The Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, AZ is a great way to get a sample of Arizona's diverse and spectacular flora.  Check out The Gardens in the spring, when all of the plant and flowers are blooming in beautiful, vibrant colors.  This is a great place to take visiting relatives who love to garden or are just nature buffs.   It's an easy walking adventure with many cozy benches to sit and bird or nature watch.  Midway through the journey is a nice spot to enjoy a little refreshment and sample some yummy treats.  At the end of your journey is a great gift shop with books, jewelry and even plants found on the garden grounds for sale.  Visit when the day time temperatures are moderate and you're guaranteed to have an enjoyable time.  Be sure to wear sunscreen and bring a camera.  Don't forget to have fun!"""
"2,""When I want to go out but not spend $100 on entertainment and also get some exercise in at the same time and see some beautiful Arizona landscape, the Desert Botanical Gardens is the best place I can go. I enjoy walking around the Garden looking at all of the flowers in bloom and all of the different kinds of cactus. I also enjoy when they have different exhibits that you can see as you are wandering the garden. I really enjoyed the Chihuly Glass artwork that was displayed a few years back. \n\nProbably my favorite time of the year to come here is when they have the butterflies. They are so pretty and this year there were so many of them! We went this last weekend on my day off and the weather was perfect and we just had a great time. I also get to brush up on my photography skills here the best because I can take some amazing pictures of flowers and butterflies. \n\nIf you want to see what the Arizona desert is all about, you need to come here to experience it first hand. Its not only about dirt and cacti. There are flowers galore as well."""
"2,""At the DBG's for the first time ever a couple of months ago to check out the venue for my daughter's wedding. From the very beginning, Amber that young lady who worked with us was professional, on the ball and organized...far more than I can say about the wedding planner. I believe she must be the park's event coordinator and totally rocked it. \n\nThe place is truly beautiful, so different from what a \""""traditional\"""" garden looks like. Read the other reviews and the other folks will give you a much better idea of the type of plants, bugs, small animals, or as my granddaughter loudly proclaimed \"""" the birds with the hats!\"""" \n\nThere were four other wedding going on the afternoon (4/29/11) but we never really heard much except for some far away music. Signs were clearly posted leading the way to the wedding site *and the rehearsal the night before) and the restrooms were exceptionally clean and pleasant to use. \n\nThere was a very large room with shuttered windows and AC where my daughter and her wedding party dressed and a smaller, similar room where the groom and his group readied themselves. After the wedding, as the chairs and such were put away, the entire group came back to the same area which is a small courtyard and had a cocktail hour. \n\nMy daughter and her husband were married in the far back arena where they have the outdoor concerts and therein lies the only reason this wonderful place does not get five stars. \n\nIf you have your wedding at this particular site, park your car in the dirt lot that is adjacent to the unloading area. It is the first right as you come into the park and has a sign posted that reads \""""Service area only.\"""" I understand that during the afternoon the park may want you to stroll leisurely through the park enjoying the natural beauty of the place but at the end of a very long day, it would've been so much better to park in back and take a 5 min. walk as opposed to an agonizing 15 min. stroll. \nIt was incredibly hard for some of the older folks in the group making their way back to the cars and by the time the wedding ended, it was late and the only rangers we saw were on our way out. \n\nIt was also very dark there and the lights on the canopy over the wedding table did not come on for a long time but eventually they did and it was truly breathtaking (you may want to have someone be the on the watch for this so the wedding party doesn't eat in the dark.) Lovely place to have a party or wedding, parking not so great. \n\nThank you DBG for making my daughter's wedding so very memorable!"""

I've worked in landscaping and know a lot about desert plants, but we learned a lot of cultural stuff, too. \nI went back for the Chihuly exhibit. It's the coolest thing I have ever seen, and some of the sculptures were so beautiful I cried a little. \nThe staff is a lot of volunteers, so you know they enjoy being there. In fact, I am going to talk to them about volunteering as soon as the holidays are over.\nI can't wait to go again!"""

"2,""Stayed here for a long weekend for a friend's wedding in Mesa. Driving from Southern California, it was located conveniently near the freeway and parking was easy! Check in was a breeze, the receptionist was very friendly- he gave us two warm cookies and a map of the surrounding area to help us out. Looks a bit outdated from the outside, but don't judge a book by the cover- the rooms are definitely kept up very nicely! The room was so spacious! Upon entering, there is a couch that turns into a bed, with a desk that was convenient when we ordered pizza and ate around it. There is a microwave, large fridge and everything was so clean! The separate room was nice, with a king bed that was large and comfy and had nice closet space to hang our clothes for the wedding. We went to the Belvedere restaurant downstairs on the first night to grab some drinks and the drinks were very overpriced but I guess that's expected for a hotel bar. We loved everything about the hotel, especially the complimentary breakfast located in the restaurant. Buffett style, with a different main entree that differed everyday (like french toast, pancakes, and waffles) with sausage, bacon, yogurt, pastries and coffee! Would definitely recommend staying here and will plan on returning to this hotel once baseball spring training comes around for my Dodgers!"""

"2,""My family and I have had our Phoenix zoo membership for 1 year now. We love it! It is worth every penny. We go at least 1 time per month and always have a great time. The volunteers are extremely friendly, we have only met 1 who was not. Even when it is too hot in the summer to do anything outdoors we go to the zoo. We play at the water park then go straight home. \n\nWe watch many families (parents) rushing their children through the zoo to the point that the kids don't have fun. With a membership we are always walking at a leisurely pace. Sometimes we go and only see a hand full of animals. Sometimes we go to ride our bikes around and don't stop at the animals at all. \n\nWe love that the new Kimono Dragon exhibit is in, and are excited to see the Orangutan exhibit being started. My daughter is learning quite alot at the zoo. At 5 she is already interested in traveling the world to see these animals in their native habitat. \n\nNow, I must say...

"1,""The PHX zoo is a great place to take your kids to look at large, charismatic megafauna.  However, if you are like me, you go to the zoo to try and learn something about the natural history and ecology of the animals on display.  There is very little of this, the farthest that the signage goes is to tell you the continent and maybe, if you are lucky, the country where the animal lives. The zoo is also mammal heavy. Don't get me wrong, I love a good mammal display, but I also like to see a nice collection of amphibians and reptiles.  If that is what you like to see, the PHX zoo is not the place for you.  They do have a small collection of southwestern rattlesnake and some common pet amphibians, but that is it for the herps...  They also have a komodo dragon that is pretty large but overall, they lack the fish, amphibians, and reptiles.  Also, where is the insect collections? Maybe I missed it.\n\nThe animals do have very large enclosures, but some look under kept.  Also, there is one aviary that is very cool and has some very pretty bird species.  They have red eared sliders hanging out in the ponds on the grounds that are probably the reason sliders are in natural waterways now...  a shame...\n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed in the PHX zoo, the admission was pricey, and the breadth of animals small."""

"1,""Well this has been one of my favorite courses since I moved here in 1988. I have played this course many, many times. However it has a few years since I have been there and I had yet to play the new renovated course.  I have used the practice range a few times since the course reopened and like the new additions so I was excited to play the course again and see the new changes.  I was a little disappointed.  The carts are new Club Car's and they are equipped with a GPS featured that disables the golf cart if the driver takes the cart into an area where it should not be. I can certain understand how this is a good idea. However I think they have the settings a little too high.  If you approach the green from the wrong side the disable feature engages.  The cart paths are for the most part gone.  They are still in a temporary club house from 2 years ago.  I read in the paper that the management company that was awarded the contract to run the course is having some challenges.   That is an understatement. \n\nSo I guess this course will go down in my memory similar to the other Phoenix landmarks that are now gone.  Similar to the old Cine Capri Movie theater on 24th street.  I would rather remember Papago Golf Course as the great muni it was, rather then the course in disrepair that it is now."""

"2,""If you have a Mercedes, you need to take it here! Being new in the area, I wasn't sure who to trust. I made the mistake of taking it to the dealer for an oil change and came out with a $300 bill. Seriously? It's oil and a filter. \n\nI tried this shop and found the owner worked at the dealership for 20 years before opening his own shop. Wow, nice people, and great service. He fixed what I needed and recommended a few things (the same things Firestore mentioned when I took it there for new tires and brakes, so I knew it wasn't an up sell.) I called around and M B Motors still had the lowest price. M B Motors fixed my car in a timely manner and showed me everything they did. \n\nTheir hours are early in the day 6:30 - 3:30 so it's convenient to drop off before work, but a little difficult to pick up. Nothing that would effect me taking my car there. Who wants to work on hot cars when it's 110 degrees out!\n\nI feel much better now that I have a place to take my Benz, especially being a single female and not knowing much about cars or what to do."""
"2,""I have lived here my whole life.  And for most of that time I have pretty much eaten gringocized Mexican food.  You know, Ajo Al's, Macayo's, Garcia's, etc.  At this point, it is still a treat for me, but I would rather eat at the authentic Mexican dive with actual Spanish on the menu, dishes I don't recognize and very few white people in the place.  El Nopalito fits the bill perfectly.  This place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on Chowhound.  It was right in my neighborhood, but I never got around to trying it until last week. \n\nWe showed up on a Friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and, sadly, laying off employees.  Ick.  We started with two Cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa.  Both salsas were outstanding, which in my experience is rare.  Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.  I had the leftover enchiladas today for lunch and they were awesome all over again.  We'll be back to El Nopalito often.  I'm excited to try the 99 cent street tacos."""
"2,""Tried this place on a lazy Sunday evening at the recommendation of other reviews, and I would say what others have said is pretty accurate. It is very authentic, looks like a total dive from the outside, and it's in a Hispanic neighborhood. But, the tacos here are great! Now, just to be clear, these are street style tacos, they are small, but they are only $0.99/each, which seems pretty reasonable. \n\nI ordered an adobada, al pastor, carnitas, and a shredded beef with red chiles. Each were very good in their own unique ways, the meat was good quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor. The adobada was the standout in my mouth, so much that I had to go back and order another one! I also had a side of rice and beans, which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nSo far so good, right? The only slip up this place maybe has, is that my girlfriend, that was with me, who doesn't eat meat, was not overly impressed. She got a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco. The shrimp taco looked good, and she said everything tasted alright, but she was not wowed, like I was, about the quality of the tacos. She did enjoy the beans and rice though. So, this place might not be the best veg friendly location, but I'm not really going to take off for that, because it is very authentic, and veg friendly isn't necessarily what they are trying to do. They are trying to make good, traditional tacos, and that they do that very well. \n\nThey also serve beer here, and I love the way it's served. Your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted, salted, and has lime juice in the bottom. Speaking of bringing you the glass, the service is wonderful. Our server was very friendly, patient, nice and helpful. \n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a good taco shop, nothing fancy, and authentic, this might be your best bet. Or at least it is from the places I have been so far..."""
"1,""Came here looking for soup dumplings after having an amazing experience in NYC's Chinatown. I know it's really not fair to compare this place with what we had in NYC, but I definitely left disappointed. \n\nThe service was lightening fast, but there was definitely the feeling that we received different service since we weren't Asian. For example, soup dumplings are pretty impossible to eat without the small porcelain spoon, but we received no utensils to eat them with at all. \n\nThe eggplant was good, but was saltier and more sour than I was expecting. My mother said that her duck was pretty dry despite the copious amount of sauce on the plate. \n\nOverall, I would say good effort for Phoenix, but I won't be returning."""
"1,""Maybe I'm doing it wrong. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills (you can buy a bottle of 10,000 for $6 at Costco)... but I hate this place. \n\nI break out in hives every time I think about having to go here... So then why do I go here, you may ask. The same reason as everyone else. The same reason listed in all of these glowing reviews... to save a little bit of money.\n\nI come here for almost the same thing every time. Diet Coke, allergy meds and giant bags of frozen chicken breast. Those are my three go-to items. Every few months there's the toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent... blah, blah, blah. You know the drill.\n\nWhy do I hate it so...? \n\nPretty much for the same reason I have a deep disdain for Walmart. It's chaos. And in true Walmart fashion, I actually saw someone wearing their pajamas here the other day. \n\nPeople walk around here lulled into some kind of trance by price savings and free samples. It's maddening. In the parking lot, in the store... waiting to turn INTO the parking lot... people are crazy. They completely stop paying attention to what's going on around them. I've been touched inappropriately by shopping carts, nearly run into by cars. It's insanity. \n\nOh and by the way, speaking of parking lots... why the hell aren't there more cart return areas. I think I've seen two... It's generally a game of, can I find a spot to hide this cart, or should I just walk it to the front of the store. \n\nAnother thing: A lot of people talk about the great fuel savings... I've never purchased fuel here. Wanna know why? Because every time I come here, the line for fuel is no less than 3 cars deep per lane! No thanks. I'll pay 10 cents more per gallon somewhere else. \n\nAs I sit here typing... anxiety level rising, I wonder to myself... are the savings really worth it? And for now, sadly, the answer is yes. But one day... One Day Costco! I will be free."""
"1,""Came here for a drug screen for a new job. Tried to call for 2 days to set up a time to come in. Time is money.

Show up, find out there is over an hour wait just to pee in a cup. Ask if there is any way I can just go because this whole procedure is going to take less the a minute to do. Ask to speak to a manager. David. Who is extremely rude and proceeds to tells I can either wait or leave. I explain I have been trying to call the location to set up a time were he basically tells me that there is nothing wrong with the phones he has been talking on them all day. But I have been here over 30 minutes now and have not heard the phone ring once. Overall the place is dirty. The wait is ridiculous especially for a basic drug screen and the staff is extremely rude.

I found this Applebee's not too far away and also in the same parking lot as Target (killing two birds with one stone). It was my first meal here, since all of my belongings (read: pots, pans, cooking utensils) were on an 18-wheeler somewhere in the vast Phoenix metropolis. The people here were friendly enough, and I like their \""""550\"""" menu of dishes fewer than 550 calories. \n\nSo while I've grown fond of finding and frequenting locally-owned joints, on occasion I do hit a chain.

We were just going to get a quick bite so they could close. Terrie was very friendly and honest about what I should order to get a good deal. I tried the wonton tacos and they were delicious. We also had spinach and artichoke dip, they gave us lots of chips and Terrie helped us box them up with some extra salsa. \n\nNext time I am in Phoenix and want Applebee's, I will go to this location simply because of the service we received."""
"1,""This placement doesn't even deserve a star so I guess one will do. The only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess, after that everything else went downhill. My server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food. She looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust. Brought me a meal different from what I ordered and didn't have the guts to apologize for it. The food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold. Very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat. Place wasn't that busy so I fail to understand why it took over 30 min to get my food. And it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me. When she asked me how the food was, I told her that it wasn't what I ordered and she just rolled her eyes. I was tired and didn't want to start fussing with her so I just paid and left. But one thing I can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when I requested for my check, it came in less than 30 seconds. This is the worst Applebee's experience I've ever had in my life and I don't think I ever want to go to an Applebee's if this is the kind of service I get. Over to you Mr. Applebee's CEO."""

"1,""Walking into Macayo's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a Vegas casino. Tacky, tacky, tacky. Loud wall paper. Lots of different rooms. And the people. Oh, the people! Men in Hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys. Women with big hair and lots of screaming kids. Staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly. Standard Mexican fare is widely available. Stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy. The carnitas entree is a sad clump of dry pork...gee, I think that's the same thing my Uncle Larry said of his third ex wife. Anyhoo, the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu. You have to ask for it. Served with a variety of blue, yellow and red corn chips, the dippin is fun and filling. The guacamole is pretty good although it seems there's a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit. I really like the mini chicken chimichangas. The minis, not the regular sized. The latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper. Macayo's is a family owned, famous Phoenix restaurant landmark. The Central Ave. location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the dee-lish factor. My recommendation is two shots of chilled Patron before the food and everything seems better. Hola and adios!"""
"1,""A very odd experience.  \n\nWe entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess.  We told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what I thought was the bar area. Well, yes but she took us out the back door of the restaurant, to the back door of the bar.  Once there I started to get nervous.  A line of 4 or 5 people waiting to get in met by two security people checking Identification.  \n\nOnce you show the security people your ID, they then put a wrist band on you.  I am pushing 50, but perhaps without the wrist band, someone may mistake me for under 21.  \n\nFinally inside, it was a throw back to some 80's nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more, at attention security staff.  \n\nThey feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted Mexican food, which was actually fresh and tasty.

"2,""Happened upon this restaurant while staying at a nearby hotel. We drove by earlier in the day and were first interested in the unique architecture of the building.

Unfortunately it was missing spinach. Hmm... There were some green chiles, however, that added to the cheese dip. I ordered a beef chimichanga with their famous baja sauce.

"1,""No, no, no, no. That's all I can say if you are planning on eating here.  \n\nMy daughter and I went in today, on a Sunday afternoon, because we couldn't find another Mexican restaurant that was open on Sunday in central Phoenix. The service was fine but the food was awful. The beans tasted like they came from a can (Rosarita brand) and the salsa was just barely palatable for the same reason. We each ate only half of our food before  leaving.  \n\nWhen the waiter asked how the food was, I told him and all he did was say he was sorry. No offer to bring something else or comp one of our half-eaten meals. \n\nMacayo's on Central used to have fresh food, now it is just stale and tastes like it comes from a can.

"2,""It's my little sister's 17th birthday (yes, I feel old considering I remember changing her diapers!) and I wanted to do something special for her.

So (of course) I turned to Yelp and found Cactus Flowers. \n\nThey have a great website showing photos of all their arrangements (see \""""Cactus Flower Exclusives\"""" for prearranged, local delivery options), and they even offer national deliveries through FTD. I found a gorgeous bouquet and even had the option of adding balloons, chocolates, and a teddy bear. I went with the balloons because I was sending them to my sister's school and I just HAD to go for the best (AKA most embarrassing) visual display possible!! \n\nI placed the order yesterday (hooray for next-day delivery - and even same-day delivery if you order before 1pm) and realized today that I did not specify delivery time. Having the flowers arrive after she's left school for the day isn't the surprise I was going for!! So I sent them an email explaining the situation and asked ever so nicely that they please try to deliver before 2pm. Just over an hour later, which was after noon in Arizona - less than 2 hours before my requested delivery time - I received a response that it was taken care of. How great is that?!?! \n\nI'm still waiting to get a call from my sister (I'm sure I'll post an update later today to say how it turned out), but right now they have a very satisfied customer! \n\nThe Cactus Flower Exclusives are gorgeous and go for $35 and up (+ tax and delivery, which is $13 - $15). National deliveries also start at $35 + tax and delivery. \n\n- 1 Star because the bouquet arrangements most people lean towards start at about $50, which is kinda pricey (only smaller arrangements with a handful of short stem flowers in a short vase are $35)"""

About 2 pounds. Price: 25.00. When I lived in Oregon last year, I was able to get 4 pounds of corned beef (a very cheap cut and preparation of beef) for under $10.

Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.\n\nNormally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.\n\nI recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.  If you do visit, pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.  Who knows, you may become a regular before you know it."""
"1,""I really hate to give this place a less than stellar review because I want to like it so badly! The location is great, far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like you're in a more urban area. Big family style benches allow for friend-making outside and individual tables inside. I'm surprised I came back after the first time. On a busier night, we couldn't get service to save our lives. We made sure we weren't stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat, staring at servers running AROUND us for 15 minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead. We sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited, trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so I could merely ask where the bathroom was at-but nothing. I even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after 10 more minutes we gave up. Apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word! That being the last straw, our feelings a little hurt, and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service, we left half full beers and walked out upset. I still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong! \nNow, we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent. For mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that I usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for. I don't see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that I like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friends/coworkers. We still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but I can't seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth. Bummersville."""

"1,""Stopped into this shop during spring training.  The staff was nice but he really pushed the Kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop.  We bought 3 of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them.  The cigars didn't draw well and were generally not very good.  We went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent $170 there the day before and only bought the Kristoffs on their recommendation (at 10 a stick).

"2,""I don't know why others had such a problem with the owner Petey: I went in for the first time last weekend and he was just fine.

Be sure to also ask for lots of napkins because you'll be crying when you finally see the nonsense that comes out of the kitchen.\n\nThe way I see it, cooking omlettes is very simple: you take good ingredients, mix them together, cook it all without burning.

"1,""Hubby insisted we had eaten here before. I thought not. I was partly right, as we have eaten at the Good Egg before, and not been very pleased. Hubby had hated their crepe-eggs. We didn't know the connection between the two restaurants before we sat down.\n\nStarving, I order their farmhouse eggs benedict and Hubby orders their breakfast quesadilla and an Oreo pancake (he just HAD to try it). We both get iced tea and it tastes funny, like it was made with bad tap water. When the food arrives, Hubby inhales his quesadilla, but says nothing about its quality. The Oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table. I gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny, nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy. The only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs. The turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right- it's not crispy and the taste is off. The biscuits taste like they are from a mix. To top it off, the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table. Nice. Can you at least pretend you didn't just give me the leftover water from someone else's table? Our server never returns to fill our tea (except when dropping off the check), or even to see how things are. Maybe he knows better than to ask."""
"1,""The first time I experienced The Eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room. As I walked through the restaurant, I was surprised it was so busy...I mean this IS a breakfast place, right? \n\nThe decor is very outdated with knick knack cutter EVERYWHERE. I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place. \n\nI ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a disappointment! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food. \n\nYesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church. Maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch. Same awful decor, but it seemed a bit more charming at 10:30am. \n\nI had the Berry Blintz Crepes which were pretty good. Stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt, mixed berries, cottage cheese, and a little bit of cream cheese. Whipped cream, toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes. It seemed like a lot of food for $7.50, a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad. \n\nI am not in any hurry to return to the Eggery, although my business group meets there every week. Nico did point out that I have been here twice now and have yet to actually try any EGG dish. Maybe next time..."""
"1,""Wow. Just, wow. As a former employee of this location, I'm sorely disappointed. I used to be a hostess here and always LOVED the food. So I figured I'd take my boyfriend to grab a nice breakfast. Boy was I wrong. I ordered the huevos rancheros with chorizo (always been my favorite) and ended up with eggs and bland potatoes, with chunky sour cream (ew) and a light sprinkling of chorizo. Um, what? I paid almost 30 bucks for this? The food was bland and not good at all. I couldn't even finish my meal it was that bad. I'll never go back. How disappointing. Maybe you should stop recruiting your employees/chefs from McDonalds. The good egg has really let itself go."""

"1,""I like their variety in products, however they always have peddlers there asking for money and making people uncomfortable, but they don't seem to do anything about it.\n\nAlso almost every single time I go to the pharmacy, they never have my prescription ready, even after they've called me to tell me it was ready. One day I called it in about 3 days early, just to make sure I could stop by anytime before I ran out to pick up my prescription.It turned out I wasn't able to pick it up until the day that I ran out anyway, and even though I had called in three days earlier, it still wasn't ready! To add to this frustration, I have gone in and waited for up to 3 hours for prescription to be ready, when I was told it would only take 15 to 30 minutes. Lastly, they have the automatic prescription refill, when they call you to tell you that it's ready when your prescription runs out. I signed up for this, however they didn't call me the last time I had a refillb ready because they weren't aware it needed to be refilled, and the time before that they called me to tell me it was ready and when I showed up it wasn't ready. I'm sick of waiting here and eating my time for my prescriptions. I am taking my business elsewhere."""

"1,""The only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one star is because I really had a good appointment with Whitney Padgett, the nurse practitioner. She was kind, down-to-earth, smart and a good listener. However, in the end it was the doctor and one of the front office staff members who are the reasons why I won't return to this practice. As a 30-year-old married woman who moved to Scottsdale from CA, I was hoping to establish a relationship with an OBGYN here in the Valley so that I already have a trusting relationship with a doctor when my husband and I decide to have a baby. I was a happy patient of my last doctor for 12 years.  I scheduled my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was seen by Whitney Padgett. It has always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time going to a specialist. I was a bit shocked that I was seen only by Whitney and never a doctor at all, even though I was new to the practice. This aside, I returned for a second appointment and this time I saw Dr. Carol Hahn. I came to my appointment with Dr. Hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment, so naturally I was a bit worried. From the moment she walked in, Dr. Hahn was curt and condescending. She spoke to me as if I were below her. (I'm a professional working women who is married to a doctor) She typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact. And, at one point corrected me as I was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam. However, the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if I was a teenage girl, \""""Are you sexually active?\"""" I know this is a standard question, but my chart indicates that I am a married woman and that I take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention. Do you think she could have read my chart?? Or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice? As I left this appointment, I was paying my co-pay and getting ready to head to work, I was told that I could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment. I explained that I had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail. I was told that I could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there. When I explained that I'm still within the due date and that I have it ready to go in the mail, the lady told me that I would need to wait for a manager to approve it before I could leave. I told her that I needed to get to work and that I did not have the time to discuss this. I put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door. I can tell you that I will never return to this practice again. From the level of care I received to the treatment and finally the billing practices, this place was an unpleasant experience."""

I'll instantly halve it when I get home to prevent me from overeating. It is very good. Their guacamole is very good, too. They also have a pick 2 combo for $6 and gives you smaller portions of your choice of the naked burrito, mexican soup, tacos, cheese quesadilla, etc. The other thing I like about this place is the rewards program and also how nice the employees always are.

"2,""Last year, our very active toddler (then 2-yrs-old) was diagnosed with a bone cyst in his femur. Our pediatrician gave us a list of orthopedic surgeons to consult and although Dr. Shindell was at the top of the list, we actually went to the second name -- one of the largest orthopedic groups in the valley -- first. When we met with that first surgeon, he said he could help our son but given the size and placement of the cyst and the risk of it breaking, he recommended that we go to someone who handles these type of cases more often. We asked who he would recommend if it were his son, and he said Dr. Shindell.\n\nWhen we called Dr. Shindell's office, they were able to get us in for an appointment the next day. Needless to say, we were extremely anxious, but Dr. Shindell's calm demeanor and extensive experience helped us worry less. He explained all the options (including a brand new procedure that just finished clinical trials) and possible long-term effects. There was absolutely no pressure to take any one option over the others, and he was willing to give us the weekend to think over our options.\n\nIt took us about 20-minutes to decide what to do. Dr. Shindell immediately set up the surgery date and called Hanger Orthotics to squeezed us in for a fitting even though it was the end of day on a Friday.\n\nThe following week, our son had his surgery (would have been sooner, but we had to wait for his custom brace to be made). Dr. Shindell met us at the hospital to explain the details of the surgery ahead of time. After the surgery, he met us in the waiting room and explained the recovery plan and what to expect. Shindell again checked on our son the following day to see how he was recovering. Every time, he explained everything fully so that we could understand what was going on.\n\nWe still see Dr. Shindell regularly to check on the progress of our son's bone graft.

Even take-out usually takes over an hour!\n\nI suppose that's evidence of the restaurant's overall quality, but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad, because they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted."""
"2,""Oregano's on Camelback is one of our favorite places to go for dinner & some beers. We always take out of town guests there.\n\nThe outdoor seating in particular is one of our favorite places to hang out, eat and drink. You can enjoy your food while relaxing in an oasis-like environment outside, enjoying the breeze, the sun or a sunset. Good music is always playing (jazz and other boppy tunes) and they have heaters over the tables outside for when it gets cold at night.\n\nThey have a decent beer and wine selection, including some good ones for beer connoisseurs. Pitchers of beer pricing is reasonable.\n\nThe food is fantastic. For appetizers, we really like the Guacatoni (quesadilla served with fresh guac) and the spicy ravioli's. Pizza lovers will love their selection of pie types and calzones. There's also a good variety of pastas and salads.\n\nFor us, it doesn't get much better then Oregano's. Yes, the place is usually crowded and you'll have to wait for a table. Yes, there are birds tweeting and hopping around outside, but we love the atmosphere and the food and drinks."""
"1,""Waited over an hour to be seated just to see people who got here after us get a table...yeah the girl crossed us off the list for no reason. Noobs at the bar left us waiting to pay for the drinks we got while we were waiting, and then when we finally get seated guess what, it's another hour wait for our pizza.... Could have told us that before the first hour!!! Save yourself the 2 hours of waiting and go to Pizza Hut, you'll be much less dissatisfied. I would give this place zero stars if I could."""
"1,""I've left a review before saying that I love this place and they have great service!  Boy did my waiter prove me wrong today!! We had the worst service ever!

"1,""slow service. The banana blueberry bead was so so. Rolls were so so.  Sushi wasn't bad, not awesome. Service was total poops."""
"2,""Absolutely delicious, and a very pleasant surprise.  While it seems like a little strip mall joint, it's really quite pretty inside.\n\nThe menu is extensive, and full of vegetarian options (important for me, a veggie).  We shared the ginger eggplant app to start, and then shared some veggie rolls as well. One diner got the chicken parm (oh yes...they also have Italian food...and yummy banana bread along with white rolls), two of us got only sushi, and I got the mushroom tofu dish.\n\nEveryone cleared their plates. Very tasty, and quite affordable.\n\nOne thought - their mixed drinks, at the least the specialty ones, are really odd. I definitely won't be ordering that again. However, everything else was tasty, and we'll be back. Just don't go if you're in a hurry - service left something to be desired. Like the bill."""
"1,""So let's get this out of the way up front: The food here's pretty good. There I said it. I always enjoy the food, there's not been one thing there that I've eaten that I didn't like. That being said, food isn't going to make me return to a place to eat. We usually get takeout from CB because their service flat out sucks. My wife made me go with her this past weekend, because I've been making her get takeout form Hula Modern Tiki the past few times (Hula's great). So against my will, and because it was on the eve of Valentine's day, I decided to cave against my better judgement. I should be totally ticked, but because they didn't fail my expectations and screwed up my meal/deliviered craptacular service, wifey won't be making me go again. Win, I think.  I always make it a point to order the dinner special from places with the idea that the chefs are sick and tired of cooking the same stuff on the menu, and will be invigorated at cooking something new and exciting. This particular night, I opted for the Miso Marinated Sea Bass. Sounds great, right? I'll never know.....the server never brought it to me. Appetizer arrived, wife's meal arrived, daughter's bowl of steamed rice arrived, beer arrived, sake arrived, check arrived. Not in that order, but you get my drift. So my meal consisted of some of my wife's sushi, some of my daughter's steamed rice, some of the appetizer, beer, sake and table bread. Happy Valentines to you Cherry Blossom!  If anybody's thinking of checking this place out, get takeout. The food's good, but I can get better service at QT. (Yes, the gas station)"""
"2,""I'm here pretty regularly, since it is within walking distance of my house. Sometimes I feel like I'm paying a bit too much, but I've started frequenting the specials and Happy Hour menu, which has alleviated some of that. I've tried the sushi, the gyozo bowl, the salads, and some of the pasta dishes. Everything has been pretty good.\n\nThe gyozo bowl is awesome. It reminds me of the spicy Korean ramen my mom would make me with mondu (Korean dumplings). It's pretty spicy and flavorful. I love sitting at the bar and ordering--things come out faster and you can watch with excitement as the cooks prepare the food. I've noticed a lot of the flavors run together and taste similar, but I'm okay with that because they're good flavors.\n\nFrom the outside, it really does look like a shady asian spot, but the inside is quirky and classy. The walls are brick and the decorations are well-chosen. It's a good place for a date or to meet a friend for a casual happy hour."""
"1,""I don't get what people like about this place. It's generally crowded with rushed service and the food has yet to impress. I've tried at least twice -- maybe I'm ordering wrong but I really just don't get it..."""

"2,""I find myself at CherryBlossom a lot nowadays, and that's why I needed to update my review. I've discovered my new favorite menu items, and they must be eaten! So, you should try:\n\nSpicy Gyoza Pot\nCha-shu Ramen\nTanTan-Men Ramen\nUdon Suki\n\nThe gyoza pot is my favorite menu item (and it's on happy hour).  It's simple and delicious. I am completely satisfied with a Kirin and the gyoza pot for dinner. The Cha-shu is a damn good bowl of ramen, and the TanTan is even better if you're up for something spicy. My newest discovery, and the reason I needed to write this, is the Udon Suki. It consists of udon noodles, tofu, green onions, sliced beef, and a poached egg floating in a savory broth. CherryBlossom's Udon Suki is awesome, filling, and awesome.\n\nI have come to the realization that the service is hit or miss at this place, but in my opinion, the food makes up for any shortcomings. Go try some of the dishes I just mentioned and let me know what you think!"""
"2,""Been desperately (desperately!) searching for a ramen place in Phx after discovering the deliciousness that is ramen in San Diego, and I was pleasantly surprised when I drove by the \""""Noodles\"""" sign on my way to a hair appointment down the street at Shampoo Ink.  Made a mental note to stop in afterwards for lunch. I am SO glad I did!\n\nService was stellar - really some of the best service I've had in a LONG time.  Super friendly and attentive.\n\nThe ramen dishes were all pork per the menu, but they were nice enough to sub chicken for me instead of the pork.  DELISH!  SO good.  No veggies like the place I love in Oceanside, CA, but still, the flavor was there and it was awesome.\n\nThis will be my new lunch place EVERY time I get my hair done."""
"2,""I've been here only once for lunch and I was really pleased.  I think the Bento Box is the best value, perfect for a quick lunch.  The decor is really surprisingly authentic to a neighborhood ramen-ya in Japan.  The staff were very nice.  I took a little tart with me as a treat for later, loved it, and wished I'd gotten more.  I'm definitely going back again."""
"2,""If it's a GREAT bowl of traditional Japanese noodle soup you're in search of, this is it. \n\nI'm sold solely on their noodle soup bowls that I haven't tried any of their other entrees. The bowls are big, you get a good amount for your buck in my opinion. \n\nThe TanTan Men is good if you're looking for a spicy soup.\nThe Miso is great if you're feeling a seafood soup.\nThe Hakata soup"
"2,""Been here a few times. It's a strange mix of foods (sushi, ramen, and Italian?!) with the ambiance more like a French cafe, but it somehow works. Their pad thai is tasty and I love the udon. The portions are quite large and they don't skimp on protein. Staff is all very friendly and it doesn't break the bank. I want to come back and try the ramen, the table across from me demolished theirs so it must be good."""

I called up to dispute the amount, and although my call was third I have been waiting 94 minutes with an automated message saying my call is next ... it is now 4:59pm on Friday, I am doubting I will get an answer even though it has been saying my call is next for over an hour.

Perfect cake, perfect icing.  Great challah, too.  Their other bakery items were also quite good....rugelach, hamentashen, brownies, cookies.

Didn't say they couldn't find them or that they weren't in stock.

"1,""This place has been around forever, but I can't really understand why. The restaurant is run down. The service was pretty awful - it took forever to place our order, we sat with empty water glasses, then there were missing dishes, messed up dishes, we needed silverware, etc. And from the moment you try the salsa that tastes like canned tomato sauce, you'll know that the food just isn't good. There are many better options for Mexican food around this area."""
"1,""Terrible. For a city so lavishly seasoned with some of the best Mexican food on the planet, this place coulnt have been worse if it tried. Outdated, dingy, dining space and help. I love me a good hole in the wall, but Jordan's can't even hit that mark. Avoid it!!!"""

"2,""Bottom line: Scott's has a matzo ball soup so good I can't imagine how anyone could ever hate the Jews. Best bagels in Phoenix, hands down. Take your Einstein's and shove it.\nScott's has an expansive menu that ranges across breakfast, traditional deli offerings, and a strong but semi random assortment of 'home cooking' type meals that your mom makes but you never see in restaurants. I haven't spent a lot of time in delis in New York, but Scott's reminds me of the \""""New York deli\"""" I used to live around the corner from in Houston, down the street from the JCC - tasty, simple, and unapologetic, about anything. I love their soups, although their pastrami is not the best I've ever had. They have every flavor of Dr Brown's imaginable. The portions are huge - too huge, actually. I'm minuscule, so the prospect of a sandwich that is 3x what I can eat in one sitting is daunting to the point that I only go if I know I can take a box home. The service runs hot and cold, but I've never not gotten what I wanted the way I wanted it, and if the waitress isn't looking at me with vague disapproval, I feel like it's not an authentic New York experience."""

"2,""We had planned on going to the Rhythm Room, which is directly across the street, but they were still charging a full cover at midnight, and just wanting to have a late-night cocktail, we took our hard-earned cash to Friends.  Just as we walked in, a drag show was ending, which was a treat.  Only wishing we had gotten there sooner, we sat down and ordered drinks.  I was amazed at the selection of flavored vodkas and other booze they have.  Not feeling too adventurous in that area I ordered a Ketel One Citroen on the rocks.  Generously poured, I don't remember the price, but I am sure it wasn't too steep.  As the night went on the place thinned out, and soon the wife and I were the only two people in the place.  The bartender, Anthony, was a joy to talk to.  We ended up just hanging with him until it was time to go.  I would go back just to have a bartender that good. Hell, the place is called Friends, and I'd be his friend any day. He was full of conversation and laughs.  At the end of the night, he called us a cab and made sure I didn't leave anything behind in my Ketel One haze.  He nearly had to come out to the parking lot to give me a record I left on the bar from a concert we attended earlier in the evening.\n\nThis place really is a comfortable and clean neighborhood bar that was welcoming to a random couple having a fun night on the town.  It was a great way to end a great night out.\n\nAlso, I would totally wear a friends T-shirt if they have them.  I love the logo."""
"2,""Now let me preface this review by saying I am an East Coast gal with over 30 yrs experience in eating the BEST Pizza & I absolutely love the crust (hand tossed of course) @ Pizza Heaven. I was walking back from the Christmas light show and saw the PH sign in Neon Orange calling me into this place.  Right Choice. Since then I have been there weekly and sometimes twice a week.   The crust is crunchy and the cheese is delicately melting throughout.  I always get mine with pepperoni but when ever I spot someone else pizza looking a smelling divine (pardon the pun Heavenly) I change the order to find that I now have another favorite  Ranch Chicken Pizza. Who would have thought cheddar cheese would taste that good on pizza. TRY IT!!!!  One thing, service is different in the day time, counter lady is very helpful in knowing the menu there & that's a plus and when I come during the evening, the sit and be waited on service is not so terrific.The boys tend to sit at the counter and surf the phones and talk with the kitchen staff and forget about the tables. I'd rather come during the day or take out to get better service.\nWish they had a full bar to sit at that would be fun and an outside venue too."""

"2,""After returning from my trip from a big city fashion district, my inner creative genius led me to Sas Fabric. Upon entering the location I felt a gush of endless and surreal inspiration. \nWhy the fuss over a fabric shop you might ask? The fuss is over Sas Fabric shop! Move over Joanns, Walmart or any other ratty fabric place because no one beats Sas! An array of funky, bright, subtle, soft, crisp, shiny, and neutral fabrics fill your eyesight welcoming you to explore! My imagination was running wild in here! I felt as if I was at a true NYC fabric supplier! Other fabric stores in Phoenix simply do not compare and carry FAR less unique fabrics. Joanne is also more catered to the grandma crowd rather than the modern D.I.Y. creative soul. I highly recommened Sas for all fabric related projects. I've become loyal to Sas for its quality and superior selection. The staff is also very quick and experienced so they get you on your way to fulfill your creative urges! Five stars :)"""

Yes!!   I was super excited to find it in all three colors.  And to add to the awesomeness of my find, my whole purchase, out the door, was only about $12.  Score!!  \n\nBe warned that this places is overflowing with fabric and sewing notions and finding exactly what you want can be a challenge, and their customer service is VERY limited.

"2,""My wife (who is from Phoenix and spent countless meals at this restaurant) characterized this place to me as the \""""Gay Denny's\""""--a label I was apprehensive about mentioning in my review until I read the the reviews of other Yelpers.

Please note that even Yelp categorizes this place under \""""Diners, Gay Bars\"""".  That speaks volumes of coolness.\n\nThere is little to distinguish this from any other Denny's, and during the day it is the mild-mannered place we are all familiar with.  But at night, and particularly in the wee hours of the morning, the alt crowd arrives.  Many people from Goth and LGBTQ clubs pile in here for food at that time after dancing and socializing.  My wife and I went here after our visit to Sanctum--she walked in with her Gothy attire and no-one batted an eye.  The place had quite a crowd at 2am and they were mostly a fairly young, hip group.\n\nFood was. . .Denny's.  Service was fine.  If you go here at 2am, you know you're not going for the food in particular but for the crowd and maybe some people watching if you're into that sort of thing.

It just takes forever to get acknowledged when we walk in, to be sat, to have our order taken, to get our food, to get our bill, etc. It usually takes well over an hour for all of this. Under normal circumstances I would walk out of a place like that.

"2,""I write this review strictly as a seller, as I never come here solely to buy, always to sell and sometimes to trade.

The store has an interesting selection of accessories and clothing, the quality of which runs the gamut from cute cheap Chinese crap to OMG is this really $15 superior quality items. Look and look often because inventory turns over and fast. If you want a quick hit of something unique or need to offload some extra items, make a beeline for this place. It's environmentally responsible and they have a donation program for local nonprofit agencies. This is NOT a thrift store, so leave that notion at home.

When I showed him it looked fine to me and wouldn't that be covered by warranty, he got upset with me and began stomping around. I also showed him a warranty sticker from 2010 on the machine which stated that there was a new roller brush installed and also asked him to look up my Oreck warranty.

The pate is not house made and tasted like liverwurst, the onion tart was very good. However, once we learned that there was no wine service and a (correction, not $12) $9 corkage fee, that was the nail in the coffin, we were out the door. \n\nAt the end of the day they falsely tweeted to get customers in the door then try to pass off something that isn't.

"1,""Where to begin...I think I will start with the positive.   The brie brulee topped with the caramelized apple slices was a hit, the mixed green salad with goat cheese was awesome and the pear tart desert was outstanding.

"1,""Ordered steak fajitas which were very tough. Both the side servings of retried beans and rice were bland.  Overall there was a lack of favor as it seems their recipes do not allow for some spices.  A little cumin in the beans would make a huge difference   The rice was the most bland.  The  quantity was great but this is no trip to flavor town."""

"1,""My husband and I are new to Phoenix and have decided to try as many local places as possible. Intrigued by the outside decor, we ventured into this odd place. We ordered 2 meals and sat at a greasy, dirty table. \nOur wings and burger arrived and we were thoroughly disappointed. The wings (some spicy ranch and some garlic Parmesan) were soggy from the grease and extra chewy. The burger appeared to have been  put in the fryer with the wings. The bun was soggy and the patty doused in pepper. \nThey did try to make their greasy food healthier by handing out sandwich bags with carrots and ranch. Good effort. \nThe one star it gets is for decor and fries. The fries are great, just covered in salt (shake then it off and they will be fine.) The decor will keep you entertained and avoid awkward silences."""

Very disappointing, maybe Subway should invest in better training or maybe higher wages to get better staff."""
"2,""Hand's down this place is my favorite store in Phoenix.  Actually, it's my favorite store in Arizona.  I would be hard pressed to find a place cooler than this that caters so exactly to my every need and desire as a baker.\n\nI first came here when I was searching for a place to find cupcake liners in bulk.  I had just received an order from the school I work at to do cupcakes for their homecoming.  400 of them to be exact.  Ordering liners online would prove to be too pricey as would buying out every store's stock.  Somehow, even though I have driven by many many times, I did not even know this existed.  Now I certainly do.\n\nInside you will find a menagerie of things to delight everyone from the amateur baker to the professional pastry chef.  You will see rows of sprinkles, hundreds of cookie cutters, a rainbow of food coloring, dozens of specialty cake pans, and cake toppers galore.  I have never gone here and walked out unsatisfied.  I always find what I need.  \n\nIf I could walk around this place with a plate of bacon from Matt's, I would seriously think I had died and gone to heaven.  If you are ever in need of anything related to cakes and cake decorating, give this place a shot.  You will never consult a big box craft store for your needs ever again."""
"2,""This place must be heaven for those that are serious about their baking... \nI'm quite an amateur, but was super impressed nonetheless with the amount of baking tools and supplies that are squeezed into this store.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  I went in with a grocery list from my sister-in-law.  I needed to get red chocolate to melt, red sprinkles, and white and black frosting in a tube.  Our plan was to make \""""Muno\"""" pretzel rods (from Yo Gabba Gabba).  ABC had everything on my list and more... I ended up purchasing special candy \""""eyeballs\"""" instead of the white and black frosting and they worked perfectly!  (They came out super cute by the way and were pretty easy to make too!)\n\nI also bought some candles and a spatula.  I could have done a ton more damage"
"1,""They lost my clothes and three weeks later they still had not resolved the problem.  The manager was supposed to call me but didn't until I showed up in person and insisted.  Their idea of resolving the problem was waiting to see if they ever turned up on their own. Scary when their response was \""""what we usually do in this situation...\""""  They lose clothes that often?!?!  \n\nWhat clothes they did return were either wrinkled or stiff as cardboard (I requested light starch).  One pair of pants were torn.\n\nIf you value your clothes, do not use this incredibly unprofessional business. Go to American Cleaners instead.  They are friendly, professional and very well priced."""

And best of all, the bar has a total honky tonk feel that makes me want to run home and play Urban Cowboy with the mister."""
"2,""Simply put, if you like chicken fried steak and you haven't been here you don't really like chicken fried steak.  I've eaten chicken fried steak pretty much everywhere in the world that its available and it just doesn't get much better than this.  Go with the fried potatoes instead of the mashed.  Not that the mashed are bad, just that the fried potatoes are so GOOD.  For those that are less enthusiastic about chicken fried steak, the fried chicken breast is also great as are the steaks and burgers.  Love the house salad with light oil dressing and diced olives on top.  Oh, and the biscuits, top notch, TOP NOTCH.  Don't let them get away with bringing you a bread basket that's half filled with biscuits and half filled with some wheat roll disaster, ask for all biscuits.  You're welcome."""
"2,""This place is known for their chicken fried steak.  And they certainly do it right.  They have a billboard that is a running tally of how many servings of chicken fried steak they have served....now that's confidence in your product!  But if you feel like something else, they have an amazing prime rib (you have to get there early though....they only make a certain amount of prime rib each night and when they run out, they run out).  If you want something a little smaller---and that's not saying much, since their portions are huge, get the brisket sandwich, ask for the bbq sauce on the side, and ask for a side of au ju.

"1,""Kind of a depressing dive bar - not really my kind of hangout.  If I liked the burger, I'd recommend only ordering it to go.\n\nI went with a patty melt, and was not impressed.  The whole cooking with wine concept may seem like a good idea, and it does make for a slightly interesting flavor, but I wouldn't call it good.  Aside from the wine flavor, the meat wasn't very good anyway, just like the other fixins and the fries.  Combined with the atmosphere and general grungy feeling (I don't know how sanitary the place is, but I wouldn't bet on it passing inspection), I definitely won't be back."""
"2,""I finally got around to coming here last night, and I really like it!  I knew what I was getting into because A) I've been to the original wineburger at 19th ave and Bethany Home already, B) I've read the reviews and C) I knew that these two places were originally started by a pair of brothers many years ago.\n\nWalking in, its a real divey type place.  Wood paneling on the walls, simple no frill tables and chairs, with limited decorations and dimly lit.  It's set up exactly like its sister location the original wineburger, with half of it being a bar with chairs and tables, and the other half being a pool and congregating area for those that want to do more then sit and hang on the bar.  I also saw a pinball machine, which was pretty cool as well.\n\nThey have a few TV's hanging from the walls behind the bar with a variety of sporting events on for you to watch. Granted, I'm not a huge sports fan, but it's better then staring off into space or what not.  I sat at the bar, since I felt more comfortable there, and there wasn't to many people in here, so there was more then enough seating for me. I felt really comfortable here, and didn't feel like being around a million people anyways.\n\nThey have great beer and alcohol specials during happy hour, and they have a decent menu of items to choose from. Prices are great, and the bartender here was really super cool.  Him and I chatted throughout my meal and I really enjoyed the conversation.  I went with the Jumbo Hot dog, and it was tasty...charbroiled and all, I really liked it here.\n\nIf you want a low key night out, go check this place out. Divey, dark and not half bad. Will be back in the future. I think I like it here better then I did at the original one."""

The added avacado to them was nice.\n\nWe also had a veggie spring roll $3.50 Then 1/2 off for happy hour.  A soft rice noodle skin around fresh veggies sushi rice and peanut sauce. It was great like Vietnam meets Thailand.\n\nThey were nice enough to turn down the loud music for us make it a pleasant place to be, the curtains are cool and the beer selection included some micro brews. Not bad at all."""
"2,""The straight dope:\n\n4.5 star bar for hopheads and craft brew fans:  Not particularly extensive in terms of number of offerings, but some sincere thought was put into the list and the result is a spectacular night's worth of excellent brew sampling.  Well done!  It would be nice if they had 12-year Yamazaki single malt to really put the cherry on top of their Japanese theme (even Benihana has that), and that would probably double my frequency of visits, but I guess they have plenty of the ordinary mid to top shelf liquors.   \n\n4.25 star ambience/decor.  Dark and modern.  Just how I like it. \n\n4 star sushi/sashimi:  Our party of six tried about six rolls.  Nothing was left on the plates when we were done.  I found the quality to be high, but the execution and taste forgettable.  My wife would certainly disagree - she had the \""""Senorita Roll\"""" on her mind for many days after we went there, and she went back again 2x over the span of 2 weeks just to get it.\n\n4.25 star dishes and appetizers:  The spicy riblets are INSANE.  One would think that a chef would be a bit fearful of putting something out that is so intentionally overcooked and brittle...but it works!  And I think that is what is special about Moto...the menu has a nice dash of daring, unconventional twists on what could have been (and often is) just very ordinary fare at other places.  \n\nPS - the portion sizes of some dishes (like yakisoba) are HUGE - two people could easily be satisfied by one entree here, so if you attend with a group, don't be afraid to \""""underorder\"""" a bit and to share it family-style."""
"1,""Here's the thing... shortly after being seated the waitress spilled an entire pint glass of water DIRECTLY in my lap.  She was extremely embarassed and very apologetic, and I was good natured about the incident because after all, it was just water.  However, what bothered me was the fact that no manager or lead came to the table to apologize or at least buy me a beer.  There are three people at my table cleaning up ice and water, and an hour later I leave your restaurant STILL wet and you can't take a moment to address the situation? It left a bad taste in my mouth.  In addititon, the happy hour menu is rather limited and the sushi isn't bad, but not memorable either.  I'd much rather do happy hour at Ra or some other more consistant establishment."""
"1,""Stopped in here for lunch one day and wasn't pleased with the experience. The rolls were warm and fell apart. The service was fair at best and the place wasn't even very busy.

I told them that part of my order was COLD and they said they would not replace it because it was what I ordered and there  was nothing wrong with the food it was just cold.  The manger or what they hired as a manger said she could reheat my food  and to replace it would cost them money to replace it. I asked  for a refund and she was NOT going to give me my money back.

"1,""Either they need to hire more baristas or they need to work in faster pace.  I ordered a very simple drink and waited for over 5 minutes for it.  It was also during evening rush hours, but that shouldn't be the reason why my drink took a long time to make.  Not impressed at all."""
"1,""I brought my mini schnauzer here  for grooming and I was not at all impressed. I had been here once before and everything turned out really well, but something clearly has changed. My appt was for 8am and I was there right on time only to find the doors still locked and no employee in sight. When the person finally arrived he asked how I wanted her cut to look and I specifically explained that they can trim her beard but should, for the most, part leave it long...she's a schnauzer, he confirmed and told me she would be ready in 2-3 hours. Not too bad I thought, although last time it literally only took an hour, but I decided I would go across the street to sbux and relax while I waited. Fast forward 4 hours and I still had not received a call to let me know my dog was done. I decided at that point to go back and check to see what her status was. Upon arriving the lady grooming her told me she would need an additional 20-25 min, so again I waited and we left about 30 min later. I noticed at that point Gigi's beard was a little too short for my liking but figured it would grow. It wasn't until I got home and really looked at her that I noticed her beard was completely crooked...wth?! and they left two huge knots of matted fur on the underneath part of her tail. Granted the rest of her cut looked great, but what the heck were you doing for an additional 2 hours with my dog....with that amt of time she shouldve looked perfect. I will not be back to Poochie's ever again."""
"2,""I want to review the salon there, particularly Kristina.  When I walked in, I told her that she could do whatever she wanted to with my hair, and just gave her a few basic guidelines.

She is not the super chatty or gossipy type, which is fine with me - though I know some want that from their stylist.  Also, she is not as good with color as she is with cutting, but with suggestions from the other stylists my color turned out great as well."""

Sometimes I like to just sit in quiet and be alone with my thoughts.  She allowed me that space while still giving me pertinent information.\n\nThe only thing is that I would have liked to know up front what all the extras would have cost.  Shame on me for not asking though.\n\nI already prebooked another appt with Kristina, that's how happy I am with my cut."""

To this day, not one of them has ever offered to help me when I go to the store. They stare at me when I walk by but continue chattering away to each other, or seek out the one blonde in the store.

"2,""Matt and I dined here for our Christmas Eve dinner. Since this was the first time I didn't make the trip home to San Francisco for Christmas, I had absolutely no idea what to do with my Christmas Eve. Matt and I need plans! Therefore, after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve, I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday. Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!! I will unquestionably be back. \n\nI started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that wasn't too sweet. I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started. \n\nFor my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!\n\nI wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic. I loved the decorations that they had up for Christmas, and I highly recommend dining here for any holiday. They really do an all around excellent job at providing an awesome dining experience. \n\nWhen I was there I also noticed that they have a really nice bar with an even nicer happy hour... so once I get the chance, I'm going to head right back here and try it out!

"2,""Let me start out by saying that my ONLY critique and the ONLY reason I didn't give them five stars, is I made reservations on Open Table and because of a lot of people lingering in the restaurant, they put us in the bar.  But, I have to say that really turned out to be not a bad thing as our server was excellent, the food was excellent and the wine was smooth and wondeful.  I had their 16th St short rib stew (and kuddos that you have a small portion option) and it was scrumptious.  I practically licked the plate and you always know its a winner when I don't offer to have anyone taste my dish.  It had been a long time since we were there and I doubt if it will be a long time before we go back."""

"2,""First things First...\n\n\nLOCATION: \n\nCamelback Barber Shop is not easy to find if you don't know where you're going. It's located in the Camelback Colonnade shopping center.

I can't help you.\n\nThe rest of the story:\n\nPrior to today, I've had one haircut in Phoenix. It was in Arcadia and the place was okay, but I just wasn't feeling it. A lot of the places I found in the Arcadia/Biltmore area were just too hoity toity based on the pics I saw. And pricey. Then I noticed some of my Yelp Phx compadres had been to this Camelback Barber Shop. All of them with good things to say. \n\nI walked in and it definitely isn't pretentious by any definition of the word. If you want eye candy or upscale, this is not the place for you. I think it was very comfortable. My barber Alex was friendly. We made some small talk, including comments about the episode of Pawn Stars that was playing on TV. I can't stand that show...\n\nTelevision show preferences aside though, I would like to say that I have found my new barber shop! The cut I got here was better than the previous And it cost a little less. I actually think Alex may have done the cleanest and most detailed straight razor work that I've ever had. I look dapper."""

"2,""Although this running store is not in the most convenient location for us, my husband and I would drive across town to get fitted for running shoes. We tried a few other places for fittings, but this place seemed to do the best job and have employees with the most expertise. \n\nWhen I first decided to try running, I went to a bigger store and ended up with shoes that were way too tight and just not a good fit. A few months later, I tried this place and was really pleased with how thorough they were. Your first running shoe fitting can be a little awkward (I don't really like people around my feet anyway), but they made it very comfortable and easy and I loved the shoes they recommended. I probably paid more than other more discounted places, but I would rather pay a little more for good foot health and a better running experience.\n\nOverall, a great place to be fitted for running shoes whether you're just starting out or have been running for a long time."""
"1,""I truly love Indian food and I wanted to like this place more, but I ultimately couldn't. I wound up at the lunch buffet and didn't think too much of it. The dishes at the buffet really lacked the oomph that I am so used to at Indian restaurants, and unless the pot was personally stirred, some of the dishes were room temperature. As far as pricing, it wasn't too bad"
"2,""I don't know what they've done, but this place has SERIOUSLY improved their food over the past year. I was wary to try it again since the first time I went (yes, over a year ago) it was less-than mediocre.

I forced myself to go here and am now completely ecstatic that there's an indian food joint I can walk to, gorge myself, and roll my arse home. \n\nThe menu is standard, but somehow a little better because they offer dishes that have subtle differences.

I don't claim to be an indian foodie, but I do know that the vegetarian dishes have subtle differences so I think some places omit the dishes that are similar and just hope that people who come in order the thing that's closest to the thing they really wanted. There's one dish I always order - paneer (tikka) masala, that some places don't have so I order the closest thing to it, and of course I can't remember it right now but it's another paneer dish with a tomato base that's similar. The thing that's awesome about this place is that it has BOTH, as well as other dishes that other restaurants sometimes don't put on the menu.

"1,""Mediocre, unsatisfying and barely average!\n\nI joined a friend recently on a Friday night and the entire meal was barely passable. The calamari was uninspired and bland, just sauteed with a thin red sauce and a few frozen peas. Hardly inspiring. The 4 bruschetta were good, with interesting touches like honey and chicken liver, but another tasted like it had plain old strawberry jam on top of mascarpone cheese? \nThe fettucini carbonara was exceptionally bland and lacked the classic ingredients in abundance like it should including peas. Did they end up in the calamari by mistake ?  \n\nThe house recommended fresh tagliatelle with bolognese sauce was sad and uninspired and poorly prepared and presented. Really, as a Chef, I found the dish lacking any depth, including the unseasoned meat sauce (6 different meats in the sauce according to the owner, but still lacking any depth, flavor or significant interest). The sauce was mixed into the noodles already and looked very amateurish and very cafeteria-like. A real disappointment overall.   \n\nThe prices are actually a bit expensive for a strip mall and poor quality. Plastic cups for water, paper napkins for dinner service and piccolo pours of a limited wine selection only added to the lack of value. \n\nWill definitely not return.

"1,""I don't understand why anyone likes this place.  I ordered the fresh pasta and found it heavy and tasteless.   It is also very expensive considering for what I paid here I can dine in much better places.  I find the Food Network sign on the outside a little tasteless also."""
"2,""This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants that reminds me a lot of the little Italian family style restaurants you can find in little Italy and other places around NYC. I come here about 3-4 times a month to get my Italian fix:) The staff is super friendly and treats you like your family. The owner, Richard, is often there and loves to talk so get ready for a great conversation about the history of the restaurant etc!  Its a very small restaurant and seating is limited. I personally like sitting inside because its warm and cozy! There is outside seating but it looks out onto a shopping center parking lot which to me is not appealing to me at all. The food here is AMAZING! Portions are quite large and can easily be spit in half to share. They have been on the TV show Diner, Drive-ins and Dives, which is where I got my motivation to make the drive over there. I would recommend the calamari to start and/or the bruschetta, which offers 4 choices of toppings. For the main course I always get the Spagetti Neri, which is squid ink pasta with a TON of seafood. If you like seafood this is definitely the dish for you! The Bolognese is also an excellent choice. To top it off at the end of my meal I like to take a conolli, which is always made fresh and oh so yummy!"""
"2,""this is a newer, cleaner location.\n\ntheir agua frescas are very good. get the cheese crisp! delicious simplicity!\n\nfree chips and salsa if you dine inside!"""
"2,""Came here for afternoon tea with friends.  If you are going to splurge on the tea, you might as well pay the extra 15 dollars for unlimited sparking wine.  Geoffrey the tea sommelier will refill it as much as he refills the tea.  My favorite tea by far was his blend of coconut jasmine.  Absolutely heavenly.  I was worried that it wouldn't be enough food, but by the time the dessert course rolls around, you will be plenty full.  The scones are the best, they are served with clotted cream, raspberry jam and lemon curd.  Simply decadent and heavenly.  The piano player adds a nice touch.  A nice change of pace from the original field trip.  You are paying a bit (there is an extra \""""tea service\"""" charge on top of gratuity and tax, but well worth it."""
"1,""You, sir, are not a Ritz-Carlton. When I first walked in, it impressed. It had tasteful, old school decor and helpful people at every turn. The problems started when one of the people in our party had his card declined at check-in (not for the room cost because those were already covered, but for the incidentals). I am told that this decline was not his fault and I would certainly believe him as this is not the type of man who runs up his credit cards. Either way, the hotel staff should have asked another one of us for our cards, but for some reason they just stubbornly kept trying to run the same card for 5 minutes. This was while the rest of us waited, twiddling our thumbs. Oh, yes and we were already running late so this was very annoying. Finally, a manager came over and said that they would figure it out later. Well, within 10 minutes when we were finally in our room, here comes a call on the room phone telling us to come down as soon as possible and put a card on file. Ummm, okay. And why couldn't they just ask when we were just down there???? The room did not impress and was in fact so terribly run down that even the marble in the bathroom had rusted in spots and the pipes under the sink were corroded and leaking. Really, supposed \""""Ritz-Carlton\""""? But here it is, people. Probably the most rude thing that I have ever experienced from a hotel W down to La Quinta: I went to the front desk to ask for a razor and shaving cream. The woman at the desk very helpfully and condescendingly directed me to the tiny gift shop closet where she said they sell it. So, here I was expecting to pay $12 for some crappy bic and a tiny bottle of foam. But no, I guess they were out of them because none was to be found. When I came out of the shop-closet she asked if I found it. I said no, there wasn't any in there. She replied oh, well I will see if room service can bring one to your room. Now, that's odd. When I went to my room, housekeeping was just outside the door. I asked if they might have a shaving kit and the maid rolled her eyes, dug around in her cart and handed me a \""""ritz carlton\"""" official box with a razor and tube of cream inside. For...real... What terrible, money-grubbing, uncouth service! So, yeah. Perhaps consider staying here if you like to be treated like trailer trash who is not nearly good enough for their moldy, falling apart hotel. But, then again I think there is a W nearby. Paris prices for Arkansas accommodations."""
"2,""Very expensive hotel, but very good service overall."""
"2,""A special place for me...\n\nA few years back in Seattle my fiance (then boyfriend) and I had some vouchers to McCormick's and went for our first anniversary in January and still had some left over so we went for Valentine's Day that February.  We like it so much we go there for our anniversary every year and since the first year we have always sat in a \""""snug\"""" which is a private booth with a curtain so you can have a nice quiet meal with your dining guest.\n\nThe food is always fantastic and I always leave stuffed and satisfied.  I always order seafood (usually fish) and my seafood-averted sig other usually gets steak.  I think it can be romantic if you're dining in the snugs, but if you're out with the rest of the diners it's just another nice dining room and can be a little on the loud side.  We have no complaints and will continue the anniversary dinners and more.\n\nTheir happy hour is fantastic.  The drink specials aren't anything to write home about, but the food is worth the trip.  The burger seems to always be around and I recommend the fish tacos if they show up as well.  I've never had any bad meals and the ever-changing menu keeps us coming back for more.  I've had many, many desserts and they are all fantastic.  The creme brulee is a solid choice and the flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce is as sinful and decadent as it sounds.  The wine list is somewhat short when it comes to \""""by the glass\"""" offerings, but I never have a problem finding one I like.\n\nAnother little-known perk is their Preferred Guest Membership.  You are awarded points for every dollar you spend.  If you are a frequent visitor like myself, then it's worth it.  Otherwise, it could take far too many happy hours to rack up enough points for anything substantial.  The best part - it's free.  Details are on their website.\n\nI've also been to two other locations in Seattle and Bellevue and have had great experiences there as well.  Eat, drink, repeat!"""
"1,""Blow it out. The party's over. This candle has flickered and the flame has gone out. Wax on. Wax off. Closed. And for anyone who caught my stand up, yes indeed, I have purchased tapered candles here."""
"2,""When I first moved to Phoenix, I was walking around the Esplanade and saw this place.  I had lived in NYC for years and had lived on Mercer street where there was a \""""Merc Bar\"""" so thought I would go in and see if there was any connection.  Sure enough, this place is the 2nd location of the NYC Merc Bar.  Since I live across the street I come here fairly regularly.  I'm usually a wine or beer drinker and my only critique would be the limited selection of draft beers and very small wine list.  To their credit, their three beer tap usually has both Stella and Guinness, two of my favorites.  Nonetheless, I still have not found a wine there that I really love.  Not many people realize that they do make some excellent cheese plates if you need to snack on something.  And the bar always has both goldfish and pretzels.  If you are on a date, the really great thing is that you can grab a cozy table in the back and talk if you don't want to deal with the bar scene."""
"1,""Beautiful place, nice ambiance. Ok drinks. Music could be better. The waitress was dressed very provocatively (large breasts falling out of the top of her dress- showing her panties each time she bent over- which was often)- it appeared that many ladies on dates felt uncomfortable, arms crossed immediately with the men looking at the ground... Probably more uncomfortable for the guys really- because one wrong glance or blink and that date is over! \n\nIf this is the vibe Merc Bar is going for then... well done I guess.  I will say, it is awkward when a girls large boobs are coming out of her top and she keeps bending down with her chest in your date's face... kudos to her for being an attractive young lady, but it's a bit much when it makes the guests uncomfortable. \n\nAlso,  as one woman left her table to use the restroom, I watched the waitress flirt and stroke her husband's arm up and down as she gave him the check... I have a feeling if the wife saw that.... well, I'm happy she didn't, because you just don't know how people are gonna react to that disrespectful, intrusive behavior. It knocked the place down a couple notches- not quite Hooters vibe or strip club lounge- Maybe Champagne room? I really did wonder if I got up to use the restroom, would this girl come over to feel my guy up too? I didn't like that one bit. It wasn't a good feeling to have out with your significant other- and unfortunately, this is the memory I so strongly took away. Then again, it was also interesting watching the guy that somehow ended up on a date with a transexual squirm in the corner as she insisted on playing with his hair and trying to kiss on his neck... That must have been an internet date, lol!\n\nAlso, regarding the service, each time we would ask questions about the drinks the waitress would have to go ask the bartender. It's a specialty cocktail lounge- we aren't liquor micro-biologists asking for a chemical analysis of their concoctions- just regular basic questions. It would have been nice if she would have had some level of knowledge and training- given the niche and price points. \\ \n\nAll in all- I remember when this place was hot, back in the day- when I don't think I was even old enough to drink. It's still a nice place, but there are so many more options in this town now. Urbanity in Phoenix is progressing- gotta keep up with the times Merc Bar. When my barista knowns more about the soymilk in my Latte than this chick knows about a fresh squeezed lemon in a cocktail we have an issue. \n\nAs for the drinks... They were okay. I wasn't blown away by the choices. We ended up going to Sidebar afterwards- I love their muddled blueberrry whiskey sour- house made. Delicious! The drinks were better at Sidebar and the vibe was a little more modern less stripclub/2001 Scottsdale nightclub.\n\nSorry Merc."""
"2,""The food at this CPK is pretty good.  I guess you could say that for any of the CPKs, but they always do a nice job at this location and are very accommodating of any special requests.  I realize for the relatively low price you pay, you're not getting top-of-the-line cuisine, but it's a great for what it's intended.\n\nThe one negative thing I'd say is skip the wine list.  As you can imagine at a strip-center type chain restaurant, it's not exciting, although the staff actually seem to have a good idea of wine pairing in general for those who are new to wine.  I don't drink beer but have been told by fellow guests the beer selection is decent.\n\nThe service at this CPK is pretty good.  There are actually a few servers there that always remember me, even down to what I like to eat, even when it's been six months since I've last been in.  It's very impressive that they remember me and the staff in general (save the host staff when it's busy) is very pleasant."""
"2,""We had to stop by the Apple store to replace my phone so we decided to head to CPK for lunch. It's been quite sometime since my boyfriend and I both had been to one so it sounded like a good idea.\n\nWe got seated right away as it was just lunch time on a Sunday and it wasn't to busy. We were instantly helped and our server took our drink orders. He also asked if we wanted bread and oli which we declined (as we knew we'd be eating enough carbs). He promptly brought us our drinks and what I loved about it I ordered a flavored ice tea to which he suggested me trying before adding any sweetener in it as they use syrup to make the flavors. It was perfect as is. My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni pizza and the waiter wanted to make sure he was okay with the oregano and spicy pepperoni they now use (which he was), I had the chicken tequila fettuccine w/extra cilantro. As he was putting in the order he turned to just confirm I wanted extra cilantro which I did. \n\nThe manager brought our food over in less than 10 minutes and it was perfect! About 1/4 of the way down on my ice tea our server brought me another one. \n\nThe server asked if we wanted any desert which we were stuffed anyways. My boyfriend and I both said this was one of the best service we had received from any restaurant in a long time. As we left my boyfriend mad a point to tell the manager how great the service was."""

"1,""I took my Bassett hound in on Wednesday 11/7/12 she has something wrong with her left eye looked greyish. They did no testing and gave her drops for possibly being bitten, by Saturday morning the eye was almost completely grey and I took her back the doctor came in didn't even look into her eyes and said it has to be Valley Fever and needed to do blood work but started treatment on Saturday and would call when the results came in. She acted like I was wasting her time by asking questions about Valley Fever. I just moved to Arizona and had never heard of it. So we did blood work and more medicine and off we go. By Tuesday afternoon I get the call saying quit giving her the pills for Valley Fever and take her to the Eye dr for animals it must be glaucoma and they can't help. So, after $300.00 with them and another $300.00 for the eye dr YES she does have glaucoma and is blind in the eye  I believe they possibly could have saved her sight if she had been diagnosis properly"""
"2,""Ate here for dinner during the week while staying at the hotel.\nFor an appetizer had house made potato chips with bleu cheese.  Waiter said the bleu cheese was also house made.

Up there with the top half dozen, at least.  I travel and eat a lot of steaks, so this is saying something.  Had a loaded baked potato on the side. \nService was fine.  Attentive, knowledgeable.  No complaints.\nAmbiance was fine for a hotel restaurant."""
"2,""In today's economy where most businesses try to provide the least and charge the most, I feel that it is necessary to give credit where credit is due.  Thus, I'd like to give a shout out to Hyde Park Jewelers in Phoenix, and specifically, Quinton V, one of their sales associates.  Quinton made the engagement ring and wedding band purchasing process extremely easy and very low pressure.  He is very well informed and was great at teaching me all about diamonds.  He spent an hour with me the first time I walked in the store and never pressured me into buying anything or spending more than I wanted.  I ended up with the perfect engagement ring.  Fast forward five months and we went back into the store to buy bands.  Again, Quinton was very easy to work with, put us both at ease, and provided us with several options that fit our budget.  We walked out less than an hour later with the perfect band as well.  I appreciate businesses that go the extra mile to make sure that customers are happy with their purchasing decisions and take the time to inform them without pressuring them during the process.  If you are looking for a quality jewelery store without the high pressure sales environment, go to Hyde Park and ask for Quinton.  You won't be disappointed."""

"1,""\""""Hey, Kerstin! Why are you eating a grilled cheese for dinner? Didn't you just eat out?\""""\n\n\""""Yeah, but we ate at Miracle Mile.\""""\n\n'Nuf said, really, but our experience was such an epic fail, I must elaborate a bit. This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.\n\nI got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager \""""saved\"""" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. \""""Why don't you like caraway?\"""" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, \""""I really don't like the taste.\"""" When she asked me \""""Why?\"""" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the \""""sauce\"""" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that \""""real\"""" texture. Foul, foul, foul. \n\nHence, the grilled cheese."""
"1,""Nah. I forked over $13 for a club sandwich, mac 'n' cheese, and a large Pepsi.  The mac 'n' cheese was good, and the sandwich was just okay.  I say take your $13 and go to Texaz Grill!!!  WAY better food, and for $13 you can get dessert too."""

"1,""Before I jump into this review, let me just preface it by saying that I'm really not a fan of chain restaurants (Chipotle, Jersey Mike's and Yogurtland excluded). And in my opinion, the Cheesecake Factory embodies everything I hate about chain restaurants. \n\nRight off the bat, our server was rude and disinterested. And every time he visited the table next to us, he stood between their table and ours, with his behind right in our faces. He was incredibly slow in delivering drinks (we only ordered iced tea) and only came by to refill once. \n\nI ordered the Evelyn's Favorite pasta which was surprisingly one of the few vegetarian items on the menu (aside from salads). My only request was to take off the Kalamata olives. Of course, when the food was delivered, it was chock-full of olives. So not only did the pasta lack flavor to start with, but the small amount of flavor that I was able to detect was ruined by the olives. I'm not a complainer, and I hate sending food back, so I picked as many out as I could, but it wasn't really worth salvaging. I mostly just pushed the pasta around my plate, took a few bites, and pushed it aside, which is disappointing since it's a $13 bowl of pasta. \n\nWhen the bill finally arrived, it added up to just under $50 for two iced teas, one bowl of pasta and one cobb salad. I'm sorry, but that price is just absolutely exorbitant for the poor service and lack luster food. This visit was most definitely my last visit to the Cheesecake Factory. And if you happen to be looking for dinner at the Biltmore, I would suggest you stop ANYWHERE else."""

At 7:30, an hour and a half AFTER we asked for our check the first time, we had to walk up to the front, wait in line, and ask the manager AGAIN for our check. He apologized and brought it right out. Instead of offering to comp the meal, or ANYTHING, he took the coffee off. Really? Oh thank you for saving me $2.95. I waited an hour and a half to pay you guys. Needless to say, we left a $0 tip.

"2,""Maybe it was a matinee viewing of \""""Get Him To the Greek\"""" last weekend. No matter how it happened, I have been all about Greek food the last few days. Following up my delicious gyro feta on Tuesday, I decided to try out Cyprus Grill, right around the corner from my stomping grounds. The place is right next to Trader Joe's, so I am not sure how I missed it before tonight. Walking in, Cyprus has a smallish set-up with hardwood floors and some outside seating (with misters, thankfully). \n\nI was immediately greeted by the hostess/cashier/etc with a huge smile, which always lets me know I made a good choice. With all of the complaints about customer service on Yelp, I would think more restaurants would train their staff right, and Cyprus certainly has do so. From an earlier Yelp review, I knew exactly what I wanted: the Spartan Club (a pita sandwich with grilled chicken, gyro meat, lettuce, tzatziki, feta, and hot sauce) with greek fries. My new friend offered an upsize in fries, but they were bad enough as a side, so I was fine with the normal order. After about 8-10 minutes, I was on my way.\n\nSimply put, the sandwich is fantastic. I love pita bread, and this was soft and tasty, but strong enough so it wasn't breaking with the weight of the sandwich. The chicken was excellent, if not overcooked just a touch, and the gyro meat was as good as any I have had. The tzatziti sauce was lighter than I like, but it and the feta certainly added to the meal. The one issue I had with the sandwich was my own fault. The hot sauce seemed like a strange addition for it, and even though it added a little bite, it eventually overcame the Spartan. Don't get me wrong, it tastes great, but I would probably go without the hot sauce next time.\n\nThe Greek fries were fantastic as well. Sometimes with Greek fries, the lemon overcomes the rest of the meal, but it was a perfect compliment to the melted feta and seasoning.\n\nAll in all, another great Greek meal and well worth the solid price you pay for it."""

When we arrived at 7:45 we still had to wait in the bar until 8:30 (lame again).  The place (at least bar area..never saw the actual restaurant) was very pretty and dimly lit.  I liked it alot.  We ordered one well vodka martini and and Knob Hill and coke that came to $18.00.  We finished our drinks and waited about another 10 minutes to be seated...Seated where??? Literally 3 feet behind where we we standing in the bar.  Yep!

"1,""I purchased the Living Social deal for 6 pedicures- it was a great deal. \nI realized right away that it would be difficult to complete the deal as they get booked up 3 weeks in advance, and the deal expires 6 months after it was purchased.

How can you expect to satisfy the public if you aren't even available when the majority of people are off work??\nI must say the pedicure experience itself was amazing. The owner did my service and she is the nicest woman and she did great. She explained to me everything that was going on and we chatted for the entire 2 hour experience. Even better is how clean they are and they use plastic inside the basin so you are never using the same tub as someone else. \nI had to cancel my second appointment the day of because something came up so unfortunately I lost one of my visits- fair enough it does say that in the voucher. However I really wanted to reschedule for as soon as possible. Next available appointment- a FULL 3 WEEKS LATER. Seriously?! Keep the $70.

"1,""Let me preface this review with the fact that I'm Chinese and I know my rice.\n\nSo after a meeting next door @ Hava Jave (review for that place to follow) a friend and I wandered over to Zen32 for a 10pm snack.\n\nBoy was that a mistake.  I normally eat up at Celsius in Desert Ridge so I thought I'd get the same food down here to compare.  \n\nA couple of the rolls we ordered:\n\nViva Vegas Roll\nCaterpillar Roll\n\nThe service was just fine but honestly, even if I had Angelina Jolie serving the food naked, the food would still be crap and the rating would still be an UNO star.\n\nThe rice seemed like it was day-old rice.  It was clumpy and honestly, I don't know how a sushi chef  takes CLUMPY rice and puts it into a roll...  so anyway, due to the clumpiness of the rice, the Vegas roll was loosly rolled so it fell apart when I tried to pick it up.\n\nThe Caterpillar roll tasted super bland which is VERY hard to do because it includes so many different ingredients like eel, faux crab, avocado, cucumber, and eel sauce.  Not only did it taste bland, it was also poorly rolled.  \n\nAgain, the service was nice but you might want to bring your own sushi if you're going to eat here..."""

"1,""This restaurant is one of the filthiest I've ever visited in the entire world (and I travel frequently to third-world countries on business). During my lunchtime visit the dining room tables were strewn with uncollected plates and uneaten food, the steam table buffet had food scraps hanging all over it, and the carpeting was full of stains from ground-in food particles. If that wasn't bad enough the buffet food was terrible, too.  It all appeared to come from frozen, restaurant supply entrees--very oily stuff with poor smell, taste and appearance.  During the 30 minutes I was there, someone at another table complained about an unidentified object in her noodles, while another customer complained that the buffet was essentially empty.  This place isn't even worth the 5.99 +tax for lunch, even if it does include beverage.  YUCKERS to the core!"""

"1,""Maybe it was an off day or something for this place..  Stopped in for lunch today, it's a Saturday.  Place is in a strip mall.  Decorations are something you would see in party city around Mardi Gras time, (pretty cheesy).  Service was nice and friendly.  Now lets get down to the food part of this.  \nI'm very hesitate to say but I must, it wasn't good.. Yes I've read the other reviews but I've been and lived in New Orleans and I have to say I don't think this should be called Cajun.  The flavors are so bland I couldn't taste any spice at all on anything.  Food seemed really dry like it might have been sitting awhile.\nMy husband and I ordered the Boudin Balls for an app.  Now those were decent.  I ordered a Shrimp Po'boy, and my husband ordered the Jambalaya.  My shrimp Po'boy had old bread and was cut in half with 4 medium size shrimps on each half., sorry not enough shrimp for a sandwich that cost nearly 11 bucks at lunch.  The Remoulade sauce only had one flavor... Horseraddish, it was super strong and was awful.  So eh on the Po'boy, it came with a side of burnt homemade potato chips, ate like one and decided to pass on the plate of them.\nI felt really bad though looking at my husbands plate.  It was a stacked high rice dish with these shriveled up sausages thrown on the side of the dish.  I had a taste of his, first the rice... really dry.. Then I took a little bit of this beef jerky sausage, it was so dry and had no taste at all.  I told him he must dump hot sauce all over that dish because there is nothing going on there.  \nSo yeah.. not sure if it's what we ordered or what, but Flavors of Louisiana is way better if your craving Cajun food in the valley.\nP.S.  My husband ordered Tea, it's wasn't Louisiana Tea, nor sweet as they make it in the south... would have been nice to have been given the option for sweet tea!"""

"1,""I travel a good deal.  This is the worst hotel experience, by far.\n\nThis is an older Embassy Suites but I thought that its location in the tony Biltmore area of Phoenix would assure that it's well-kept.  Incorrect assumption.  This is the filthiest hotel I've ever seen.\n\nI should have known I was in for utter disappointment when I arrived for my stay around 12:45 am.  I am dead tired and fumbling with two bags when I happen upon a security guard standing in front of the hotel taking a smoke.  Instead of holding the door for me, he watched me balance my bags and purse with an amused grin, as I struggled with the the hotel door.  Thanks for nothing.  I get to the front desk and the check-in process is fairly smooth.  I'm booked into a room that is on a far end of the hotel.  I hike over there and proceed to get ready for bed when more problems ensue. The bathroom wall has what appears to be a streak of blood running down it.  I was too grossed out to investigate further.  There is also a bent wire hanger on the picture frame over the toilet.  The wallpaper is peeling and the ceiling is showing signs of a bad leak from upstairs.  Really?  I am appalled at this point but since it's after 1 am, I reason that I can just get a little shut-eye and change rooms first thing in the morning.  My plans quickly changed when I turned down the bed covers to find lint and make-up on them.  I can't do this.  I call the front desk and request an immediate room change.  The lady I spoke too was extremely apologetic and offered to move me right away.  She said she'd send up a security guard to help with my bags and get me into a better room/area of the hotel.  You know where this is going, right?  Yes, approximately 10 minutes later the grinning smoker appears at the door.  He hands me a key for a room on the opposite side of the hotel and makes the assessment that I have a pretty good handle on my bags so he'll just point me in the direction of where I should go.  The new room looks exactly like the first one, albeit a little cleaner.  The bathroom looked acceptable and the bed covers were free of foreign substances.  It was past my bedtime, I needed sleep.\n\nWith a little rest and fresh eyes, the hotel didn't get any better for me.  I'm sure in its heyday this was THE place to stay.  Sadly, it is just neglected and doesn't warrant the nightly room charges (it's not cheap).  The common areas are filthy.  I promise that I'm not a germaphobe.  I really didn't want to touch anything in this hotel.  The elevator buttons and door handles were dirty.  I had to carry napkins with me so I wouldn't have to touch them.  The carpet in the lobby and elevators looked like a ton of toddlers had had their way with a box of Ritz crackers.  And, no, I didn't catch them on an off day.  It looked like this for my entire three-day stay.  I failed to mention the ceiling fan in my new and improved \""""clean\"""" room.  The dust hanging off of it was so thick.  It clearly hadn't been touched in ages.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel lobby also has an off-putting stench, probably due to the fountains/ponds inside?  I don't know but it's unpleasant.\n\nIf the filth wasn't bad enough, on the last day of my stay I was jarred from sleep at 4 am by a blaring fire alarm.  I pulled the curtain back and saw other guests milling about.  Apparently, there is no intercom system to let guests know what they should do.  When I saw another guest return to her room, I took the gamble that I'd burn in this cess pool and went back to bed.  It was a short-lived nap.  A few hours later, the alarm is blaring again!  I'm deliriously tired and in the process of the pulling on a pair of jeans to exit when housekeeping opens the door.  Really?  The alarm is going off,  it's still early in the a.m. and you're coming in the room to clean?  What in the hell?  What do you clean, anyway?  At this point, I knew it was time to part ways.  I quickly packed and made my exit.  Unbelievable and unforgivable.  Never again."""
"1,""It's almost comical how bad this place is. It's all been said before me, but here's just some of what makes this a horrible place to stay. \n\n1) no AC. I came in January so no REAL need for it except that both rooms I had were set to 80 degrees at check in and it took forever to cool down with the warm air just circulating. \n\n2) absolutely and completely filthy. There were crumbs on the furniture and rando hairs all over the bathroom in both rooms I tried. 2nd room smelled like 20 years of smoking have been going on. \n\n3) The phones in my 2nd room didn't work very well and when I finally got to my messages it was just a sales pitch from Embassy Suites. \n\n4) elevators are unbelievably slow. Prepare to wait. \n\n5) fridge in my first room was so loud I could hear it in the bedroom with the door closed and tv on. \n\n6) stupid \""""automatic\"""" deadbolts. When I'm staying in a 3rd world hotel like this I'd really like the satisfying click of an actual deadbolt to let me know the door is secure. \n\nIn summation, this place is just awful."""
"2,""Kinda dumpy, and not entirely in an endearing, it's-an-almost-hundred-year-old-place kinda way.  Service was ok-ish, music terrible (live music Friday nights - not a fan myself).  This place gets 4 stars for the food.  Burger and fries.  Epic win.  Burger with bacon, dried apples (??? I know, right?!) and a huge gob of blue cheese on an english muffin.  Fries were awesome, too, served with a giant cuppa ketchup.  Burger was slightly overdone, unsure whether there was ordering confusion or what happened (I shared the burger w/ a friend, we both agreed it was awesome despite unfortunate well-doneness).  I liked my drink, I paid 15.50 for two of em which is a pretty good deal.  \n\nAll-in-all, a surprisingly accessible yet highly unique place - offbeat.  Seems like it needs a look at the details - a fresh coat of paint, so to speak.  I'm totally coming back here when I need a place with character.  I'm psyched about getting the food here again, too."""
"2,""I thought this place rocked.\n\nWe made dinner reservations for a Friday night for a table with a view.\nWe were in the inside portion of the mansion with a large party.\n\nThe food was great, views were great, drinks were great.\nMy favorite part was being handed a glass of sparkling wine as we entered.  Yay!\n\nAfter dinner we explored the house.  Then we moved to the lounge and found a very, very entertaining and maybe drunk lounge singer (think of the band at the end of the Hangover movie)\n\nI would definitely return for a fancy brunch or special night out."""
"1,""It's a bad feeling when you walk away from a restaurant feeling that you've been ripped off. It can spoil the experience when you are focused on what you paid, and not on enjoying the savory feeling of the food in your mouth.\n\nMy wife and I, at the Wrigley Mansion for my birthday, couldn't believe that this place is racking up a high average review. It was unbelievably bad. The food was marginal -- so marginal that we wondered, are we in the same restaurant that these others reviewed? And the \""""deal\"""" that we went in with . . .  wow, what a loser. We had a Travelzoo prepaid voucher, which was supposedly worth $120. That voucher was for an appetizer, a soup or salad, and an entree. According to them, this voucher would pay for food for two that would at its normal price be valued at $120. And they base their add-on gratuity on this inflated figure, as well as the tax.\n\nWhat did we get? The appetizer was a one or two bite item -- two one-bite crab cakes, the size of quarters, and a teacup with one escargot in the bottom of it (our choices). The bowl of soup was actually a teacup as well. The entree we both had was a salmon, a very small filet, and when one of us expressed a concern about an allergy, they took the side dish away that contained the allergen and didn't replace it with anything. Most restaurants would have a baked potato or something to substitute. \n\nWe ended up paying, after they added the gratuity in and the taxes based on the inflated retail price, nearly $120 for this dinner for two that included only two drinks, a well drink with house rum and a house cabernet.  That was our \""""voucher deal\"""" price. That's absurd . . . the Salmon dinner could be had in a larger portion in any restaurant in town for $18-24. The cup of soup perhaps $5-7 and the microscopic \""""tasting\"""" of an appetizer would be a courtesy item or certainly no more than a few $$. How does this equate to what we paid?\n\nWhile the views are nice at the Wrigley Mansion and the place itself is unique, this operation is using it as an excuse to gouge. Don't visit this establishment -- seriously, like many others, you will regret it. Stay as far away as you can from Geordie's. Spend your money at innumerable restaurants with better value in other parts of Phoenix. (The night before we spent $50 at St. Francis and it was incredible)."""

I called Lori and she admitted to the accidentally cutting her nails to short and I'm not one to be an ass but why wouldn't she tell me before I took my dog home where I have a very well taken care of white antique couch? Her unprofessional attitude and smart remarks not to mention very dirty waiting area taught me not to be so quick to trust just anyone with my pooch. The least she could have done was tell me what happened before going home or was it perhaps it was the $12 tip she was afraid id take back well I'll never know because I'll never return to have my dog done there again and I say you don't either.

"1,""This location certainly draws a large lunch crowd.  I was there with my son yesterday at about 12:30 and the place was packed.

I did see some setting to the side that had leftover food residue from the last guest sitting to the side...I'm not counting those.

I did, unfortunately, have one bad experience with the woman they have working there Mon, Tues, Wed. mornings, she was not pleasent or welcoming in any sort of way, and honestly made me feel like I was rather inconveniencing her by being there. I was SO shocked by the whole experience since I've been going in pretty regularly for a couple months now and had never had anything negative to say, until then. I remember thinking, \""""Geez, I sure hope that's NOT Barb, and if it is, perhaps she's best suited for strictly baking...in the back...as far away from customers as possible!\"""" LOL\n\nSo, I do definitely recommend Barb's for cake and cookie lovers alike, you will DEFINITELY score big points with friends, family and co-workers!!

"1,""It was faster than a Filibertos. Which means, their stuff is probably all frozen and just deep-fried before serving. \n\nI've been here for lunch a couple times and its OK at best. I mean, cheap, fast, Mexican food and its close by. Chips and salsa are okay. I usually order off  their lunch menu and went with a lunch-sized chimi. \n\nOur food came out so fast. I think it took us 20 minutes to have lunch since the food came out so quick. I cut open my chimi and noticed a lot more \""""juice\"""" in it than normal and when forked some of the shredded beef out of the chimi to have a taste, it was kind of gamey. \n\nI've had better experiences here but today's lunch made me gag and I never do that! =)"""

"1,""WORST FOOD EVER. Don't waste a cent at this place. Staff was good and chips and salsa weren't bad but the entree was terrible. First you couldn't even tell what you were eating. Second the price was way to high for the quality of food. Third the food made me and my girlfriend sick all night and the next morning. Also you can eat at much better mexican food places for the same price. Blanco at the Biltmore for example."""
"2,""The Dogg says. Muy bien Manuel's.  It's the Sonoran style type of comida Mexicano that is prevalent in AZ.   My taco was full of shredded beef and had good flavor. It was also stuffed full of lettuce tomato onions and cheese. My tostada was very crispy the beans tasted homemade and was one of the best tostadas I've ever had. Manuel's has one of the most tastiest salsas in the state. You can actually get full eating just chips and salsa with a beer and use your dinner as a partial appetizer and lunch for the next day. I miss the 32nd St. and Indian school location! But this one on 28th street has also been very good. Great service. Good food for the money.

She said that we did it, even though they gift wrap the box and we didn't even touch it after buying it and it was brought back the same day!\n\nDespicable store. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Blatant fraudsters won't even give you any service. I will not let this go lightly."""
"1,""Hey Gabi M. wish we could agree. On our recent visit there, it became such a comedy of errors that they actually comp'd the entire meal.\n\nA+ for design and architecture, nobody appreciates a fine terrazzo in the bathroom like we do, but D+ for food and service. \n\nHaving said that, it is Hillstone (Houston's) and the one thing they are best known for is their impeccable consistency. \n\nWe are more than confident that they will pull it together in short order and continue to succeed in their real business -- printing money."""
"2,""This just in: Houstons is on steroids! Yup, it's true. \n\nIf you're familiar with Houston's you're familiar with Hillstone. But, Hillstone is better in my opinion.

We had the mango salmon roll - delicious). \n-No need to worry about Valet... lots of parking. \n-Great service.\n\nWhat hasn't changed is the menu and the crowd. Still your 40+ real estate suits - or should I say jeans + a blazer - and all the cougary women that come along with these men... Not knocking it, simply the truth.\n\nOverall, a great place for a good American meal, people watching or to take your parents.

"1,""We had dinner at Hillstone a couple nights ago.  The food was, for the most part, pretty good.  However, the service was below average.  They really need to work on training their servers better or they will lose a lot of potential repeat business.   We showed up at 7:30 and our reservation was for 8pm.  We seated ourselves on the outdoor patio (which was very nice as far as scenery/ambience).  It was awhile before a server came over to take our drink orders"

This Britax B-Ready apparently warranted a scolding.  Carol was so incredibly rude and my stroller would have easily fit at a table- minus a chair.  What exactly is their procedure for wheelchairs or other special needs devices?  Do they simply not fit or are they not pleasing enough to the eye to accommodate?  They might want to come up with a better story and take a more discerning eye to the host staff.  I've always had such great experiences here in the past"

"1,""Only the Biltmore Apple Store can make the typical shopper (me) feel like a total douche just by walking inside of it to be exposed to the cultish behaviors of Apple fanboys and girls.

Thanks genius.  Thanks for keeping up the good fight vs Microsoft, dweeb.\n\nAnd thanks for allowing me to check out -- not at the cashwrap, but right here, where we stand -- amongst the packed section of iPhones, where people are dorking out to these things.  I appreciate the dapper service, even though I'm plopping down the loot for two 'pods (which will inevitably be returned for two new ones in a few short months after I stump the geniuses over at the bar).  \n\nNow, I'm just blue-skying here, but how about you treat me like an actual human customer instead of an ATM machine, given that I've purchased 6 or so Apple products within the past 4 years?   \n\nI hate that Apple has been crushing the portable music market for several years now because their outposts for customer service are absolutely abysmal."""
"1,""I understand when a store is busy, every patron cannot get the attention they may need. However, I had questions about transferring my old MacBook Pro to an external hard drive so that when I purchased a new laptop, (which would've been today) I could have access to all of my old documents. I had an issue with my Apple ID,  so I was unable to make a Genius Bar appointment. I stopped by anyway to see if I could get some quick advice from one of the 12 kids doing nothing but standing around in blue shirts. I was promptly told there was no appointments and maybe I should drive to another store. No inquiry about my questions, no offer of any service at all. I was simply sent away, brushed off, told to go elsewhere. Ok, I mean I'll find another store that wants my business. I'm sure the 15 other people wandering around aimlessly touching every device in the store were about to make major purchases too...."""
"2,""Incredibly busy and crowded, but a great store still. \n\nSo I began my relationship with this Apple store location in 2007 when I bought a MacBook. They have serviced it accordingly, giving me several keyboards (when they were proven to be faulty), helping me on upgrades (including sending me elsewhere to save money), and showing me other products, like the iPhone and iPad, which I would eventually buy. \n\nThe Genius Bar is a good place to get help. I've been here several times and each time they were pretty quick and usually inexpensive. A couple of times they took longer but overall I am happy with the results. I've spent some money at this store for sure. Fixing issues with my computer, buying new devices, and getting accessories have all been things I've done at this Apple store. \n\nMy only true gripe about this location is the fact that sometimes MANY people are shopping at the same time for devices and waiting for someone in a blue shirt to \""""open up\"""" availability can be stressful and time consuming. On several occasions I've waited and waited only to be told that everyone is busy and they'll \""""get to me when they can\"""". \n\nDespite the long waits for service and for help with new devices (sometimes), I would still rate this location pretty well overall. The parking structure is covered and there is usually decent parking to be had, the employees are friendly and knowledgable, and turnaround time for service is pretty quick. Overall, I'm happy with Apple and their store on Camelback in the Biltmore."""
"1,""This is by far the worst Apple Store I have ever been too. The customer service is AWFUL, I have never dealt with such unprofessional people. After being told my computer was broken, I waited 45 minutes even though I told them the exact computer I wanted to buy. I was willing to pay $2,000 upfront to get the computer I needed. When it came time to purchase it, I let them know I needed it ASAP since I had to make it to class. At this point, they told me it would be ANOTHER 30 minutes for me to even get the computer!!!! Not to mention, I dealt with a total witch while trying to explain I had been at the store already for 45 minutes waiting to get this computer. I will probably never return to this store, as I don't appreciate having eyes rolled at me and employees tell me I'm being unreasonable."""
"1,""Not enough personnel to support the customer. Appointments don't mean nothing here. Still got seen late and I have a guy looking at my comp and another comp at the same time. Personnel hygiene is non existent for the Apple employees."""

Alright, I guess I could sacrifice and eat this delicious chocolate cake and free cookies you put in my valeted car!\nI swear that is how it is every time I dine at Vincent's.  They love providing extra treats which is why this place exceeds five stars.  The food alone is divine!  I love every item on their menu!  The souffles are to die for as well.  But they always seem to go above and beyond every meal.  If only every restaurant had the same level of customer service!"""
"1,""Meh, is right.  I've been wanting to try Vincent's since I moved to the area over a year ago.  I bought a groupon that I've been holding onto for way to long and decided that this was a weekend to go.  Honestly can say that I could have done without. \n\nOur first impression upon walking in was old and stuffy.  I get that your a French restaurant, but no need to decorate like we're still in the 80's.  Liquor bottles as a display? Doesn't look good.  It should have felt like an upscale restaurant, but it didn't.\n\nI liked that their menu is constantly changing.  Some of their menu options were actually pretty surprising.  My husband and I probably went with the least interesting choices.  I started with the lobster bisque ($8).  For our main courses it was lobster with basil linguine for me and beef tenderloin for him.  The lobster was just ok, the basil pasta was overcooked.  Mike's beef tenderloin was pretty good, but not worth the $34 price tag.  And none of the main entrees were under $32.  I get that you're a \""""fancy\"""" restaurant, but those prices are way too high.  I have no problem spending $30 on an entree, but it better wow me.

NO, but who would expect it to be at $20 for 3 courses?  Are portions huge? NO, but you can't even get out of cheesecake factory at that price (not that I'd want 3 courses at cheesecake, but you get the idea...).\n\nUnfortunately word is getting out and it is getting more and more crowded every time I go!!

"2,""Ice House Tavern is a dive bar with character.\n\nBehind the bar is a large plexiglass wall with the Arcadia ice rink on the other side. The coolness of this is that you can sit at the bar and watch hockey or ice-skating while you drink. When we first arrived, there was a hockey game in mid-swing. There were multiple occurrences of goal shots gone wide, with a final destination of smacking against the back of the plexiglass bar wall near us. I found this to be highly entertaining, but it could definitely cause some people to get startled, so you might not want to sit directly at the bar if there is a hockey game on-going and you are easily spooked.\n\nThey've got darts, video games, plenty of seating and a good bottled beer selection. I wish they had a good micro-brew on tap, but alas, I settled for the bottle route.

Their personalized, hands-on service was evident as I watched the last few bows be tied to perfection before picking up my invites.  \nIt's always my goal to support independent small business owners but Lydia makes it so easy.  This woman and her staff are one in a million!"""

"1,""Ok, So I have lived here for almost a year...and am not renewing my lease for what I pay here I could get a nice house or town-home in the same area. I liked the area though and did not realize all the problems I would have upon moving in. My Sales Associate lied to me. I asked pretty specific questions upon moving in.  Upon moving in...I was told my Apartment was going to be a 3 bedroom on the third floor with new carpet...and paint...well when it came time to move in the apartment I was suppose to get was not ready, I had no choice because I had already vacated my last place...so they put me in another apartment, with stained carpet, shitty paint and tile and it still had furniture in it from the last tenant...and stuff in the drawers and cabinets...it had not even been cleaned and it was on the 2nd floor.\n\nHow much is the average electric bill I asked...they said no more then $200 in summer...mine has been closer to $300...nearly twice as much as what I was paying before I moved here for the same size unit.\n\n I asked how sound proof are the walls, am I going to be able to hear my neighbors...I live on the middle floor. They said I wouldn't it is a quiet complex, LIE...first night the people above me sounded like they were having a zumba class.  If you fart to loud your neighbors will probably complain...and the office will give you a ten day notice for farting to loud.\n\nThey failed to mention that the pet rent was a monthly charge not a one time fee. And this place is definitely not pet friendly, if you own a dog, and if that dog barks, don't live here...they will try to evict you every week for that one.  \n\nYou will get notices for everything.\n\nThey also did not explain that I would have to pay for water every month, which took them three months just to mail it to me. So your rent changes every month...it is never the same amount. Um...you pay the landlord the water bill not the water company...sound fishy!\n\nThis place sucks on all levels, the pictures do not do it justice, the apartments are old, the kitchen cabinets are 1990's, the fountain and grass are all gone, filled in with rocks and dirt. They landscaping sucks. Pool is ghetto, You can only get sun before 4pm otherwise it is blocked out by the buildings. And it is small, it is usually hoarded by fat people and screaming kids. And if anything breaks...it will take maintenance months to fix...because they never show up on time.\n\n The management office is a joke, no one is there to help you, they look at you like your a problem, I live in the biggest apartment they have and pay the most rent and pay on time...you think they would try to take care of a tenant like me...instead I get harassed.\n\nWorst Apartment complex ever.  Do not move in here. Move anywhere but here."""
"1,""Last night we went to spend the $150 gift certificate our daughter gave us a year ago---was not that excited to go.  Had eaten here a few times in the past but was never very impressed with the food.  And thanks to the reviews on Yelp still wasn't keen on going.  We went early to enjoy the happy hour which some had raved about.  I ordered the house martini, a vodka I had never heard of and surprisingly it was ok.  We had the tuna etutanesca, a \""""seared\"""" tuna--it WAS NOT seared but tasty, the edamame, good, and the pretzel bites with a cold cheese fondue which had to be sent back to be warmed.  Wine selection is not good---when Mirasou is on the wine menu at such an upscale restaurant you have to wonder---at least I did.  Wasn't really hungry but decided to have dinner anyway to use up the certificate.  We started with Lobster Bisque, HORRIBLE!--wrong color, did not taste any lobster and the garnish was mussel I believe.  Wanted the grilled peach salad--no peaches available--so shared the Asian Pear Salad, and still had some left over.  It was ok.  We also shared the Carbonara, tasty.  I finished off with the gelato and coffee ---good.  So with tips and the food we ended up spending $15.00 out of pocket.  I love the atmosphere but definitely will not be going back on my dime."""
"1,""My son likes to go there for poppers on the weekend.  His second choice is the chocolate chip coffee cake.  This is the second weekend in a row that they have been out of both.   The first time, I thought it was a fluke.  Two weekends in a row is a trend.  If you run out of something daily, make more of it.  Obviously, there's now more of a demand for both of these.  You can make more of them to meet the demand or don't and demand will go down from people like me not coming back to your store.  Dunkin Doughnuts, here we come again!"""

"1,""Just to entertain myself I stopped in this Ross to compare it to my favorite Ross location (Sunnyslope/Dunlap store) Just as I expected it was total bootleg up in this location. Man the place was jacked! It's larger and you find a few more or different items as a result. The prices are the same as the other location on items that both have stocked. But this place looked like it had been hit by a plane. Broken stuff, stuff on the floor, stuff falling off hangers, stuff in the wrong departments and wrong shelves. Tables in complete disarray! Bedding and pillows on the floor. Lines...OMG! What long lines! \nThe couple of items that interest me that I spotted I passed on rather than wait in these long lines. No staff on the floor offering help. One poor staff person was putting out artwork and avoiding all contact with customers. Can't say I blame her because the customers were shouting for and at their unruly children and crying babies at decibels uncalled for. I think this clerk just wanted to disappear. So when I saw items of interest without a price I just respected her by not asking for help and leaving the items where I found them. \nThe odd thing is 3 hours before I had just shopped my favorite location where all was calm, organized and with short quick moving lines! So glad there are other locations of Ross stores near by offering the same great deals."""

"1,""DO NOT GET MARRIED HERE! This resort is beautiful from the outside, but start peeling back the layers and you will see an ugly company that will nickle and dime you at every turn. My wedding experience turned from one of joy and happiness to a feeling of dread and nausea at every turn with this company.  THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW UP FRONT: Expect to pay a 22% service charge that is TAXED with the sales tax + the regular sales tax on top of your bill. Also, plan to spend $100 per bartender and be expected to tip several key people during the reception, despite the service charge. Also, plan to pay $4.00 per every car that valets at your wedding.

Instead of telling me \""""there's water inside\"""", they went in and got a fresh glass for me.

"1,""In the world of cakes, there's somehow an unspoken rule that if it's pretty, it's okay to be subpar in taste and moistness. In my world, this does not compute. It needs to be as tasty as it is pretty. Period.\n\nSo I can only give kudos to the artfulness of a Tammie Coe Cake, but nothing more. Cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it... that's not right--you should be able to eat it all--and yummily so. If you like the taste of fondant... you've got to be kidding me--Yucky!\n\nSo take my review or leave it. I just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second... less of course it's for a wedding, than it needs to be both EQUALLY. Who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake? Not me. So I'm putting my foot down and saying I won't eat a cake or cupcake that isn't tasty to me.\n\nNow, I must state that I am more a fan of cake than frosting. Frosting is secondary to me. So if you are more for frosting than for cake, ignore my note and have at all the Tammie Coe's and Sprinkles of the world--and have mine... no really, go ahead.\n\nIf there IS frosting--for me and others like me, a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception: If it's Whipped Cream Frosting... then BRING IT ON! I like frosting's more subtler relative so if it's a Whipped Cream Iced cake, I won't make it a point to get an inside piece, or scrape off the icing at all as I would a basic frosted cake.\n\nAnyway, Tammie Coe's cakes or cupcakes don't do it for me. If I have to partake in one of her treats, I'd shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake.\n\nAs for MJ Bread, I have no complaints there... their breads really impressed. I can't remember which CenPho restaurant I had my first taste of MJ bread, but I remember being V E R Y impressed."""
"2,""I have loved this place for a long time.  It troubles me that people write such negative things in their reviews.  Hi, it costs money to have a credit card machine and if you don't spend over five bucks it costs the COMPANY money. Duh.   And in regards to closing early, yes, it is a bummer.  However, it would be a far greater bummer if they had to close down instead.  In an economy where businesses are disappearing left and right, they are still here.  That says a lot.\n\nThe coffee is delicious, latte art very cool and the new baked goods made in-house are absolutely to die for.  Keep up the great work guys!"""
"1,""About two months ago I needed to get waxed, and I would normally head to the Brow Lady but thought I'd give the Spa a chance, since I'm there daily already. I called in advance for an appointment. I went in and was led to the Relaxation Room by the very friendly Spa receptionist. I had arrived ten minutes early for the appointment, hoping she could take me sooner and I could be on my way sooner. There was not one other person in the Relaxation Room with me. There also isn't a wall clock and I soon found out why. \n\nMy extra ten minutes pass. No waxer approaches me. Another ten minutes go by and I'm sitting there twiddling my thumbs wondering what is going on. I decide to go up front and see what the deal is. The receptionist says she will find out and I tell her I have places to go and can't wait much longer. I go back to the relaxation room...which is now not at all relaxing. Five more minutes pass....the receptionist comes to say she's sorry and the waxer will be right with me. It was at least another five, maybe even ten, and I was boiling mad. The waxer finally strolled in and of course the waxing itself took a whopping 2 minutes.  Sure she was nice enough but she was almost half an hour late for my appointment. The receptionist didn't think it was worth comping me the $13.50 cost so the waxer received no tip. \n\nThe second time I used the Spa was when I injured my back in one of the classes and had to run, crying, out of the class. There is no Sports Medicine person on staff as far as I was aware so I hobbled to the Spa and found the receptionist in the back of the salon. I begged for a massage therapist to help me and she told me no one was there and massages didn't start until 9AM. This, by the way was at about 8:10AM. I'm standing in front of this woman, having trouble breathing and crying uncontrollably and she's telling me to wait an hour? Finally she figured out I was NOT kidding and said she'd call around to see who could come in ASAP. She helped me into a chair in the very UN-relaxing room and I wept alone there for about 15 minutes. She happened by the door again after that and said that a masseuse would be there in 15-20 minutes. I had no cell phone, watch or wall clock to measure that time, nor was any other help offered so I just continued weeping. It was 8:30AM (I'm guessing) when another spa-goer arrived for her day of treatments and went into the locker room to change. I managed to get in there as well (after a bit) and ask her if she knew the time. 8:45AM. \n\nObviously my massage therapist didn't show up until 9AM. That would be too bloody much to ask when one has a crippling back injury. Sure the massage was decent (not in price mind you). I just feel like my time and money are completely unappreciated and I absolutely will not return there. By the way, the showers in the spa area are TERRIBLE. The ones in the locker room are much better and on the whole the bathroom/locker room in the spa is a waste of space."""
"2,""I have been going to this place since I was about 11 years old!  So that is about 15 years...crazy!! Just like Nadia said... The village really is a way of life and a lifestyle...Now it is not cheap to be a member...but that is up to each individual that is willing to pay the monthly fee.  I was a member before they did their huge renovation...there used to be a Garcias restaurant next door and that closed and they took over!  Their spa is beautiful...their restaurant and bar area is a nice place to grab a bite and enjoy a glass of wine...the locker rooms are beautiful and are very nice and clean!  They have so many classes and options for everyone!

"1,""This pains me to write this review and I am giving 2 stars out of fairness and previously solid history with LGO as I live a few blocks away.  I have been there hundreds of times previously.  I have had many wonderful experiences previously and have referred dozens of friends to LGO, Chelsea's Kitchen, Postino, etc.  \n\nSo, it's this past Sunday morning and I run in real quick for a few breakfast items, those being English muffins and a regular iced mocha latte.  The place was packed as usual but seemed more so because of far too much merchandise and no where for people to wait or even stand.  The service was friendly.  In case you haven't tried the English muffins, they come in a 5 pack and they are very tasty-a must have and great toasted.  \n\nMy heart burn on this visit begins at the register.  Two two items together totaled $18.02.  I was shocked so I asked the girl at the coffee bar register if she rang it in right and she assured me she did. She was very nice about it but OMG WTF?  I paid and came home.  The mocha was way too sweet and not even comparable to Starbuck's(which I do not like for the record).  So, essentially, I paid $18.02 for a pack of English muffins.  Ridiculous!  Will I go back?  Most assuredly I will but it will be a bit before I do."""
"2,""Wanna know how to tell when your lunch salad is REALLY good?\n\nWhen you \""""drool a little bit\"""" in between bites, like I did today with my Chopped Turkey Salad from La Grande Orange.\n\nI went there on Sunday 10-24, and to be honest, the setup is a little confusing for newcomers.  Order on THIS side, pickup food on THAT side, come back to THIS side to get dessert.  It's enough to make you want to just get in the car and drive home.  But DON'T !!!\n\nIf it weren't for the \""""Drool Event\"""" which occurred today, I probably would not have posted this review at all.\n\nI shared the Green Chile Burger with my daughter, and we were both underwhelmed, really.  Nothing awesome about the burger.  Oh, it's FAR better than fast food burgers, but it's not comparable to Lobby's or Chuckbox (my two top burgers in town, probably.)  The french fries were a little thin and not too memorable really.\n\nMy son had the wings and loved them  But a hitch - I SPECIFICALLY requested RANCH for the wings, and they came out with Blue Cheese, which I then had to take back and get exchanged for Ranch.  Not a huge problem, but just a little annoying.  The Ranch was very good however.\n\nThe \""""Olive Oil Cake\"""" that everyone RAVES about?  Meh.  It's just an extra-moist version of your average pound cake.  Tastes just like the pound cake I grew up eating in Texas, but it was a little \""""oilier\"""" than your usual pound cake fare.  It was good, but not \""""Oh My God!\"""" good.\n\nNow for the best item I had from there:  The Drool Creator.\n\nIt was mostly an afterthought, really.  While standing in line to get the Olive Oil cake to go, I saw the little section where they keep their \""""to go\"""" salads.  I looked around at the varieties, and thought the Chopped Turkey Salad looked promising - bacon, boiled egg, turkey slices, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and two different dressings - Blue Cheese and some sort of yellowish vinaigrette.   I decided to take one home and eat it for lunch at work on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nGreat.  Decision.\n\nI don't really know what the magic was.  Maybe it was just a good combination of flavors.  Maybe it was just all fresh.  Maybe they use some sort of Magical Salad Crack.  I don't know.  But it was a DANG good salad.  Even on the third day, when I ate the last of it.\n\nI just combined both dressings ( about half of each little container each day ) and it was marvelous.\n\nNot too many meals cause me to drool in between bites.  This salad had some serious Mojo.\n\nI WILL be back for another one, hoping to recapture the Magic."""
"2,""LGO never fails me.  It is absolutely my favorite place to have brekkie.   \nIt is a tradition to head to LGO when I am in Phx visiting KD. Simply said, I would not leave satisfied if we didn't go. Today I was able to introduce my friend Mike S to this favorite of mine. I do believe he left this fine establishment as a fan.  Other friends joined us today and the majority of the table had a commuter sandwich.  It is the BEST breakfast sandwich on the planet.  It consists of an English muffin (made at LGO), eggs, tomato and mayo.  My meat of choice on the commuter is bacon.  This sandwich is addictive!  \nThe best thing about LGO is that you cannot go wrong with anything you order.  You will leave happier (impossible not to). I have been to LGO too many times to count but each time I leave, I 'm one happy camper!  Mike and I were waiting for our food, looking at the other items that were ready and thinking that everything looked scrumptious.  On days that the commuter has not been my choice, I have had the french pancakes (delicious) or the fruit (always so nice and fresh). \nLGO has a fun atmosphere and a cute store to wander around in while you wait.  I would be amiss if I didn't mention their iced tea.  I always have the standard iced tea but I know people also greatly enjoy their iced green tea.  I started with the iced tea and as much as I love green tea, I can't move beyond the regular iced tea.  I also appreciate being able to get a refill before I exit.  \nAlso, I always marvel at the sweet treats from Tammy Coe in the display cases by the register. On occasion, I bring some back to Tucson to share.\nLove love love LGO!!"""
"2,""The fresh MJ breads and Tammie Coe cakes/pastries are the best on the west coast.  The communter sandwich is my favorite breakfast food.  The to go salads are fresh and more than you can eat. It is a very popular place, so be prepared to wait in line, but it is worth it!"""
"2,""THe LGO grocery is quite unique.  You walk into the front and you see a menu with breakfast items, sandwiches, pizzas, and incredible desserts.  When you turn the corners, you run into a lot of cool trinkets, unique snacks, soaps and lotions, and much more.  The prices are a bit unreasonable, but that is expected of a store that is within a nice restaurant.  I think the rosemary raisin almond crackers looked the most interested that was within price range.  My eyes were glued towards the wine as well.  I will have to update this review once I buy something here."""
"2,""I've eaten majority of their menu and haven't found anything that I haven't liked.  It's a great place for any meal.  My boyfriend is more a breakfast person and I'm more of a lunch person so this place is perfect for us.  I love their avocado pizza - we did it with proscuitto once and it was fantastic.  The spicy tuna roll makes a great appetizer.  The white sangria is probably one of the best I've had in Phoenix.  For dessert, the red velvet cupcake is unbelievable - the frosting is the best part.  The parking kinda stinks but you can always park across the street at arcadia room and walk to LGO.  Can't say how much I love this place!"""
"2,""I went here on a morning with my wife and kids.  We left a large resort and were on our way out of town headed to the Grand Canyon.  Perhaps the service leaves something to be desired because it is a grocery that has a kitchen, but the food is out of this world.  My daughter was disappointed in the pancakes because they were more like crapes, but I loved them and my older kids loved it all.  It did not matter since she ate half of my wife's egg white omelet.  We all shared and I would go back every week if I could.  Certainly all the locals seem to be doing that."""

"2,""Time for an update on one of my favorite Phoenix places to eat, grab a bottle of vino or a clever gift!   This last trip I did two out of the three!  I had a delicious lunch and grabbed some gifts.  I have to say that if I owned a restaurant, it would be just like LGO.  I love this place and am always happy to be in LGO, whether perusing the wine or the groovy items in the store.  I am the MOST happy when I am eating some yummy food.  For years, I have been mildly obsessed (my friends will know I am underplaying my obsession) with the commuter sandwich.  It is so very good.  Pretty much perfection. The delicious English muffin, the eggs, bacon, tomato and mayo.  It rocks my world!  \nThis trip, I tried something new (gasp!).  I was also so happy I did and will now have some debating to do when I am having a bite to eat at LGO.  This time I had the brown rice bowl.  I was opting for something on the healthy side.  This dish was some seriously tasty ingredients combined in a bowl.  Such great flavor!  As usual, I look forward to my next trip to Phoenix and my visit to LGO!"""
"2,""A fun and tasty menu in an adorable shop tucked into a super cute little area.  A wonderful selection of breads to take home (among which are their famous giant English muffins), breakfast, sandwiches and salads, delectable desserts at reasonable prices.  Lots of patio seating, and super busy just about any time (weekends most of all), with spotty service.  \n\nFOOD: If you're breakfasting here, the commuter is incredible! Try it with salmon and avocado, but be sure to leave room for dessert!  The French pancakes are swell, and so is everything else I've tried, but the commuter is far and away the winner, whether you add any kind of meat or not.  If you're going for healthy, get the mayo on the side.  Red velvet anything is great here, as is the key lime pie.  \n\nSHOP: The odds-n-ends shop is my favorite eclectic collection around - I measure other cute shops by their yard stick (e.g. \""""this place is kinda cute in a La Grande Orange kind of way\"""" - but no other place quite measures up).  I've bought kitchen supplies, clothing, jewelry, books, dog toys...I could go on.  Everything is at least a little bit interesting!  I highly recommend the Out of Print and Yoganastix clothing brands - I've bought both from here and they've stayed soft and nice with much wear.   \n\nSERVICE: To be honest, the service is spotty to poor.  For a while, I had orders mixed up almost as often as correct - with no apologetic attitude, to boot - and I stopped going.  My last few visits have been pretty great (aside from overhearing a woman who had terrible service getting no help at all to make it better).  It's definitely a risk.  It's so popular that the counter employees don't seem concerned with customer service at all (the servers in the main restaurant are great, if you come for a sit-down dinner, but that's a different Yelp listing)."""
"2,""This place is the perfect man cave.\n\nTremendous selection in their large humidor, highly knowledgable staff, a smoking room with deep leather chairs and a big TV.\n\nBest of all, it's BYOB!

I love Churchill's and will be coming back many more times."""
"2,""When I was here last week, one of the other folks at the table asked me if there were lots of places like this in Ann Arbor, where I live.  Sadly, I had to answer no.  There's nothing quite like this in Ann Arbor, which is too bad. There are some great places here, and even a couple of nice places to sip wine, but the feel of Postino is totally different.\n\nThe warm weather enables the front of the cafe to be pretty much totally open (nice garage doors), and though that's not something that would work too well in Michigan in the winter, I have a feeling the the wine selection and food quality offered by Postino would go over famously here in Ann Arbor and elsewhere.  I'm not into big chains, but maybe they'd consider a satellite location?\n\nThe bruschetta is a dream -- perfect to share with a group. I especially enjoyed the roasted pepper with goat cheese"
"2,""Postinos is one of my favorite restaurants in Arcadia!  The actual building itself is an old converted post office, complete with a closing garage door.  Great wine selection and the staff is extremely helpful if you have any questions or need a recommendation.  \n\nAs for the food, it is phenomenal!  I've had the roast beef sandwich, turkey and brie, bruschetta, salads, you name it.  I have never once been disappointed with my meal here.\n\nI usually opt to split both a plate of bruschetta and a salad with a friend which is always more than enough.  My favorite salad is the raspberry chicken and for the bruschetta the brie/apple, salmon, pesto/salami, and fig/proscuitto are by far my faves.\n\nThis place is great for a first date, birthday, or dinner with a small group of friends :-) Looooove it!"""

"2,""When I first saw the menu, I wasn't sure if this place was going to live up to the hype.  It appears that they pretty much just have a handful of appetizers and a few different panini's and bruchetta.  \n\nWow, was I mistaken!  This place definately lives up to the hype.  The artichoke dip and hummus were like the best I've ever had.  The wait staff was very friendly, helpful and prompt with everything.

The $20 deal for wine and bruschetta is as good as everyone says. The prosciutto with figs bruschetta is so delicious, the salty flavor of the prosciutto combined with the sweetness of the figs is heavenly. I also love the smoked salmon and pesto combination. If you're a little hungrier and want something to yourself, the paninis are extremely satisfying. My favorite is the Autostrada, it's spicy and savory and a little bit different from any panini I've had anywhere else. The wine selection could be better, but the truth is if you're drinking out and it's not a special occasion, most people are going to want a decent house wine and leave it at that, and Postino's house wines are just fine."""

"1,""First off FRYS you need to treat your employees much better especially the employee I seen that was being talk down to because of his age. Let me paint you a picture of what I seen and heard. I went there and was behind an elderly gentleman carrying his little bag with his lunch he was limping and had on a Frys apron. He went to the front manager and asked him if there was a department he could work that day because he was just not feeling to good. It appeared he was just asking for that day. The front end manger replied, \""""I am not sure I don't know if you know how to do anything else. I just need you to pick up the speed where you are know before I consider anything else. I know I was nosing in his business but it was very heart breaking and degrading at the same time. Let me tell you something Mr, Front end Manager this elderly man is probably the last few of his kind that knows how to work and I am sure worked his tail off. Do NOT ever talk to that generation with anything but respect and kind  assistance where you can offer it. That is if he even allows you because that generation never looked for handout and that is why this gentleman is still working and packing his little lunch to show up for work and not call in like many would or I am just assuming with your company maybe that will be your excuse to let him go. So after listening to this and no it was not my business but I am sure half the things anyone witness in public is not anyone's business but we still slow down to see the wreck. So I proceeded to get my $325.00 of groceries at your place when I should have walked right out and drove down the road. I went isle to isle and as I neared the front another female front end was barking out orders to the checkers yelling right in my ear. Yes, I looked at her and gave her one of my signature looks (Are you serious what is wrong with you) type of look and she continued to degrade the front end employees. However it must not have had an effect on these two clowns that checked me out. Because they were laughing at other people with disabilities and bagging my groceries like they were tossing rocks in a pile. Now let me gentle remind you FRYS without your customers you are nobody and word of mouth travels so fast and as you know all the advertising on billboards cannot compare for a bad experience and a woman that will make it her job to inform the abuse this elderly man took on this day. I was never going to step foot in this store but that is wrong to complain -and not do something. So every week about 2 times I make it a point to check to see if this gentleman still works there and that he may be treated a little more kinder. SHAME ON YOU! for allowing these putz kids to act like idiots and the little feeble elderly man that apparently needs the job and comes to work to make the best out of it is treated with such degrading words and gestures. I wanted to reach in my purse and give him his wage for the day and whip on his apron and show your little store what compassion really means. But I figure this is a generation with great pride and it would do nothing more than make him feel worse. Mark my words! If I ever have your front end manager yell in my ear as I pass by or witness your employees show this man any disrespect you will hear my opinion yell right back and you know those people who holds signs and marches in front of your store well there is a truck full of worker down by Home depot that I can get together that you will see my opinion loud and clear."""

She also ordered the country potato over the hashbrown which was a good move for her. \n\nAfter I complained they brought back a hot new order of hashbrown but it took a while (about 15 minutes) and they didn't seem too apologetic so I wasn't very pleased.

First of all, I hate buffets with a fiery passion, but this is by far the worst one I've ever had the displeasure of being dragged to. The ambience of the restaurant makes you feel as if you're eating your last meal in prison before being sent off to the chair. The food was gross and the food options were miniscule. I only had a few bites because I didn't like it and I was worried I'd get sick, if you ever visit this dive trust me, you'll feel the same way. The booths are also extremely uncomfortable and the restaurant is tiny and crammed. Bottom line, they should have just let this buffet chain die."""

When I got back, I found that the car wash left the door open and that the vehicle wouldn't start...To my surprise all power was dead and it didn't have the power to turn on a flashlight!

"1,""My fiance and I were vacationing to Arizona in June 2011.  We are not from the area so we like to get local recommendations and find some great places through yelp. After our awful experience here, I just had to sign up on yelp and tell everyone my our experience (do not disregard because I am new to giving my opinion on yelp).\nWe had no reservations but that doesn't mean you have to give us such a bad attitude when we asked for a table?  Yet, I think they gave us the worst table because we had no reservations?  Literally 2 mins after we were seated, they seated 2 older men right next to us and we might as well been a table of 4!  They were so close and so loud that we were part of their conversation.  How romantic.  The places wasn't even full and there were empty tables!\nNice selection of fresh made pasta...\nBut I ended up ordering a dish from their regular menu, Red Linguine Portifino with shrimps and scallops.  The sauce just ok and wasn't even that spicy. And what scallops?  There were barely any in the dish.  And the shrimps...are you kidding me?  They were tiny and with the full tail on which was like half the shrimp because they were so small.  I've been to many fancy italians restaurants and when I order an expensive past dish, I expect not to spend most my time picking the tail off with my knife and fork.  What a pain.  Funny thing is, then loud man sitting next to us order the same dish.  Instead of using his fork and knife, he simply put the whole shrimp in his mouth and used his fingers to pull the tail out.  How classy!!  \nI almost forgot to add, it was nice one of the chef's walked around and said hello and asked how everything was but if you are going to do that, why exclude CERTAIN tables?  Very rude.\nAll in all, for the expensive price we paid for dinner, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND it!"""
"2,""Sadly, I missed dinner service here so a couple of associates and I grabbed a late-night dessert at this lovely Italian restaurant.\n\nWe were very impressed with the atmosphere of this restaurant. Although we chose to sit outside, the location proved to be very hidden and private-- perfect spot to take your date! Our server was perfect and extremely attentive. Even though he knew we were only ordering desserts, he still took the time to go through their best options. We decided to go with a couple glasses of wine, some coffee, and a Tiramisu to share. The attention on our table was never lost, in fact, as the night grew chilly, our server came back and helped move a heat lamp closer to our table to keep warm.\n\nThe Tiramisu was excellent and I'm truly sorry to say I wasn't able to experience more of their great food! Will definitely be back on the next trip!"""
"1,""The worst experience in my life. The menu is not clear and the waitress did a horrible job describing the ingredients."""
"1,""the really bad italian restaurant in Scottsdale, The chef is snubbing that he do not allow any people to change the side of the plate because he want you to force to buy extra pasta for $16.00 dollars. Please take care when you order the extra ugly and not flavors pasta it is expensive, the any dessert is over $ 15.00 and the bad Espresso is $ 5.00 dollars, I ate on the best Italian  restaurant in Dubai,London,Germany,Italy.But i never ate crap like this i  do not recommended this restaurant. I prefer Tomaso or Tutti santi by Nina ."""
"1,""Had a \""""company\"""" meal here. The foot was decent but I would not say outstanding. The chicken dela casa OK, the asparagus was cooked about perfectly but the dinner salad was pretty boring. --just lettuce and tomato, nothing else. The dressing was pretty bland too. I don't think I would return on purpose. The only really positive things I can say are 1. I did not have to pay because I was on company business and 2. It was better than Olive Garden"""
"2,""This place is a little hidden gem. The food was fantastic. A little bit of Italy in Phoenix. Everything we had tasted fresh and perfectly seasoned. I'll be back!"""
"1,""My main course of the tortellini was delicious, that being said, everything else was bad. I think it was because they did not seem to want our large party if 11, that on multiple times they let us know was an inconvenience (the restaurant was only 1/3 full), and when our napkins were mildew smellingand we politely asked for new ones, they treated us like we were rude, smelling the napkin and saying the entire bag came back from the laundry like this (hello, why would you out them on thetable then!) We also asked for new glasses because the store the napkins in the glasses. It was just horrible after that. The bread I was excited about was cold, wrong meals and drinks were brought with no apology. There was a good 30 minutes we saw noone, and we went through 4 different waiters. \nThey over charged the gratuity and when we showed them the math they denied it only after asking for the manager they wrote in a new price. I will never go back. Even after all that we were standing out front at the benches saying our goodbyes when 2 different waiters came out and walked around the group. They seemed like they were trying to get us leave but I can't be positive."""
"1,""I was staying at the Pointe Hilton and figured to give this place a try after reading all the great reviews and seeing it was close.  I had the Chicken Al Momento , with salad and a cup of cream of  mushroom soup .  The salad was a balsamic vinigerette and it was pretty lame. It only came with one small tomato slice and no onions or pepperincinis like you get at many Italian Restaurants. The soup was ok and the Chicken Al Momento was ok , but it was served on a very small bed of spaghetti , I mean a box of pasta is about a buck and a half , put some more on the plate. The menu at this Phoenix location was very limited and being from Chicago I had higher expectations."""
"2,""This place is a home run every time!\n\nAlways a nice spot for a date or intimate dinner with close friends and family, Tutti Santi is our go-to for authentic Italian.  The service is top notch.   \n\nTheir gnocchi is, in my opinion, the best in the Valley.  Try it with their pink sauce (you need to request this as the menu lists a cream sauce with a splash of marinara).  \n\nMy husband loves the Ravioli alla Nina.  It's so good. Sometimes ravioli dishes are so darn heavy, but not here!  Nina's sauces \nachieve the fine balance of lightness and flavor and this dish is a prime example.\n\nFinally, try the tiramisu.  Light, fluffy and packed with flavor, this dessert is a great way to end a wonderful meal."""
"2,""Great donuts.  I think they are just a slight step below BoSa, but they are very good."""
"2,""5 stars all of the way!  The cute girl behind the counter recommended the maple bacon donut.  It was interesting and not bad by any means but it wasn't for me.  The apple fritter on the other hand!!!!!    It was amazing.\n\nI recently moved to Phoenix and have been looking for a good donut shop like I had at home.  I haven't even been able to find a good cake donut in this town.  I have been settling for dunkin donuts, safeway or frys crappy selection.\n\nI brought donuts in for the office and they were talked about all day.  I have a feeling I will be stopping by very soon to pick up more office goodies."""
"1,""My husbands back went out, so bad to the point he couldn't  stand on his own and would cry trying to sit up. He had gone to a chiropractor yesterday and they said he needed an MRI to confirm the severity.unfortunately he could physically get to a radiologist in time.   I decide to  take my husband to the ER because he coolant even go potty with out my help, I was really worried about him. \n\nFrom the moment i walked in , I asked the ER administrator for assistance getting my husband out of the car and I get this crazy nurse who is yelling at me that she is busy and doesn't have time. I felt like she was telling me to o away. So I asked if there was another hospital close by. Immediately they get two staff members to help.\n\nAfter being checked in and a nurse practitioner starts ridiculing my husband for coming to an emergency room for back pain and requesting an MRI. Every question my husband answered came with a sneer response back from the nurse. Finally I was livid at that point and asked his boss the RN, if we are wasting their time being here. I called another hospital that knew about the situation and welcomed us. \n\nEvery person we encountered was just miserable and it showed well. Never again. I will give my business with arrowhead health from here on out."""
"1,""I usually don't complain about Panda Express for yet the food is great and somewhat cheap. However this visit was disappointing.

When we got our order the Orange chicken tasted dried out. Overall the food was old. Very disappointed."""

"2,""Great Restaurant! Large Portions and good food."""
"1,""I had a terrible craving for Mexican food the other night, and found myself in this complex doing miscellaneous shopping. So my son and I wandered over to this restaurant, having not been before, just recognizing the name. Walking in, it felt large and clean. It took a while to be seated, and when we did we were put in a corner booth. The waitress was nice, but short with her words. I ordered the chicken chimi with red sauce, and got my son the bean burrito kids meal. Food was just okay. I find myself only coming on here to write so so reviews, and maybe that's not fair as im picky! Probably due to being stuck in a corner booth, the waitress didn't check on us once, and I had to flag her down to get my bill. I suppose if you live in the neighborhood it would be okay to check out, but I wont be back. There are too many other authentic places in town to come here."""
"1,""idk...i've gotta say, i've had far better pizza than this.  i too was excited to try this place based on the reviews.  we got decent service, in fact our server was super nice and cute.  we split a salad that was simply lettuce and spinach with a tomato thrown in. the 5 bucks we spent on that could have purchased both 1 bag of lettuce and 1 bag of spinach.\n\nmy first glass of wine was corked and so much so that when i went to take a drink it burned my eyes but they were very nice about getting me a new glass of wine.\n\nnow on to the pie...  \n\nwe got the spinach special which came with a saccharin sweet sauce"
"2,""Ugh, some of the best pizza in town.  Just moved to the 'Slope in 2011 and this place has added a couple of pounds to me for sure.

The kind that made you so happy and hinted that there would be a Pacman machine in a table top?  That's what this place makes me feel like.\n\nI LOVE the Spicy Italian specialty pizza, and even though it sounds weird, you just have to try the Spaghetti and Meatballs Calzone.  Ask for it with Ricotta, you'll thank me!"""
"1,""Sassy Glasses has one thing going for it"
"2,""If I could award more than 5 stars for Sassy Glasses, I surely would.  In addition to having a funky selection of frames you won't find anywhere else, they have genuinely kind folks to help you out.  \n\nTry as many frames as you like until you find the ones you love, and they won't mind. They make every effort to get you into the right pair for YOU.  Conversely, even if you have fallen in loooove with a frame, they will tell you the hard truth if your prescription will look terrible in them.  Sad news indeed, but far better than taking delivery of a look that's not what you expected.  \n\nWe had shopped around prior to our visit and placed an order without hesitation.  Admittedly the interesting styles are more expensive, but Sassy Glasses' prices are not out of line with other optical boutiques of the same caliber.  They also have a number of selections that are priced near the upper end of what the chain stores might offer, but are oh so much more appealing.\n\nMuwah!!"""

They make my finicky customized orders with no issue and I always prefer to visit them rather than a Starbucks, but I have to hold a star back due to their pretty limited hours.  They close especially early on Sundays considering their line of business, so sometimes I end up having to hit the Starbucks anyway. :("""
"2,""First ill start off with saying my truck is currently getting repaired at Als this very moment and I will update my review as soon as I pick it up. What brought me into Als Unibody and Frame Repair shop. About 3 weeks ago i bought a 2003 Dodge Dakota in last week to have Al take a look at it. I bought the truck off Craigslist and got ripped off big time. Not only did I have to put $2,000 in repairs to the motor and tranny within not even a week of owning it, I found out after pressing my breaks hard and hearing a loud pop underneath my truck and it pulling hard to the right that my frame was pretty much cracked in half. The seller used bondo and paint to hide it. I took the truck in to 3 different auto collision center's and was turned down by 2 of them and the 3rd one estimated the damage to be at $3,500. I decided to do some more shopping and found some private welderd and was turned down by all 3. One of them recommended I take it to Al. Im glad I did. He put my truck on the lift and checked it over explaing everything in detail. After looking my truck over he said I would need a comple right side frame piece from another truck. He called several junk yards and got a few different prices and went with the that cost me less. When he showed md the estimate he wrote up  I thought there must have been a typo coming in a little over $2,000 less then what the other shop quoted me. Of course I went forward with the repairs I felt real comfortable leaving my truck in his hands. I never felt pressured into anything and I never got the feeling that he was \""""in it for tge money.\"""" Now with all that being said he definitely made a good first impression and as soon as I pick up my truck I will update this review and tell about my experience after repairs r done"""

"1,""We have been coming here for years, loved the food and the ambience...until tonight. This was suppose to be a special night out for our daughter before she headed off to college. We decided to sit in the bar area..bad idea if you want to be served food quickly. We ordered our dinner at 6:00....at 6:35 our waitress came by to apologize for how long it was taking...apparently there was a private party with 60 people in the area next to us and the food was taking a while. That was a little hard to believe as there was a family of 5 sitting in the restaurant area who got bread and were served long before us...and we didn't get any bread. Our food finally arrived at 6:45. My daughter and I ordered the salmon, my husband-the steak. The salmon was supposed to have a citrus marinade..no citrus flavor was to be found, and it was very dry. My husband's steak was so over done and dry, he didn't even want to bring the leftover home to our dog. We expressed our disappointment to the waitress-who was very nice and apologized..she mentioned the chef is new and we are not the first people to complain about the food.

"1,""I must say... I was really looking forward to having dinner here. We were on a quick weekend get away in Scottsdale for my 32nd birthday, and I booked this place to celebrate with the love of my life. \n\nBoy oh boy, what a disappointment !!! We arrived, and I was impressed with the atmosphere, decor, and the fantastic view stretching across the phoenix urban sprawl. When we checked in with reception, we were informed that we would have a 10mn wait to be seated outside.\n\n\""""10mn ? Not a problem !\"""", I said, and continued on to state that we would grab a drink at the bar and sit outside to take a look at the view, while we waited to be seated in the dining area.\n\nAnd we waited. And waited. And waited. All the time, seeing free seats being taken by others (although there was no one waiting behind us). We ended up asking about it, and they were quite rude, did not apologize, and ended up telling us that they had been looking for us, but we were no where to be found, which is IMHO a load of bullocks, given that we had made eye contact with the floor manager several times during our wait. In the end, we got seated by the bus table, still outside, my mood souring by the minute... but hey, it was my birthday, I wasn't going to let something like that ruin the moment.\n\nI wasn't surprised by the prices, as I knew what we were getting into. I was however, surprised by the crappy quality of the dinner we had for the $ we paid. \n\nThey brought the perfunctory \""""amuse gueule\"""", which was a joke, to be honest. If I was a restaurant manager, I would be literally embarrassed by what they deigned to serve: 2 table spoons of some sort of artichoke bisque served in a large mug... makes you feel like someone scraped the bottom of a soup pan and was serving you yesterday's leftovers from the local penitentiary. I was quite unimpressed. Gordon Ramsey would have had a fit.\n\nAt this point, we were also annoyed with the high powered, halogenic lights, that are pointed right in your face, literally blinding you when the beams catch you at the right angle... I was starting to have a head ache, as was my wife.\n\nThey then came around to serve us some bread and pesto butter, which I must say was pretty nice tasting.... (but come on,... how hard is it to screw up bread??).\n\nWe perused the wine menu, and decided to order a South African white chardonnay, from the Stellen Bosch region (Mirlest white)... which was pretty good. Nice touch was that we didn't finish the bottle, and they re-corked and bagged it for us before leaving... which was a plus...\n\nAs a starter, I had the pan seared foie gras... which was a bit too gelatinous for my liking (have had way better)... the waffles were a nice touch. It reminds me of a restaurant in Paris that used to serve foie gras with ginger bread... quite nice... the sweet and salty combo always works wonders.\n\nMy wife ordered the Chevre walnut tarte... one piece of advice... stay the hell away from it. Its mainly a medley of thick, sandy crust and walnut powder,  with ABSOLUTELY NO DETECTABLE trace amounts of goat cheese.... For 11$, it was an absolute rip off. The server initially didn't react when we told him that this dish was absolutely not a success... however, he did later take it off the bill.\n\nMy wife just had a really unlucky evening. Being vegetarian, she ordered the Vegetarian Trilogy.  What this ended up being was a soggy vegetable lasagna, served with a supposed macademia truffle sauce that tasted more like peanut butter, except that it was even more bland and greasy.... The truffle scented gnoccis that we ordered as a side dish, looked like, and tasted like stale, soggy, greasy fries... yuck.\n\nI however ordered the diver's scallops and lobster, which was pretty good. Not the softest lobster, but damn tasty, and the scallops were perfect, and huuuge. \n\nNo dessert, as we were pretty disgusted with the whole experience.\n\nNet/net: expensive place, crap value for money, food is totally hit and miss, but the view is nice, if they can deign paying attention to the service they provide...."""
"1,""The view for this place is nice and their food tasted not too bad but the price just doesn't justify what you get. They have some of the smallest portions I have ever seen for a pretty penny.

"2,""My husband and I committed to trying a rare, expensive restaurant on each anniversary. This year, we were led to A Different Pointe of View. Everything was special and delicious, just as one would hope for a celebratory occasion. A welcome surprise was the service provided by Luis. He gave the right amount of suggestions for courses, wine and timing - all with a sense of humor one would not expect from such a fine restaurant. (At one point, he compared himself to Cesar Milan.) We shared the Short Ribs Ravioli and Steamed Cedar Creek Clams as 2 courses, at Luis's suggestion. It felt so European! My husband savored the Coffee Brown Sugar Seared Pork Tenderloin, while I especially enjoyed Luis's suggestion of Grilled Cedar River Marinated Hanger Steak. The both proteins were some of the most tender I've ever tasted. The hanger steak was a thin serving and the perfect portion. To end, we chose a Midnight Espresso Cup, but Luis also brought us the creme brulee, too. As he said, \""""You can't come to the Pointe and miss out on the creme brulee.\"""" He was SO right. I hate dessert and it made me never want to say no to a dessert again. One thing to remember is to prepare for a long service. Food like this is worth it.

For a restaurant that charges the high end prices I expect high end service & high quality food. My girlfriend and I both ordered the filet and they were both slightly over cooked but not enough to send them back. It was my girlfriends birthday so they were nice enough to bring out a free dessert but they should have asked me if it was something we liked first because it was not.

And if you're not sure, give them a call and the receptionists can give you a recommendation! \n\nI love the decor of the place, it's appealing to the eye (if you know what to look for) and it's classy. I would say it's the best mixture of an upscale salon and a place I could go just to hang out. \n\nEveryone that works there is nice and their personalities run the spectrum!! Some are sweet and soft spoken while others are boisterous and outgoing. The one thing I would never say is that this salon is anything like a factory. It's functionality and flowing set up allows clients to be the center of their stylists, esthetician, or nail techs attention. Each person there brings their own personality and pop! to their area but is by no means cluttered. \n\nI would recommend this salon to anyone visiting the Phoenix area!!

While the iced tea served there is good, I diddnt think they would bring it to me in a tiny styrofoam cup. I used to go to Rolfs. But wanted a change. I explained this to the receptionist that I am in bad need of a new look. I tried to book my appointment with Bobby, but he was on vacation. So I asked who was good with coloring brunette hair and she told me Rachel. I arrived early because after reading reviews I thought parking would be a nightmare. I had no problem parking and there were many spots available.\nRachel was a doll. She had an awesome personality. And after I told her I really wanted a change, there wasnt much hair cut off at all. The color was beautiful when I left the salon, but the red washed out within 3 days. I was very dissapointed. Also I saw other stylists giving the neck massages forever! However, I diddnt get any such treatment. The only time I got in the sink was to quickly wash the color out.\nI do not love the cut. When I spend that much money on a salon visit. I think I should LOVE it. I will not be returning to the salon. But for those of you who wish to, there is a 20 percent off coupon on arizonaspagirls.com"""
"2,""Since my first appointment with Brandi three years ago, I won't let anyone else near my hair.  Best highlights ever, and great cuts from short to long and back again.  I have recurring goth phases too, so I appreciate that she doesn't condemn me for being a child of the 80s.  "

Staff wearing tuxedo like clothing that on paper looked good but in reality was wrinkled and a thin facade.\n\nThe food here too lacked any unique presentation or flavor. The bar did seem to have decent prices, and to add to the class the urinals in the restroom have cup holders so you can bring that drink with you."""

Rude receptionist didn't want to make things right and said a tech may come in 3 days. Techs were nice. Who knows whats up with my garage door opener. But geez...horrible customer service.

"2,""This may be the best hole-in-the-wall Mexican food I've ever had.\n\nI found this place on Yelp after searching for Mexican restaurants in the Sunnyslope area, and was expecting a lot after all the rave reviews. My boyfriend and I have been there for dinner twice now, and attempted a third time but arrived too late because I forgot that they close at 8pm :( One of the only negative things about the place so far. I think they should stay open until at least 9PM, but oh well.\n\nI've read numerous comments about poor service but both times I've been, service has been just fine. Maybe a little on the slow side regarding the check, but I can let that slide as I was not in a hurry to leave either time. The ambiance is not romantic or necessarily inviting, but it's charming in its own way.\n\nI found it a little strange that they charge for chips and salsa ($1), but it's a small price to pay, as the chips were very fresh and the salsa (both the salsa served with the chips, and the bottled hot sauce) was quite good. I think both times I've eaten at El Bravo, I ordered the chicken chimichanga dinner special served with sour cream, guacamole, cheese, tomato and rice and beans on the side. The chimichanga was AMAZING. Flavorful, juicy, tender shredded chicken and a very fresh and crispy flour tortilla. The toppings were a little overwhelming, next time I may ask for them on the side. The rice and beans both had good flavor and I was very satisfied with the whole meal. I thought the little crispy flour tortilla with cinnamon sugar which was brought with the check was a very nice way to end the meal.\n\nEl Bravo is a little nondescript and can be easy to miss while looking for it, but it's totally worth it!"""

"2,""So, I am new to the Sunnyslope area and work nearby. Choices when you have a half hour lunch are pretty slim around here. We have Jack in the box, McD's and a Subway. I had never seen this little place because it's so well hidden. A friend who lives in the area recommended I try their sandwiches. Since I'd like to think I'm open to trying new things I walked on in. The deli is quite the interesting little place. Italian posters have taken over the store and it's kept dark. They seemed to have a vast array of authentic Italian foods for cooking at home. The menu offered variety of sandwiches as well as pizza (sold by the slice) and spaghetti. I settled on a salami sub. Wow, I have never realized a sub can taste SO good!! The salami with the cheese they used plus the condiments gave the sub a nice little kick. Everything tasted quite fresh. The tomatoes were smaller and shiny, bright red. The prices are great. What I could tell a sub runs 2.50- 4.00. Well worth it for its size. They also have the option of getting a side with your sub. While waiting for my sub to be prepared I did grab an orange Italian ice from the freezer. Once at work, I found it had no taste. It was just orange colored ice. All in all, great experience! Can't wait to try some more sandwiches!"""

"1,""I thought Gallagher's was a sports bar?  I had planned to meet a couple of friends and watch a rare ASU baseball broadcast on national TV.  I arrive first, and have to practically beg to have the game put on one of the many TVs present.  (I'm sure none of the other 3 people in the bar were watching Jeapardy).  Another patron (one of 3 already there) had asked previously, he told me later, only to be shot down by the manager.  So then I asked if I could actually listen to the game, too?  No such luck.  Did I mention this was the home-town ASU baseball team, nationally ranked, fighting for their post-season?  And a sports bar opts to play 80's hits, instead?  I quickly called BS on that, and as soon as the rest of my party arrived, we left.  If you want a \""""sports bar\"""" near Squaw Peak, I suggest trying 16th St. Sports Bar n Grill, instead.\n\nI've been to many Suns games and other events at Gallagher's, so I assumed they would have a local sports team on tv with audio.    The food is OK, the prices are a bit steep for pub-grub.  When I was there, a Monday during happy hour, there were about equal number of wait staff to patrons, and it still took 10 minutes to get a drink.\n\nI'm very disappointed in the service, and the lack of understanding by the management.   The food isn't enough to get me back, and the prices are higher then average.  I'd give it less then one star, if I could."""

The sauce was a little plain and I ordered extra cheese on my pizza and got just enough cheese to cover the sauce.  I am willing to try Stumpy's again because the service is so friendly and the pizza is prepared right in front of you.

Yoga teacher training/advanced studies program\n\nI've been doing yoga for more than 15 years, and have tried many studios in the valley. Yoga Pura, by far, is the best studio in town for an authentic experience of yoga.\n\nI particularly enjoy Eric's classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There is a certain focus and concentration, as well as a the overall feeling of peace I experience during his classes that I just can't get anywhere else. He teaches yoga as a discipline for creating peace and happiness in his students' lives...not just fluffy stretching.\n\nSome of my other favorite classes include Nyla's Level 1 & 2 and essentials,  Rachel's essentials class, and for a good restoration class, check out Laura. I also absolutely LOVE the Yoga Nidra (guided meditation) offered here. Nidra is really hard to find in town, and YP is one of the few places that actually trains teachers in the practice of Nidra. \n\nRegardless of what your looking for...hatha, flow, power, gentle, restorative, meditation...whether you are new or an experienced practitioner, you will find something here that suits your practice style. My best advice to you is to try different teachers and different classes. \n\nOnce you start coming here, you may never stop! If you come regularly, you will undoubtedly make friends. It's so nice to come to class and see people I've met over the years. The community at YP is definitely one of the things that makes it so special.\n\nLastly, yet most importantly.... \n\nYoga is about realizing your limitless potential and releasing from the suffering of the mind. It does this by bringing you into alignment with your \""""true self\"""" and freeing your mind from the lies it tells itself. I always knew that yoga made me feel better. But it wasn't until I started practicing with Eric at Yoga Pura that i started to understand why. This lead me to take YP's Yoga Teacher Training and Advanced Studies program in 2011. It was by far THE BEST thing I have done to improve my life. And for that, I will be eternally grateful to Eric, YP teachers and the YP community.\n\nBut don't take my word for it...Test it out for yourself. They offer 3 free classes for newcomers. ENJOY!"""

She wanted to talk about everything but shipping the package.  It was almost like she couldn't hear because she paid no attention to the questions we were asking.  We finally get a price and it is outrageous and she quotes a time different than what we filled out on the slip.  I came home and found a FedEx location very close to where we were trying to ship the package in about 60 seconds on the FedEx site.  We were quoted $160+ for overnight.  Per the FedEx site we got a quote for $110 using generous measurements.  We also got a quote for $77 for Saturday delivery which the store person couldn't even come close to figuring out.  Ultimately we took the package to UPS and shipped for Saturday delivery at $75, less than half of the only option the clerk could come up with.  I have shipped thousands of items with FedEx, UPS, USPS etc. and you do have to ask questions or you can be disappointed.  This gal clearly has not been trained and I don't have enough time to do their job for them.  We were there 30 minutes and finally left because we couldn't get anywhere.

"1,""We have been going to Salute for over 10 years.  Has been our favorite place to go.  Went there for New Years Eve last night, never again.  Still great food, service questionable depending on the server but the owner/boss whatever she is has to be the most ignorant, uncaring, un-service oriented person I have ever met.  We merely questioned the menu re the lack of potato with a steak, the lack of Caesar salad at an Italian restaurant and she more or less told us too bad, the chef is working hard.  She told us that is the way it is, no apology.  We wanted to use a gift certificate from Restaurant.Com, wouldn't accept it.  Finally agreed to take a plain gift certificate.  We told her that we were not happy and would not be back.  She blatantly said, \""""I don't care\"""" .  They will be out of business within 2 years.  Too bad, great place.  We talked to both staff members and other patrons on the way out and they totally agreed."""
"2,""A few weeks ago I came here to have an alignment, because someone hit a curb in my car and my tire was wobbling pretty bad.  they did the alignment but that didn't fix the problem.  Well as it turned out I needed a new wheel because the old one was bent.  I drive a mini cooper, and they didn't have the wheel for it so they told me to go ahead and buy it (I bought it online) and they would install it for me.  What I didn't realize until I took it there for the installation was that they were going to do it free of charge.  I think these guys are great.  I will continue to go to them in the future!"""
"1,""This is the worst experience I have ever had in the Auto service industry. I made an appointment for an oil change with a Groupon coupon I had purchased. My appointment was at 9am and I arrived on time. I asked how long it might be and was told an hour. I sat down in the waiting room with three other individuals who had arrived prior to me. The one gentleman was in for a tune up, one gal to have her breaks checked and another woman to get her brake pads replaced. Two hours and fifteen minutes later the four of us are still sitting there with no news or updates on our vehicles. The breaks checked gal decides she will need to come again another day and when she tells the clerk this he says, \""""Are you sure? We are about to pull your car in now.\"""" The break pads woman left after 3.5 hours. At 11:15 am the clerk comes to tell me that they did not have the correct oil filter for my car so they have ordered one but he doesn't feel comfortable letting me leave with the current one installed and asks if I can wait another 15 minutes. I reply by stating that I don't feel that I have a choice. At 12:54 he comes to tell me my car is ready. (What happened to 15 minutes?) He offers me six free oil change coupons for the inconvenience and states that \""""it doesn't normally take this long.\"""" Yet everyone else in the waiting room had been waiting nearly as long for their minor services as well. Four hours for an oil change? No offer to take me home, no communication as to what was taking so long, no honest apologies - just an offer to come back for free oil changes. Free or not, my time is worth more than that. I was not pleased when I left to get into my car to find my keys were dirty with a black residue and so was my steering wheel, emergency break and shifter. Yuck! I had to clean me and the inside of my car after my visit. I was sorely disappointed."""

Wednesday nights they have 1/2 of a bottle of wine and their house red is pretty good. Very family friendly (sometimes too many families...) but the patio is always a good, chill option.

"2,""My dog is 86 pounds of pure chicken. She's a rescue who is still very nervous around strangers (and vacuums, doorbells, and wood flooring), and her size can make her a real monster when she's scared. Yet she still needs annual checkups and booster shots, and Lookout Mountain is the lucky winner. The front desk was very cooperative at shuffling her right into the exam room when we arrived so that she wouldn't have to sit in the waiting room (with all those scary strangers). The vet tech and the vet were both very patient and so very sweet to her throughout the visit. My dog responded very well to their kindness, and actually behaved better for them than she has with any other stranger (even though the mailman has never tried to put a thermometer in her butt!). I'm very happy with how they handled my dog. (Though, from experience, it helps to schedule the first appointment of the morning and call them en route to warn them that a big scared dog is on its way.) They also see my cat, which has also always been a positive experience. (But he's always well behaved at the vet. He's just glad he gets let out of the evil plastic box inside the evil metal box on wheels. He doesn't care what the vet does to him, as long as he's out of the box.)"""
"1,""This place kinda sucked. We went araound lunch time so it was almost at full capacity I fig it would be ok since it was full and all. It looked like there was 2 people working here. I give props to the mex girl cooking all the food. It's cafeteria errrr um Subway style mexican food they ask you what you want and add it to your burro or w/e you get a tray and sit. I had a veggie burrito which was basically rice and your choice of black or pinto beans they did have 3 tortilla's to choose from. It was a pretty big burrito and fairly good but nothing special. The kid had a chicken quesadilla which was tiny they put like maybe a tablespoon of chicken in it with a side of cinnamon chips they gave her like 4 chips and a small ftn drink not very much for the 4.25 kids meal if you ask me. Their Salsa bar was disgusting with wilted cilantro, salsa's, limes and lemon's. The only plus here is the drinks! They serve good beer here Modelo, dos XX, Cuervo rita's, and even 99 cent margaritas everyday which I did not try. They also had fountain jugos. I may go back next time but more for the drinks."""
"1,""HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Beware when ordering they will not even attempt to correct there mistake! I ordered the shrimp and vegetable dinner combination.

The girl on the line said it was no problem that they wouldn't charge me. About 3 min later a women with a heavy accent called and explained that I did not say I wanted a combination and they are too busy to come back. I was so appalled! I barely knew what to say!

My son really likes their eggrolls (I'm just not a fan of eggrolls at all).  The only problem I ever had was on a take out order - they forgot to include my crab puffs!  When I called to complain, they apologized and said they would send them over with their delivery person.  They arrived in about 5 minutes!  So I would definitely recommend Dragon Bowl..."""

"1,""what is it with my luck paying money for services that fail to fix my problem? I went in to Big O Tires after seeing an advertisement on their window for an A/C check. After driving around 2 wks in a hot as hell car I said enough is enough and gave them a call to diagnose the problem. I was told that I was almost a pound low on freon and sent on my way. Yay! Cheapest option, right? Wrong. So very very wrong. Unfortunately I dropped by an hour before closing so I'm guessing I was rushed out while they were closing shop. They either never checked the air coming out of my vents for themselves or they KNEW they were ripping me off $150.

I brought it in Monday and paid for an evac and recharge.\"""" He had no idea. Smell something fishy yet?

I was referred to a shop for them to check as they couldn't do it there but they couldn't refund me for the evac and recharge. However I could have this shop do the repairs and Big O wouldn't charge for the second evac and recharge that would have to be done on my car. First off... nobody would let someone leave their shop after doing work only to have someone else finish the job. WTF.\n\nSo here I am now spending a grand for a new A/C today when $29.95 was supposed to diagnose this a week ago.\n\nIf you are feeling charitable, at least pick a more honest organization to throw your hard earned money at.

"1,""I don't expect much from any fast food restaurant.  Truth be told, no honest person does.  It's fast food.  If we wanted a lot, we would just make it ourselves.  What I do expect, and what most people expect is reliability.  That's it... reliability.\n\nThat is something that this particular location of Taco Bell sorely lacks.  I have been there at 10:30, and they're open.  I have been there at 11:55, and they're open.  I even asked the hours once.  I was told that Sunday-Thursday, this location is open until 12:00AM, and on the weekends, they are open until 1:00AM.  Yet... they are unreliable...I wonder if the owner knows their staff closes early?\n\nOut of the last six times I have been to this location - on a weeknight - between 11:00 and 11:30 - they have been closed.  Sometimes they are open... sometimes they are closed.  You never know with this place.  If the owner were to check the power bill by the hour and see when the bill dropped off, they would be aware because the signs are off, the exterior lights are off, and the interior lights are off.  Don't advertise you are open if you're not going to be open.\n\nI went by tonight at 11:10PM and everything was off.  I work in a restaurant and don't want to go home and cook for myself on the nights that I work because I spend 8 hours cooking for other people while I'm at work.  I really wanted Taco Bell tonight, but because of the unreliability of this location, I spent my money elsewhere.  \n\nI really just hope the owner of this location gets a handle on the hours of their store.  Inconsistency is not okay.  If the employees want to close at 11:00 like they apparently did tonight (like I said, the sign-lights were off, the drive thru lights were off, the interior lights were off... on the whole, the place screamed, \""""Don't spend your money here!\""""), then that is fine... just be open about it.  Don't promise the public hours and don't deliver.\n\nI know this is a long review for Taco Bell, but I kept pulling for this place to get it together.  After four months of never knowing what the hours were going to be at this location, I finally convinced myself to write a review.  In a simple phrase... \""""This location lacks on the most important function of customer service: Consistency.  There is none.\"""""""

My order came the food was good but she never brought my side of hot peppers, I also did not get a refill on my tea.  When it was time to get the bill, she told my friend if he took the other part of his sandwich home with him the manager said he would have to be charged for it.

This is not the first time in the last couple of visits that the service was off, or the wrong orders came.  I will take a long break before I go back into Uncle Sam's again, the same with my friend, we probably average going in there about 5 times a month, not anymore, I guess we should have requested one of the waitresses that we know are good servers there like Tiffany, we probably wouldn't have had a problem, but the wise manager I guess does not want our business anymore so we won't spend our money there for a long while.  Maybe they will get their act straight or either we'll see Jon Taffer in there soon.\n\nP.S. On one other occasion I walked out because after waiting and not getting my drink after 12 minutes I decided to go somewhere else, So it is my fault for giving them another chance too soon."""
"1,""Not impressed with the service or the pizza.  \n\nI was craving some wings and pizza and we were in the neighborhood. We have been here before because we loveee the wings and I thought we loved the pizza.  So we order a small pizza, wings and an appetizer, which was fried zucchini.  We let our waitress know, Aubrey was her name, that we wanted the appetizer first.\n15 minutes roll around and no appetizer! Plus my husband was out of water and she hadn't come around. Finally a different waitress comes out with our order, minus the appetizer.  I mention to her we haven't received it and our waitress shows up just in time to hear this and basically scolds the other waitress helping out, like it was her fault that we didn't get our appetizer.  So we ask for a refill as she leaves, no problem, or at least we thought, 5 minutes into eating their suicide wings (which are by far the hottest hot wings I have ever tasted) my husband is really in need of that water. Finally I see her come around but with no water, she almost makes it to the table when I see that she realizes the same thing and she does a complete 180, and a few minutes later...daa daa!!! Water!!!  Other than the service completely lacking, and the pizza pretty blah, I enjoyed the wings and zucchini.  Unfortunately it did kinda ruin that satisfaction I was going for since after all I was really craving something more than what I got."""

"1,""Not really impressed with David's Bridal overall, we mainly only come here because the bridesmaids dresses are so cheap. I guess my expectation of someone owning a bridal shop or hiring people that work there, would actually be happy for the brides-to-be, but most of them seem like they loathe their jobs. Maybe they deal with too many bridezillas, but whatever the reason, when someone comes in and you work in retail and they are polite to you, you should just be polite back. The level of service is not that great. They seem very rushed to get you in and out as quickly as possible while doing the least they can to help you before moving onto the next customer. We called to try to schedule an appointment for bridesmaids dress shopping, but I didn't receive a call back so we just stopped in and ended up buying one of them. Then I got a call about a week ago (after already ordering my dress) to schedule the appointment. And they couldn't understand that I wasn't the bride, but merely shopping for my bridesmaid's dress for my sister's wedding. We were told it would take about 2-3 weeks to get the dress in, and I never got a call about it arriving. I had to call them, plus they even have a note on the receipt that if you don't pick it up within a certain amount of time, they will send it back. Good thing I called, because my dress had been in already and we never received a call. The girl that helped me when I came in was polite, but looked annoyed that she had to get up off her chair to run to the back to get my dress. Good thing it's cheap there, otherwise I'm not really sure how any David's Bridal stays in business"""

The employees are not interested in helping customers. They seem to only be focused on stocking the shelves and going home to their lives. \n\nWhile the prices are fantastic, it is always difficult to find what you are looking for, because they keep changing where everything is located. \n\nAlso when it finally comes time to check out, you should be prepared to wait for at least 10-15 minutes, even if you only have one item.\n\nOverall, it could be a lot better.

"1,""I have to agree with the 2 guys that gave this place 1 star. The people are pretty cool that I've met while staying here but that is the only good thing I can say about this place. We stayed here because it is close to our house that is being remodeled. The management is horrible they will never take ANY responsibility if something happens! We moved in and we had to sleep on a beat up mattress and a box spring that had wheels screwed into it. After 2 nights we started getting bit, it turns out the box spring had bed bugs in it. When we complained the awesome management and they accused us of bringing them in.  These cheap people would not get rid of the box spring so we threw it out. Went and bought a bed and used that for the rest of our stay. We bought the wifi that the complex offers but the signal is so bad we ended up getting a refund.

You can find anything and everything you could possibly need or didn't even know you needed for a party or event including: invitations, balloons, napkins, table cloths, straws, table ware, party favors (they have a candle aisle ), tiki torches, etc. Of course, Halloween time is ridiculously fun here, but they have these costumes year round which is great for those awesome theme parties you may encounter November - September.

One can also find anything and everything you need to give your self a professional manicure or pedicure. Color brands that they carry include China Glaze and Fingerpaints.

There is also tons of artificial nail systems including acrylics, gels, and wraps. \n\nThis location always seems to have what I'm looking for in-stock, which is nice because the two Sally's store closest to me are really far apart.

The Website said that the item was in-stock at this local Best Buy.  I like using the pick-up in store option whenever possible because I like knowing ahead of time that they have the item and that it's waiting for me.\n\nI made my order first thing in the morning and never received a confirmation email.  Typically, you receive a confirmation email no more than 1 hour after you have placed and paid for your order online.  I decided to go to the store to find out that they had my item in the back but that I couldn't have it yet.  When I explained that I had plans this evening and that I wouldn't be able to pick-up my item later, they simply stated that there was nothing they could do.  I asked them why they couldn't just go in the back of house to grab my item that I had already paid for but they said they just couldn't do that.\n\nThis is frustrating for 2 reasons:  1.)  It shouldn't take that long to purchase something online to pick-up in store and 2.) I don't understand why someone can't simply go in the back to grab the item that I've already purchased.\n\nI think I would have been a little more forgiving if the customer service had been better and felt that the person I was speaking with had an ounce of empathy.

"2,""This location never really disappoints. The waitstaff is friendly, a manager always asks how things are. I stick with Outback because the food is consistently delicious. \n\nToday I ordered an 8 oz filet, classic cooked, medium. When my steak came out it was...just not what I pictured it normally looking like. It didn't have the dark crusty seared outside. It was thin. It was cooked about medium well/close to well, and probably due to this it was tough. The texture was the worst part because I get the filet for the texture. Despite the fact that it's not usually the MOST flavorful cut, it's worth the sliiiiiight loss in flavor for the tenderness. The classic seasoning & sort of crunchy seared outside completely makes up for the lack of flavor compared with other cuts. \n\nI am NOT the type of person who sends things back, however, my boyfriend confirmed my concerns by telling me that he didn't think it looked like a filet. So, when Andrew the manager came by and asked how things were, I quizzed him about what cut he thought it was. He got it right...8 oz filet. I told him I only asked because it wasn't what I was used to a filet looking/feeling/tasting like. He agreed that it wasn't ideal and insisted on getting me a new one. I told him it wasn't necessary, and if it was the filet I'd eat it despite the lack of the usual Outback perfection. Nope...Andrew wouldn't have that. He brought a new one. The new one was undercooked, but since Andrew waited to see the inside before leaving it with me, he promptly took it back to be fixed.  \n\nThis time it was PERFECT. It was thick like a filet should be, and was cooked exactly medium...red in the center but not bloody. The searing was precisely what I always look forward to at Outback. It was the best steak I've had in a long time.\n\nI was very happy with the way Andrew and our server Shelby made me feel like a valued guest and made me feel like it was OKAY to let them make my order perfect. I don't think I'll become one of those picky sender backer types, but it was nice to know that at this Outback location I don't ever have to settle for anything less than perfect. \n\nBetween Andrew and Shelby, this location has secured me as a customer and I will be back next time I want a fantastic steak!"""

I'm not sure how long that was there. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\n They have terrible, terrible service.

Not so fun.  I brought the phone here and the guy was super helpful to find the right battery that would work.  While I was there I saw folks getting batteries for SO many amazing and unique things. \n\nSo if you're looking for something a little more complex than a Duracell AA, you should give them a call.  And even if that's all you think you want - if you're in the area you might want to go by because based on what kind of product you're using it for, I heard them suggest different brands/types of AA battery.

"1,""I really don't know what people see in this place. One thing, it does have that old crusty bar feel. We went as a group for drinks and food. The initial drink service was pretty quick and the experience diminished from there. I ordered one of the starred items off the menu, the Reuben. Three words best describe the sandwich ... greasy and tough! Another person at the table ordered chicken fingers, they were so dry she only ate half of one. The last person at our table had a cheese quesadilla, it was cold and looked like it had been microwaved.  The astonishing thing, the waitress actually pocketed my change from my food order.  They do like their regulars though and seem to treat them well. I can't say I would recommend going unless you are dying to find a karaoke bar.  I know I won't be going back any time soon. Actually, the sandwich I ate didn't sit very well with me either."""

I could pass on that part.\nthey also do trivia night and play every major league game usually. \ndefinitely a spot to check out if you're in the area. Good for after dinner drinks, or as a meeting spot after work.\nThe people that come here are all very social and everyone seems down to earth. \nTheir sliders are good but a little on the greasy side (buns covered in oil), but their tacos are to die for.\nThey have two pool tables and video game machines, so you don't have to just sit around and drink, except that's what I like to do.

Lasted a long time, about 2 1/2 weeks maybe. The pedicure was one of the best I've ever had! The had many options for the pedicure. You could pick what you wanted at decent prices. I get pedicures for the massaging. Longest massage I have ever gotten without paying extra. With both the sea salt and lotion. It was amazing and just the right amount of pressure. Did a nice job painting my toes as well. They were a little mad I didn't have cash for a tip though, I never carry cash. I will defiantly be coming back here!"""

"1,""We have eaten here many times over the years both at the original 40th St and Bell location and this newer location at 40th and Thunderbird location.  Nearly every time the food has been well prepared and delicious, plus the service was always attentive.  My only issue with it was I considered to be a rather pricy restaurant.\n\nThe last two times we have been there have been rather disappointing.  I don't know if there is a new chef / owner or what, but the food is not as good as before and our dishes very greasy.  The prices are still as high as before.  The service we had the other night was abominable.   The server, Jenn, was one of the worst servers we have experienced in a long time.  There were two occupied tables when we arrived (and two other servers) and we had to wait for over ten minutes to be acknowledged and for our drink order to be taken.  The specials she told us were not the same as another server was telling his table.  The meal went downhill after that.  We had to ask and re-ask for just about everything.  The one bright spot was the bus girl who was so attentive.  Jenn kept telling us how busy she was (at her busiest she had three tables) yet she had plenty of time to talk at length to a table about what was happening on the TV show \""""Big Brother\"""".  It even took forever to get the check, which was finally handled by another server.\n\nAll in all, it was a disappointing, expensive meal that was ruined even further by a terrible server."""

Thank you Shogun."""
"1,""How is this place in business?  Seriously!\n\nI'm still angry over how bad this place was.  My brother who was with me agrees.  So here is what happened...\n\nWe sit down, look over the menu and instantly notice that the place is super expensive, even for lunch.  Then my brother points out that everyone sitting down seems to be over the age of 50 and eating huge piles of colored salads.  I'm guessing this is the turkey salad.  \n\nMy theory is that for the price everyone went for quantity.  We skipped the original plan for sushi and rolls because at $12 - $15 at lunch this place did not have the atmosphere or the token chefs to warrant those prices.  We decided to start easy and try the Panko Udon noodle soup with tempura.  \n\nMy false expectation:  Thick udon noodles, in a nice translucent dark broth, with tiny green onion bits floating on top, paired with a plate of assorted vegetables covered in a light fluffy batter.  Add battered shrimp or fish depending on the place.  All this would then combine in my mouth into that great saliva generating Udon freshness that I have come to love.  \n\nIt arrived...\n\n-INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE-\n\nThe not even joking reality:  Placed in front of me was a white bowl of soy sauce with a pile of store bought rough spaghetti noodles.  Floating in this disappointment was a horror show of deep fried unrecognizable straight from the freezer bag vegetable shapes.  I say shapes because vegetables  usually have flavor which is the whole reason for including them in a dish, these could have been cardboard cutouts soaked in grease.  I wish I was joking about the soy sauce or the noodles.  It tasted like something a Home Ec student from Beverly Hills would have made first day of class.\n\n-INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE AGAIN-\n\nWell we didn't find the hidden camera and only got a few bites into the mess before giving up.  Here is the best part, the bus boy was not at all surprised when he picked up the plates mostly unfinished.  Weird wait staff aside, Shogun is absolutely hands down the worst Sushi place I have ever eaten at.  If you can't do Udon Soup don't put it on the menu.  They should be ashamed for taking that much money from innocent people who don't know what good sushi tastes like.\n\nAvoid the disappointment and save yourself some money.  You're better off at East Wind 1 mile north at Thunderbird and Tatum.  Better yet head to over to Hiro Sushi at Shea and the 101, its absolutely worth the drive.\n\n-INSERT FINAL EXPLETIVE HERE-"""
"2,""Not sure where all of the other reviewers on this site go for sushi, but I found Shogun to be right in the middle of the road for pricing.  Cheaper than Sapporo, Ra & Ah-So but a little more expensive than your traditional mom & pop sushi.  I say if you want to be seen in your micro mini with your gel head boyfriend than head to one of the aforementioned places.  If you want good sushi in a comfortable & fun setting than I would suggest Shogun.  I have been going here for nearly 20 years, well before they bought out the other side and built the bar area.  The sushi bar is always the way to go as you can be in and out in 20 minutes.  They have a fun little patio for groups (when it's not 115 outside).  I'd much rather support this establishment that has been locally owned forever than head out to another cookie cutter sushi chain."""
"1,""Dismal, abject, revolting.  These are words one would use to describe the contents of a garbage can, or a snuff film. You know nice, pleasant things that one would enjoy on a Sunday afternoon. Shogun however deserves none of this high praise. These words are a lofty goal by their standards. \n\nI was so unfortunate to collide unwillingly with this place one Saturday for lunch and decided to order the unagi roll and the Panko Udon. I was expecting some common sense from the chef/wank they picked up off the street, but even hope fails occasionally in an explosion of misery. The unagi roll was horrible. The rice was not fully cooked, the contents were soggy and tasted old. The sushi would have been better if the chef had taken the ingredients, put them down his pants, sat on them for 5 minutes while riding a bull, and then vomited on the resulting creation. Later the Panko Udon arrived, and it was even worse. I understand that it was panko breaded and not a tempura batter, but still it was absolutely horrendous. They could not have overcooked the vegetables, shrimp, and fish more.  It was greasy, bland, insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring.  The store bought, cheap as you can find udon was undercooked and had the texture of noodles that had been sitting for about 30 minutes in a colander. These little beauties were served in a pool of horrific bottled tsuyu sauce that left a lingering chemical aftertaste that was just a delight to behold.\n\nI would not eat here again even if my scrotum were stapled to a chair and I was chained to a table. I have to give this place one star too many because Yelp unfortunately has a one star minimum. I would even rate any fast food chain better than this place. I have had better airline food.\n\nCheers,\nUntil then, get the beers in...\nJust not at Shogun."""

The Katsu chicken was crisp and not over cooked and the roll was right on target. \n\nWe usually feel like we've been well fed, well served and reasonably priced.  The fish is alway fresh, the sushi chefs always accommodating to create a special version of a standard roll and the wait staff kept our glasses filled.\n\nI read some of the other reviews and feel that over the long run, some are off base - this is my perspective from over more than a few years of being a semi-regular dinner."""

"1,""Lim's Chinese Boofay is a throwback china boofay.  If you want seafood and spring rolls and vegetables and no MSG, you'd better head elsewhere.  If you remember going to a china boofay in 1979, back when nobody knew or cared that Chinese people never eat this stuff, and you loved the kitschy decor and salty fried food, then Lim's is your place.  I'll bet that the recipes and decor are the same as they've been for the last 30 years.\n\nYou've got your requisite fried rice, lo mein, beef/broccoli, sesame chicken, sweet&sour pork, egg foo young, eggrolls, fried chicken, and maybe a couple of other items beyond that.  Everything was cooked not so bad as far as the consistency on the Crispy-Greasy Spectrum, but had so much msg that my mouth literally had a buzzing feel when I left.  Not a taste, a FEELING, left over from the monosodium glutamate infused cuisine.  Blech.\n\nThe Discard Pile was actually tiny for the sesame chicken, but instead of honey it was flavored with syrup--cheapass imitaion ''maple'' corn syrup.  Still, I must admit it was lean chunks of white meat chicken, and was my favorite if I had to pick a poison.\nS&S pork looked lean, with large chunks of nonfatty meat, but the insides were a little gristly, and each bite in had about 20% come back out onto the Discard Pile.  Seems like they tried to keep it lean, though.\n\nIn the entire boofay table, there was hardly any color from veggies.  All I found was some icebertg lettuce and coleslaw in the cold section, plus brocolli in the beef&broc, carrots and onions in the S&S, and some white cabbage and a few onion pieces in the lo mein.  That's about it.  Oh, the egg rolls had cabbage inside, too, and Are the old school thick skinned, bubbly deep fried and mushy, not the spring roll thin skinned crispy kind.\n\nLim's had some decent flavors and I created a small Discard Pile, so could be a 3Star boofay by getting rid of the msg, using honey instead of syrup on the chicken, and adding a bunch more veggies into the mix.\n\n$6.25 lunch ($1.50 more for a soda) was not worth it, no matter how much volume you shove in.\n\nStill buzzing from the weird msg high.

We decided to order light and just order a  spicy tuna and salmon roll for each of us.  They were so hot we couldn't eat them.  My husband didn't think the rice was made that well.  My husband and I never go home with take out when we go out for Sushi.  Out of 12 pieces each, we each ate 4.  What does that tell you?

No one said,  \""""we're sorry, what can do we do for you to make it better\"""". \n\nMy children who are in their 20's tried it and also agreed with us.   They are both avid sushi eaters.

He said that his workers made it normal and that is the way they make it. They didn't put any extra hot spice in it.    I guess the customer is always wrong.

Then 3 days prior to our flight they told us they overbooked our flight and could only take 9 out of the 11 people they booked. After more than 15 calls to them including the corporate headquarters they said they absolutely would not compensate us for having to drive to our destination now, there was no way they could guarantee our flight unless arrived onsite 24 hours in advance (no more no less), and that they had no idea if or how they could refund our flight. Despite us having to miss our entire trip that cost thousands of dollars by telling us 3 days prior to our departure that they are unable to take us to our destination. They are also unfortunately the only airline that flys into this site. We arrived 3 hours before the plane took off, but they would not let us on the plane, and refused to refund our tickets. We lost all of the money, were stranded in page, and had to spend 400$ on a one way rental care to page. I would rather drive anywhere than deal with this airline ever again. Worst customer service.

I drive a long-bed crew cab truck so it's not like I ever expect it to be easy, but WTF? They have spaces facing a wall, which are easy to get to, but then have more spaces behind those for parallel parking and there isn't room for a go kart to back up when someone uses those other spaces. \n\nWhen you go inside it smells incredible, but when you get your food it just smells like pure butter. I am not even sure why I ate my dinner. It was a mix of ingredients that just didn't work. I had a carne asada burrito, probably not their specialty, but read enough of my reviews and you see thats almost all I eat. It was almost half beans, then a bunch of guacamole, and some very tasteless meat. It was a cardboard/bean/avocado burrito. The tortilla had so much damn butter on it that it tasted like a butter stick. I'm not looking forward to seeing my cardiologist report after this. \n\nProbably the one redeeming quality I see is the little 11 year old girl that was the cashier/order taker actually spoke english. The rest of the staff were not bi-lingual, and while they don't need to be, it seems funny that the entire menu is in English.

For the second 10 minutes, as I looked increasingly impatient while watching the staff member apparently program the space shuttle or possibly update his Facebook status for the 17th time, no indication of a problem and no apology for the time-wasting. For the third 10 minutes, there was a grunt about finding me a car of the appropriate reservation class, followed by an additional grunt about \""""this would have been a lot easier if you hadn't made your reservation in Hotwire\"""". Really? So if Budget accepts Hotwire reservations but has trouble processing them, that's the customer's fault?\n\nAlso - apparently the counter staff communicate with the car moving staff via push-to-talk cell phone. That's fine. Apparently the counter staff also do not know where the charger to said phone is, and spend lots of time yelling at each other about where it is.

It looks like they went to Kinkos, printed off whatever stock photo of a boat they found on Google and just stuck it to the back of the booths, stood back and said, \""""that works.\"""" \nAs a person who can't stand clutter, all of this together made me want to eat my tasteless food as quickly as possible and get back to my car and drive away, hopefully without being assaulted in the parking lot by said thug in the SUV.\n\nDO GO here if you are short on time, are on a budget and don't mind eating bland food in a cluttered chaotic restaurant, perhaps on your way to the ghetto strip club next door. DON'T GO here if you care about food and/or humanity."""

"2,""I brought my Moen white/ brass roman tub spout to be refinished brushed nickel to match my recently updated bathroom fixtures. Unfortunately, I discovered after leaving the tub project for last, Moen no longer makes a replacement for older spouts. My only options were to replace the entire tub and fixtures for $1000, keep the old fixtures that clashed with the new ones or have the spout re-plated.\n\nI was reluctant to use Papago Plating after reading some of the reviews on Yelp, but went ahead with the order anyway. If you are looking for immaculate antiseptic office\nthis may not be the place for you. However, the business looks like a typical small job-shop one might find anywhere. The lady that waited on me was very pleasant, knowledgeable and accurate with the final cost and completion date. It took one week and only cost $42. \n \nWow! Papago Plating did a fantastic job.

"2,""OKAY...\n\nSo on my connecting flight home, i once again landed at Sky Harbor. \nI had a great weekend, i was exhausted, and i suppose I didn't have much energy to hate on everything.\n\nSecond look at Sky Harbor, it's not so bad.  I suppose i wasn't in such a grumpy mood for having to stay here for 5 hours again.  Although I do still hold up to my previous statement that seating is a bit limited and that there aren't many food choices...but an airport is an airport right?  \n\nUnfortunately, I didn't get an opportunity to check out the Art Museum suggested by a fellow yelper (yes, they have an art museum!) but I was just glad to be on my way home. \n\nAnd this airport is HUGE. I was lucky enough to have landed in A second time around because my connector was in A, but last thursday, i landed in B and trekked all the way to A to reach my connector. It was quite a walk."""
"2,""Flying 10+ times a year on average, I couldn't do it out of any airport besides Sky Harbor.  Using terminal 4 exclusively, I've never had a wait longer than 10 minutes going through security (Flying out mainly on Friday afternoon or early Monday morning.)  Food choices are plentiful around the terminal inside and outside of security (I am disappointed Burger King doesn't have the BK Stacker there.)  People movers are a quick way to get around or you can tip the guy to drive you right to your gate.  The decor is nice and warm compared to others (SFO.)\n\nGetting here is very easy and the Cell lot is a great place to wait for arriving passengers.  The $2 for parking is worth it sometimes just to meet people at security so you don't feel so rushed to get baggage and say hello.  All and all, good job Phoenix."""

"1,""I try to avoid this airport at all costs while connecting to other destinations.  The terminals have no tram or train and are VERY far apart from each other.

"1,""Oh I am spoiled with the small-town feel of Tucson International--now if they wold only get some quality flights!!\nI've never flown out of Sky Harbor.  Seems like any other large-scale airport on the surface.\nSo why only two stars?  The driving around to find where to park is horrible.  They need to remember that most people don't frequent the airport.  So they should be obvious and deliberate with the signage.  \nAlso, the elevator from the parking garage to the terminals is a little confusing.  It literally went from floor 3, to 2, to B, to A, to 1.  Alpha-numerics embedded within themselves?  Again, keep it simple for us dummies who don't live the commuter jet-set lifestyle."""
"2,""\""""I'm goin goin back back to Cali Cali\""""...ok, I HAD to do that...moving on...!\n\nThe last thing anyone wants to do is be at the airport on the morning of Christmas Eve, hungover, and with a little less than three hours of sleep. However, Sky Harbor Intl. Airport made my absolutely horrendous morning bearable and then some.\n\nI was expecting long lines when I checked in my bags at Southwest but it was surprisingly fast and efficient. I felt that my things were in good hands. I thought, \""""this is too good to be true! Security has to have crazy long lines!\"""" Nope,  I was wrong. Security was a breeze. No lines. It all went by quite smoothly and it was nice of them to high-five me and wish me a safe flight. I think they could tell I was hungover and on zero sleep, but nevertheless, it was a sweet gesture.\n\nYou'd think at 8 a.m. there would be millions of people at the airport but it was surprisingly very quiet. Stopped to get some food and a much needed cup of coffee and before I knew it, I was on my way back to the bay. Thank you Sky Harbor for making my trip from AZ back to CA effortless and stress-free!"""
"1,""I strongly dislike this airport. I had to catch a connecting flight from Phoenix to Maui in another terminal. I had no idea I had to leave security, catch a bus, and then go through the TSA line again to get to the other terminal. I have an especially bitter taste in my mouth for Sky Harbor because this is where I lost my college class ring! In my mind the only redeeming part of Sky Harbor is Bar Fly, the coolest airport bar ever."""
"1,""Your basic airport. Nothing special to get excited about."""
"1,""Phoenix Sky Harbor, I've seen your plans for light rail connecting the terminals and the rental car center and they look glorious. 2015 can't come soon enough though --- the rental car center transportation (and the rental car center itself) as it is now is the worst I've seen.\n\nWhy is it the worst you ask?\n- the shuttles from the terminal to the RCC and from the RCC to the terminals wait until they are mostly full to leave which means you could be sitting on the shuttle for 15 minutes before it even gets moving. Other airports have no problem keeping their shuttles in the move.\n\n- there are a lot early flights out of PHX (like get to the airport no later than 4am flights) and there are hardly any staff around at that time so everything us slower than usual. The last thing I want to do is get up even earlier to deal with that...\n\n- the garages are massive and not well signed... You keep driving and driving in it trying to leave or return your car thinking, did I miss it? Until 8 minutes later you see a sign with tiny lettering pointing you in the next direction.\n\nAll I can say, fellow Yelpers, is that I wish you luck and recommend you build an extra 30-45 minutes if airport time into your trip if you're renting a car.\n\nThe airport itself is fine. Not a huge airport, the food options are regular old airport food options. The baggage claim/ticketing/security areas are all fine. Nothing special or awesome but no real complaints. The nice thing about flying through PHX is that there are rarely flights delays due to weather!"""
"1,""The airport is clean and looks like its been recently renovated. I'm not really fond that the rental car location is 10  minutes away though. Also, i dislike how you have to do a full body scan and get your fingers swiped for bomb stuff.. its like... really? out of all the airports ive been to, this is the only one that made me do it. lastly, the US airways employee at the airport booked me the wrong flight.!!! she gave me a ticket but when she put us in teh system, it was to a different place. we ended up staying in phoenix another night since there were no more flights back to so.cal.. NOT COOL! AND, they wouldnt even cover the cost of the hotel. They only offered a discount.. suppppppper lame!"""
"1,""Poor service, long check-in process and time...total hassle. Will never, ever rent from them again."""
"1,""I hate this airport more than I could ever tell you. Sure, the wifi is free, and progress through the security checkpoint is brisk, but these are the only positive things I can say about PHX. The food sucks, the buses are confusing, getting out of here is a giant pain in the butt, and if you are a Continental customer you will be relegated to the Continental Ghetto (Terminal 2) which is by far the grossest, dingiest, most run-down of the bunch. The best part of coming to Sky Harbor is flying to another state."""
"1,""Very confusing airport.  For an International Airport, I would have expected a more luxury feel.  Definitely not the airport you would want to get stuck for hours in.  I flew southwest and Gate C and D did not have great restaurant choices or stores to look in.  You have to walk what feel likes miles to buy a water or grab a magazine, and food."""
"2,""I'm a Flight Attendant based here, so I'm here quite a bit.  I love how easy it is to access Sky Harbor from the Freeways and 44th St., so it's always quick to get in and get out.  Parking is also easy.\n\nThe TSA folks tend to be fairly nice here, but be warned that the customs area is very, very small and you can get held up for a while when the once-daily British Airways 747 lands."""
"2,""Sky Harbor is a good airport, it really is, but no match for my beloved Tucson International. I can't recall many poor experiences here, thank god! It's easy to get through, not too massive, nor too small (but Iike small). It's a pleasant airport. But Sky Harbor smells like Cinnabon and Burger King on every corner and every terminal, so I'm sorry, but I'm knocking a star for that! I don't mind the pizza hut smell though :) If Sky Harbor got a little facelift in the food department, I'd be glad to give a sold 5 stars!"""
"1,""It's an airport, and you don't (ordinarily) spend a lot of time there, so why review? First, on the arrival, our baggage took an INORDINATELY long time to come out. It was just ridiculous. I am accustomed to long waits at DFW (where no one actually works in baggage retrieval). But here it was even worse. There was no organization and throngs of people stood around and then scurried to another carousel as changes were announced. We waited and waited and waited forever. The second gripe is that the TSA seems to be inconsistent with practices followed in every other airport I have used in the rest of the US. That may be the TSA and not the airport's fault, but why here? Overall, my experience was less than favorable."""
"1,""Putrid. Pathetic.  Podunk.\n\nToo big not to have some method of transportation of from the jets to the puddle jumpers. I check everything except a computer bag and purse so that's fine but God forbid you fly carry-on and don't have a wheely bag. \n\nI was wearing brand new tennis shoes--Saucony--and still it was a long walk after the NY flight landed late. If your destination is Scottsdale and you're coming from LA or SF or SB and don't want to drive, then fine. To transfer through this Third World dump--having been warned--well, you get what you deserve. \n\nWhen I got to SB, I met a Ph.D. in English who went through program after I did but is my age who told me that this was her least favorite airport in America and that the only reason she flew US Air was that it saved her over 300 dollars so she figured she would suck it up. \n\nThe carpet should have been on that famous Dateline segment about germs as it looks like the 1980s carpet which used to be in the outside ladies' locker room at Santa Barbara Athletic Club which caters to swimmers. (Whoever decided carpet would be a good idea in the swimmers' locker room needs immediately to get out of the interior design or consulting biz, by the way.) \n\nThere are no words for how bad this place is. It makes Punta Cana, Dominican Republic look like the Maui Four Seasons. The food sucks. The US gate people suck and they don't speak Spanish and I had to help this wonderful, older Mexican couple get on the plane to SB after they'd missed the connection to Santa Maria and NO US Air gate attendants (NOT flight attendants who might be from anywhere) could speak the language a huge percentage of Phoenix residents do. \n\nI am merely repeating the sentiments of Charles S: \""""Old, ugly, worn out and dirty. Time to replace the carpet and the furniture, y'all.\"""""""
"2,""Crazy busy airport with long wait times at security. Plan ahead! \n\nThat said however, this is a pretty decent airport. There are plenty of food options with both local and national chains, there are cute stores to buy Southwest themed treats, toys and take-homes, and the walkways (once you're through security) are pretty wide. I also found the bathrooms to be tidy as well as the carpets in the gate areas. I know that's odd to mention but dirty carpets really gross me out and this airport seems to be nicer than many I've been to recently. Go PHX!"""
"1,""Wish I could have avoided this airport not going to lie...  doing the 3 total hours I was here I heard over 5 different delays on arrivals and departures.  the pictures help out ALLOT....  it sums it up long hall ways with nothing to look at in them halls either...  it takes about 10-20 minutes to walk from 1 end to the other and during that walk, i'd like to at least listen to some music or something but they had nothing...\nMaybe its because I'm so use to Denver International Airport \""""DIA\"""" but this airport doesn't even compare.\nJust Saying"""
"2,""I mainly fly out of Terminal 2 and 4 (guess my alliance... ha!), so that's what all my opinions are based on.\n\nTerminal 4 is larger/newer and now has the SkyTrain from the economy parking to it, which is surprisingly more convenient than I though, so maybe it's not a complete waste of money. Although, you still need to take shuttles to the rest of the terminals.\nThe signage is rather clear for the most part, but if you are part of any of the premium boarding groups, sometimes the signs are either not very clear or missing. Seems to have gotten better lately though. Baggage claim area has large screens telling you which carousel has your flight's luggage (foreshadowing for Terminal 2 right here). If you are being picked up by someone, remember that there is both a North and a South side of the arrivals area, so be clear where you are going to be right away, besides just naming the door number.\n\nTerminal 2 should just be a regional airport of its own. It sure got the conveniences of one. The signage for initial security check point is Flight Crews, First class and the rest. Do note, First Class is actually for most Premier flyers and TSA PreCheck as well. Not that anyone can tell you that.\nThe 4 baggage claims carousels (in theory) show the flight number of where the luggage is coming from, but so far it at best displays late, or more often is announced over the speaker and for most fun occasions, on the wrong carousel altogether. At the very least, there is only one side to the terminal, so you don't have to tell North/South to your heat stricken friends when they pick you up.\n\nFood/entertainment choices are nothing exception in either of the terminals and are typical airport food."""
"1,""Awful place to have a layover. This airport is always overcrowded, hence, there is little seating and you'll likely find yourself squished between two strangers until your flight. To avoid the crowd, I recommend grabbing a book and finding a restaurant with bar seating to enjoy some quiet and a few drinks before boarding."""
"1,""Been flying in and out of this airport for the past 6 yrs.  The only positive thing about this place is that it's right off the freeway.  With that said, they have the ABSOLUTE worst check-in process at the security gate.  There's no getting around it.  You'll be in line for a solid 45 min to an hour so plan accordingly."""
"1,""This place just brings the rage out in me. It NEVER fails..whenever I have a layover here, my flight gets pushed back three times for an average delay of 3-4 hours...so you don't get out of there till almost 1am!! For a DOMESTIC flight! Thanks, US Airways! \n\nThe food court is pretty gross, still. The staff at the Starbucks over by B15A is pretty rude and then the departure screens don't update when your gate has been changed. I usually end up extremely stressed out by the time I'm outta this hell hole. Sadly, PHX is ALWAYS the place I have to connect through to get home because US Airways seems to love torturing their guests with this location. And...for an airport in an extremely hot place, how do you not have your HVAC system working properly?!"""
"2,""Our flight was on time! That right there is enough to give any airport at least 3 stars. On top of that, we ran into no problems with anything! Even the TSA agents were friendly, which is totally unusual yet very much appreciated! There's not much as far as food is concerned if you go in the morning"
"2,""Dropped off my cousin here for their flight to California. The parking is not a hassle and a lot of things has changed since I remembered back in high school. Everything was under construction, caution tape everywhere, and just looked unappealing. Taking the time to actually tour around the place it is pretty nice and impressive. You got a variety of stores, lounging areas, and of course the restaurants. Very nice because it is still improving and still building more restaurants there. \n\nThe baggage and check in stations are very easy to do and don't need much help. That is a big part for me because airports can be very busy so the less time checking in the better. So, overall, I'd have to say even though I haven't been to a lot of airports Sky Harbor by far has to be one of the best in categories ranging from being clean, exceptional service, and having a variety of stores/restaurants."""
"1,""Worst airport for baggage claim. They move carousels all the time and take forever to deliver the bags. Should be so much easier than what they make it."""
"2,""Big airport.  Reasonably efficient for its size.  Way better than O'Hare for general amenities"""
"2,""Its ok. Its an airport, and a stereotypical one at that. It has long lines and a lot of traffic, expensive chain restaurants, and shops. Nothing special. Customer Service is passable and they do a good job as expected, however it is a typical airport. No muss or fuss."""
"2,""On more than one occassion I have had to park here. It is not a bad price, but now I see they have coupons, and I am going to have to start getting those.\nWe are all into not spending too much $4 lately. \nWell, at least this week, hee hee.\n Anyway,  had cut my time short on my last trip. So I did not think that I would be able to make my check in time for my flight. But, I got there parked ,got to level 3 and thru security with time to spare.\nGreat I know~!\nFast ,quick and easy. I just need to get those coupons and fast."""
"2,""Okay, this was my first time at Phoenix Greyhound Park and my first time watching dog races (unless I can count watching All Dogs Go to Heaven - because I have seen that countless times). Any ways, I would definitely go again and I would totally recommend Phoenix Greyhound Park. \n\nLike I said, I have never done this before - so I had no clue how to bet or what to bet on. There was this VERY helpful man named Chuck who broke down the beats to me and my friend and really helped us get started. I won 5 times, but still walked away $6 short from when I started...it takes real skill to be that good... :o) At first, since I didn't really know what I was doing, the races were a little confusing to me, but after 4 hours and a few wins later, I was yelling my dismay and excitement with the rest of the crowd! At about 10pm (when my friend and I assumed the old folks home buses came and packed up their clientele) The atmosphere was still lively and it was still fun! Though, I would say that's because 99% of the people who were there were probably also pure blood Hockey and Nascar fans...so they know how to have fun (in their own way! :)) \n\nTo say the least I had a blast with the betting, dog races and family friendly environment - the reason for my mid-rating has more to do with the quality of food service. I think we saw our waitress about 4 times the whole 5 hours we were there...when the food finally came it was really good (don't waste your money on the desserts), but I was thirsty pretty much the whole time. I'm giving them a little bit of a break because I think for the whole room (200 tables) they only had 2 waitresses, so they were spread thin and we were up and down making our bets any ways. \n\nOh, and by the way, when you go, be a big spender and pay the $3 bucks a person and go up stairs, that's where all the fun is (and you get to ride the escalator)!"""
"1,""Wow, what a horrible experience. So bad that I had to cancel my reservation for my stay on the way back.\n\nI stayed here with my two children for one night in March. We got in kind of late and checked in around 9:30 pm. Check-in was fine. We let the clerk know we needed a ride to the airport in the morning and it turns out that you can leave your car there if you're planning to stay on your return trip and the stay is 14 days or less (I asked after a friend informed me you can do this--beats paying for airport parking!). We were flying to Hawaii and would be gone for 10 days, so this was a good deal.\n\nOur room was on the ground floor and was not nicer than a Motel 6 as far as I remember Motel 6s being from when I was a kid. It was hot and humid in the hotel so I turned on the AC. That clanky piece of crap managed to wake me up every single time it went on during the night. A HORRIBLE night of sleep.\n\nTo make matters worse, there were a bunch of college-aged drunk kids staying in the hotel who showed up around 10:30 pm. They hung out right outside of my door and were up and down the stairs laughing and being obnoxious until 1 am. I typically am not shy about sticking my head out the door and telling people to be quiet, but since I was alone with my kids, I didn't think it was the best idea. I called the front desk around 11 pm and they said their driver (who doubles as security) would drive back there when he returned from the airport, in about 20 minutes. It was not 20 minutes, that's for sure. Considering we had to be up at 5 am, waiting ANY amount of time was infuriating. They should have had someone on the premises who can act in the capacity of a security guard or something. I heard the van drive by around 1 am and that's when the inconsiderate a-holes finally went up to their rooms.\n\nIn the morning (at 5 am) I couldn't help myself and as we were heading to the front desk to catch the shuttle, I knocked loudly on one of the doors of the worst offenders and called them jerks. Passive aggressive, I know, but whatever. In the lobby, while waiting for the shuttle, I heard other guests complaining about the loud jerks, too.\n\nThe shuttle ride was fine"
"2,""Hotel was extremely accommodating and the staff was very helpful. The airline lost our tickets after wed checked out and the next flight wasn't for 8 hours. Not only did they send a shuttle to pick us up bit they also let us check back into our room."""

"1,""I want to start off with saying that everytime I drove by stockyards and saw that giant bull/cow on the top of the big, plain, white building, I always imagined it being a casual steakhouse with straw or peanut shells on the ground. \n\nIt's totally not.  It is like a rich Texan's house inside.  Cow rug, leather, old cowboy photos on the wall.  So the ambiance inside is totally nice and upscale-cowboy feel.  We got sat in the main dining room and I also want to add like I felt like the place was \""""dusty\"""" I don't know why, or what made me feel this way, but \""""dusty\"""" was what I got from the place.  I ordered a half slab of ribs with garlic potatoes and a salad. Travis got a burger with fries.

We finished our meals and got up to see their famour bar that is completely hand carved and the murals on the walls are hand-painted and restored from like the 1900's so the bar was very cool. \n\nGo for a drink at the bar.

"1,""I would give 0 stars if I could!  I am in the process of relocating from Phoenix to Seattle and due to the last minute notice of the move, I had initially moved out to Seattle with my car a month prior and then flew back to Phoenix to pack all my belongings and officially move to Washington. I knew that I would be needing a car while in Phoenix, and was really excited about the cheap deal I had found to rent a car with advantage. When I arrived at Advantage, I was told that because my driver's license still had an address of Phoenix I needed to provide a copy of my insurance in order to rent the car, which was not possible for me to obtain because it was located in Washington.  The rental reservation had been made two week prior, and no notice of this policy had been communicated to me. I explained my situation and the service attendant apologized and said that there was nothing they could do, which left me carless and having to go to another company and pay over 5x the amount."""
"1,""We turned to Greyhound to get from Phoenix to Tucson. We were going to rent a car, but picking up in Phoenix and dropping off in Tucson for 5 days was over $600 at one of the cheaper rental car agencies. That seemed crazy, so we bought one-way tickets on Greyhound for 3 passengers for about $40. \n\nWas there a better deal online? Interestingly enough, the internet special costs more. \n\nWould we save money on our tickets if we purchased ahead? No, but Mr. L bought our tickets a week ahead anyway, since the 2:30pm Sunday bus was the only time that actually worked for us. He printed out our tickets, which said we were confirmed. That Sunday would be Daylight Savings, but it was Arizona, which didn't have a time change.\n\nThat Sunday when we showed up at 2pm for our 2:30pm bus, we learned that they'd changed the time to 1:30pm. The Daylight Savings in other states affected the schedule. We should have confirmed our \""""confirmed\"""" tickets. The station agent changed us to a 5:30pm bus, and we were bummed that we'd have a few hours to kill and miss out on time with Mr. L's parents. And they'd have to find the bus station in the dark - shoot.\n\nLesson learned? Buying tickets ahead with Greyhound isn't the best idea. If you do, confirm them, as the schedule may change.\n\nWith hours to kill in the Greyhound Station, my son started playing video games at $1 a pop, and Mr. L and I gathered our thoughts. There was some scary looking food sitting under heat lamps in the Cactus Caf\u00e9. We rented two lockers to stow our luggage for $3 each for 3 hours and split in a cab for a while to go anywhere but the bus station.\n\nWhen we returned closer to our new departure time, the lines for the buses were confusing. The line for Tucson was not the line for our bus. It seemed like everything was backwards here. Luckily we asked, or we might've missed our bus again. By the time we boarded our bus, many seats were taken. Ichabod headed to the back of the bus, and a kind gentleman cleared the 3-seat rear spot for us. \n\nThere was a bathroom near the back, which Mr. L suggested I avoid entering. He said it was a basic hole (outhouse style) with an empty jar of hand-sanitizer. Good to have the bare-bones bathroom if you really need it, but ick.\n\nThe driver made a bunch of announcements in English, then in Spanish. He meant business. I was glad when he told passengers to use headsets for their music, since initially a nearby passenger graced us with his music. Now we only got to see his seated dance moves, which were actually pretty good. \n\n+2 affordable prices\n+2 capable driver\n-2 changing the schedule after had a \""""confirmed\"""" ticket\n-1 for only one agent working the line \n+2 having a bathroom on bus\n-1 condition of bathroom\n+1 lockers in Greyhound station\n-1 for the clusterf*ck of confusion of lines to get on buses - advanced degrees don't help here, be ready to ask questions\n\nGrand total: 2 stars\n\nOverall, we were glad not to spend over $600 on a rental car or inconvenience our friends or family by asking for a very long ride. We learned that we need to confirm or buy tickets last-minute like most Greyhound riders. Hanging out in a Greyhound station is not my idea of fun. We would ride Greyhound again, but proceed with caution."""

"2,""We only go here for their Walnut Chicken Salad sandwich and cookies. I should probably reverse the order of that because the cookies are the real treat and we always take advantage of their two for one cookies.  A pet peeve we have is that the staff is trained to remind people that they already get a chocolate chip cookie with their sandwich  when they order an EXTRA chocolate chip cookie, so it is always like a \""""who's on first\"""" banter until they figure out we really do want EXTRA chocolate chip cookies. Their staff seems to turn over a lot here so it is hard to deprogram them. We stop here EVERY time we are headed out of town anywhere near lunch time. Paradise is like a treat we look forward to before we get on an airplane. If we are running late, we just get it to go and eat on the airplane and make everyone jealous that they did not stop at Paradise too...especially when we pull the cookies out of the bag! Yum! They have recently opened another satellite location in Terminal 4 out by the C11-20 gates. We usually stop at the main one on Level 3."""
"1,""I love the idea of loving this place.  I really do.  And to be honest, if I was reviewing this place on it's own merits and not the clientele - I'd probably give it 3 stars as it delivers what it promises.  \n\nThis place is an old horse track through and through.  Fun way to waste an afternoon and decent amount of money on sucker bets.  Beer is not overly expensive and if you catch it on $1 hotdog night - you can add gluttony to your list of sins for the day.\n\nThat said, this place is an old horse track through and through.  Desperate need of a face lift when it comes to the grandstand / restrooms.  \n\nLastly, I really wish this place was 18+ or at least had rules about children being left unattended.  As it has neither (or least doesn't enforce either) this is a playground for FANTASTIC parents who let their children go Lord of Fly's while they gamble away their afternoon.

"2,""I called Monday morning during a heat wave and said that our unit was not cooling down as much as it should a hot afternoon.  They said they either could come out in the afternoon or the next day, which--considering we still had a/c and it was cool at night--was fine.  They did keep in touch (it was the next day), and I found the technician to be on-time and responsive.  (Some freon just needed to be added.)  The service call was $65 and the lb. of freon $25, so it was very reasonable.  He told me the techs work by the hour and not on commission like some companies, so they don't try to sell you something they don't need.  I definitely would use this company again."""

"1,""We didn't order from this Domino's.   Southwest Airlines ordered for us and about 100+ other passengers that were stuck at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport for about 5-6 hours.  I believe they ordered 75-80 pizzas and it did turn out to be enough to feed all of us.   \n\nWhen the Domino's people showed up, some were ready to hug them, cause they were hungry.  And I will admit I was one of them.   We had so much weight in carry on luggage that trying to go get food was difficult, so what was offered free by Southwest was welcome.     I believe they sent 4 employees and used an airport cart to bring all the pizzas in.  The pizzas were not very hot, just lukewarm and that's no surprise as I don't think their ovens can rotate over 20 large pizzas at a time and we as a group had at least 3 or 4 times that many.   The pizza also had that signature cardboard smell and taste of the dominos boxes, but at the time it was so damn good.    \n\nThey didn't bring enough cheese packets and no red pepper, but there were enough napkins, people were very civil in line and we had enough to eat for hours.   It was even still acceptable after it was cold as room temp.   And anyone that has ever been in college knows that room temp pizza is just fine.   "

"1,""Terrible experience. I wish I could give negative stars or no stars. Placed an online order and paid with a credit card recently. The driver was 20 mins late! The pizza and wings were not hot.

The person that answered advised that they were busy, didn't apologize and supposedly gave a $5 credit for our next order. \n\nDays later, looked at my credit card account statement and was CHARGED AN EXTRA $3!!!! This is CC fraud! Best believe I contacted this location very upset. Supposedly they are firing the delivery driver because we are the second caller to report this kind of incident. Makes me wonder how many other innocent people they are doing this to and other things. Businesses like this do not deserve to be open. If this is a franchised location, shame on the person running this. This is not a way to run a business.

"2,""I just found something else incredible about Ranch Market, and I'm going to have to up it to 5 stars as a result. Wednesdays are special produce days, which means that tons of different produce items are on special for 3 pounds for $.99. Yes, my friends. $.99. \n\nI had seen the special pricing advertised on the flyers we get every now and then, but had been hesitant to make a special trip there in case the produce was bad-quality or ran out after, say, 10 am. Well, I went today around 1 pm, and I can tell you that the produce is neither bad-quality or gone after 10 am. There were tons of the special advertised items, and 90% looked super-fresh. \n\nI left with 2-3 pounds of bananas, tomatoes, peaches, key limes, and avocados, all of which cost me a mere $5.62. And just think - just yesterday, I spent $2 for 3 tomatoes at Whole Foods. I'll definitely be back at least every other Wednesday to snag some of these special deals."""

Bragging about their *authentic* Greek gyros, I thought, surely they would compare to our great Greek restaurants in the pacific northwest serving delicious food that will make me want to cry.  Sadly, I wanted to cry but not in the way I had hoped.\n\nTheir servings are huge and you do get plenty for what you pay for.  Their gyros are gigantic and they don't skimp on the lamb or chicken.  But the flavor was a bit off.  It just wasn't up to par with other gyros I've had and it didn't come with lettuce!  I ordered their Greek salad w/chicken kabob and although the chicken was charbroiled just right, the flavor was again a bit off.  Also, I wasn't a fan of their tzatziki sauce.  It was a bit runny and tasteless for me.\n\nWhat really turned me off about this place was that we ate lunch here at 3p and Jay's closes at 4p.  Why did the owner and family begin to start cleaning the tables and giving us dirty looks at 3:30 making us feel like it was time to leave?  With their mediocre salad and inhospitality, I humphed my way out of the A/C and into the outside furnace."""

That shows you what my list of unfinished reviews looks like.  So here's my review from my August 2011 visit.  Rest assured, it was so traumatizing I can accurately remember the pertinent details.\n\nAfter my kitty suffered a severe seizure, losing her eyesight, the emergency clinic recommended a neuro consult as they were unable to pinpoint the cause.    So we loaded up our already deaf, now blind, and extremely pissed off family member into the car and  headed from one hospital to another.\n\nThe facility is in an odd industrial area, but it was very clean and the staff friendly.  We were greeted promptly and had a minimal wait.  Suzi was first thoroughly examined by an resident.  She was minimally cooperative, but he was good with her.  He then took her to another room for a second examination by a neurologist, Dr. Evans.  We were not offered the opportunity to accompany Suzi, but we were not exactly at the top of her list anyway.  Following Dr. Evan's exam, he did meet with us to report his findings.  His best guess was a brain tumor, but in absence of an MRI, he could not be certain.  We discussed treatment options"

"1,""I went to Baseline Dental for cleaning and the annual x-rays. The last time I went there was in summer of 2012. I have no issues with the Dr. Payne and the Hygienists, but I definitely have an issue with their communication on charges for something as simple as a filling. \n\nIn summer of 2012 I was told that I needed 2 fillings and that I would only have to pay $48 out of pocket, while my Insurance will cover the rest of it. The amount they quoted seemed reasonable (I also double-checked with a Dentist friend of mine who runs her own practice in NY). I get the work done, and a month later the real drill begins!\n\nI started getting letters from their collections department saying I owed them another $218. This is after I had already paid them $48 that they told me I owed when I got the treatment done. I paid that amount the day of my treatment and thought I was done! Magically, a month later, they realized they needed to charge me more! I called my Insurance company and was told that the Dentist is charging more than the normal amounts, and that the Insurance will only cover what's reasonable! \n\nMy issue is that a) Baseline Dental needs to charge competitive rates, charges that Insurance company won't refuse to pay, and b) If they get turned down by the Insurance company, stop harassing the patient who actually paid the amount they were asked to at the time of the treatment! \n\nOf course, I called numerous times in Fall of 2012 to get this charge off, wasted hours as I got transferred from one department to another. Baseline Dental wants to rip off their patients so bad (either thru the Insurance or directly harassing the patient), that last year they filed collection on my account for the $218. Luckily, my credit history is really good, and this hasn't impacted me much. However, I am severely disappointed at the greed a business can have, and how this greed and their practice of over-charging has turned a regular patient away! \n\nNote: I still live within a mile of this business, but refuse to go back there as a result of their unprofessional behavior. I will be going there one more time in person to sort things out, but after over a year and half of this battle, I wanted to share this with yelp and get the word out!"""
"1,""There were such mixed reviews that I had to find out for myself.

When someone orders wings, they take it out of the fridge and place the container in the oven to heat it up. Therefore, unable to take special requests.\nThe pizza arrived piping hot but I had asked for well done with the cheese brown and bubbly. The cheese was melted. I have to agree with the other reviews, there was an odd taste to the sauce and cheese. I'm from Wisconsin so I can taste real, quality cheese. This was very odd tasting \""""cheese\"""". \nThe wings were absolutely disgusting. Barely warm. I put them under the broiler after they were delivered and they still tasted rubbery. The skin was drenched in sauce but unable to get crispy, even after my broiler attempt. Very fatty.\nOn a positive  note, the delivery was quick. I wish they would have taken the extra time to at least make an effort to make the customer happy. Honestly, (and my own personal opinion because I'm no expert) I dont think the wings were even at health dept standards. \nThis was the worst $30 I've ever spent. I encourage people to do more research before settling on Gino's. I'll never order from here again."""

Ramon you are great at what you do!\n  Now we are at the most important part of the journey, the food, which was delicious. We ordered sever different types of sushi: Eel, Blue Fin, Egg and Octopus. Lets start with the bad first, Octopus... I personally hate it, always chewy, tough and so citrusy i cant bear it. So thats the bad, now for the good. Blue Fin melted in your mouth with the consistency of firm butter and was excellent. The Egg was great aswell, sweet with a back end of head dizzying sake(not over bearing but noticable if you dont drink.)\n  Now for my favorite part of the meal, Eel, saying that I am an eel lover is an understatment, I dream of good eel, all I can say is that I was impressed and thats the highest compliment I could ever give to eel because I've never had bad eel. Also had a crunchy eel roll that was superb.\n  My wife ordered Calimari and Ramen both of which were delicous aswell, the sauce for the calimari was my favorite part of the plate. As for the ramen, if you want good authentic ramen with a smell that will cause people to come up to you and ask you what that is that you ordered, look no further.\n  All that for under $40 WHAT?! ive paid over a hundred for far worse!\n  After years of searching I have finally found my sushi destination. Thank you Ramon for the many wonderful times you have provided us with we will be back soon!\n\nP.S. I have never left that place with out atleast one thing gratis(fish ribs were great but im too lazy to eat them...)"""
"1,""This is no longer here. Boo.\nReally needed to go and it's as though it never existed!"""
"2,""Love the pancakes. Love the coffee. And they make my eggs EXACTLY how I order them. \n95% of the wait staff are prompt & efficient. The other 5%, well, I actually haven't seen them the last few times I've been here (maybe they found more suitable employment). \nMost if the menu items are very tasty and inexpensive but there are a few items I won't order. \nOverall, this is my favorite \""""fast food\"""" joint."""
"1,""The service is terrible, It took at least an hour for my table to get our food after ordering it. Not to mention it is cold inside, and uncomfortable. The food was average."""
"1,""OK i had to write a review because I was very disappointed!\n\nI gave this place the benfit of the doubt only because i heard they had a great happy hour and it is a brewery! Plus they only had 3 stars when i looked over the yelp reviews, I wanted to help improve that......Big mistake .....I should've listened to my fellow yelpers. I decided to have my birthday dinner here on a friday, we decided we would meet early for happy hour then move to dining area for dinner. Well my small party of 4 got there around 6:15pm, we thought it was just in time to put in a quick order for cheap food and drinks, but it took forever to find an available server, one guy stopped by and said he'll be \""""back in a sec\"""" but never did. So we decided to move to the patio where we thought it would be easier to put in our order, the lady taking orders was nice enough to put our order in 2 minutes before it ended. We were rushed and didnt even have the HR menus to look over because they guy never gave us them and there weren't any on the patio table. She was also pretty slow at getting them, i'm sure we would've had 4 minutes to order if she knew the urgency of HR ending at 6:30pm!!  Come on now.....There were alot of older people and it got pretty dead after HR ended..\n\nAfter that we moved to the dining area where other members of our party met us. The menu looked good from the pictures and description they gave....but the beer selection was very limited. :( White ale, red ale, dark ale??? ok.. at least put some personality into naming them and make sure your server is educated on each beer.\n\nOver all the food sucked and beer sucked. No taste in either one.. It was a sad birthday dinner, yes i ate all my food because i was starving! I didnt get sick so that's good.... We had one beer/drink each and regreted the beer choice after the first sip, we left right away to get a real drink. Oh I did have a choice of either a free cake or drink for my Bday, I chose the carrot cake.. it was good, not the best. She just sat it down on the table said happy birthday then walked off......uh thanks yay happy birthday to me... oh and she charged us for the cake.. but corrected it after we mentioned it.\n\n I know better now to stick with the good ol' Four Peaks Brewery for GREAT Food and Beer!  They have an extensive selection of beer to choose from, even if it isn't made in their brewery!\n\nServers/ hostess were nice, except for mr. invisable... \n\nJust dont go....maybe for HR but you wont taste much:(\n\n*Excuse my spelling and sentences, just so much happened and I can't think right trying to get it all out!"""
"1,""What happened to this place? We have been here quite a few times and this last visit will probably be the last. We had bad service from the get go. No one sat us right away the servers were walking by looking at us but no host came. I had trouble finding anything on the menu that on a hot day in phoenix sounded good. Everything is pricey too for being so-so food. Salads are $10 and up. A trip to the bathroom grossed me out with greasy smudged hand prints all over the black stall doors. Walking back I noticed the floors were covered in crumbs and food. Our little boy dropped something under our table and let's just say they can keep it because it was filthy under there. \nNo more rock bottom for us!"""
"2,""The breakfast burrito never disappoints and the kids love the pancakes. Nice selection of coffee and bagels keeps everyone in the family satisfied. A little pricey but the food quality is good. For Ahwatukee it's probably 5 stars but sine there are better places around Phoenix its a 4. They should expand into a bigger space as this places gets crowded in a hurry."""
"1,""Very disappointing! There are much better places to go for bagels and breakfast stuff.The service is lacking both in efficiency and friendliness. Actually the girl behind the counter was rude and discourteous.\nThe food was just ok nothing special\nThe best thing about eating there is I don't ever have to eat there again\nCan't imagine they'll be in business for long\nYuk :("""

"2,""Great service, friendly staff, great food and excellent atmosphere. Portions are a bit small for the price.  This will be a regular spot!!"""
"2,""Had a wonderful party at this place last night for a friend.  The back patio is perfect for this time of year with a nice private and relaxing feel.  The food was creative and wonderful and the wine was the perfect temp.  \n\nA musician by the name of Blaine Long was playing on the patio and the guy just blew me away.  All original music, great style and feel, and he knows how to control volume and tone so damn well.  Certainly the best musician I have heard in an Arizona bar/restaurant after living here for 15 years.  \n\nI will certainly be back to experience an evening without the party.  The staff was very good and professional.  They thought of everything the guests could need including blankets for a baby when the temps dropped."""
"2,""This place is perfect for a date night! Happy hour includes some yummy apps (my fave is the bruschetta) and discounted glasses of wine. There's space to sit at the bar, high top tables, as well as booths. I suggest going on the nights where there is live music to fully enjoy the experience. The servers are friendly and knowledgeable and there is absolutely nothing pretentious about this wine bar. Go try it out!"""
"1,""Went in a few nights ago. Food and staff was average. The restaurant however is a mess. The tile around salsa bar is dirty and chipped,windows dirty, dusty and sign printed out and stuck on wall. The restaurant to me looks like it's been written off. It's in a hidden location. If the front end looks that bad, I would hate to see the back. Very disappointing to see a good brand let a unit get that disheveled."""
"1,""I had a DUI a few years ago and based on this law office's great \""""client testimonials\"""" they could get out of my situation.  8 months later and $5,000.00 lighter in the pocket i was being told by my attorney \""""Here, sign this.

"1,""If I have to review the food alone, I will give it a one star.  The service is prompt and courteous so I'll give it an extra one star.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.  We had a reservation and was seated promptly.  The waiter came and greeted us, gave us the menu and everything went well.\n\nAppetizer: We started with the Alp & Dell Cheese Fondue which is a white wine and Gruyere, Raclette and Fontina Cheese Fondue. It tasted two dimensional, exactly garlicky and salty.  The raw cauliflower and carrot which I usually love to eat tasted bitter with the cheese.\n\nSalad: We went with California Salad which is mixed salad greens with raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  The salad came very watery, very very sweet and it was swimming in the dressing. We could not even finish it off.\n\nMain Course: This is the worse of all the courses. We picked the pacific rim cooked in coq au vin broth.  It came with Teriyaki Marinated Sirloin, Citrus Pork Tenderloin, Shrimp, Chicken, Pot sticker, Mushroom, and Veggies.  We deliberately chose coq au vin broth even though it cost more because we read here that it's worth it. Everything tasted bland and that citrus pork and teriyaki sirloin tasted very weird, sour and salty and not in a good way at all.  The chicken and the shrimp also tasted bland.  It really tasted like boiled chicken meat that's a bit salty. Their solution?  Dip it in our sauce: Teriyaki, Sweet and Sour and Yogurt based curry sauce.  The sauces tasted like cheap sauces you can find in a bottle in any grocery stores. It has no character, no complexities,  very very disappointing.  Oh yeah, this is what our waitress said,  just cook everything about 2 minutes or so, don't worry if you don't time it correctly, it's impossible to overcook anything here, just leave it on the pot and that's fine.  This is not just the cooking instruction for  our table.  We can hear that every table get the same cooking instructions from different waiter/waitress.  The problem is not overcooking for us, but it just tasted bland.\n\nDessert: We chose the Smore with Dark Chocolate Fondue.  This is the best part out of this horrible feast.  It comes with Strawberry, Graham Cracker, Marshmallow, Cheesecake, Pound Cake and Rice Crispies to dip it with. First, the strawberry was fresh, marshmallow was great, graham cracker was crunchy.  Now come the bad part, the part that they had to make: The rice crispies was kinda stale, the pound cake was crumbling like a week old cake, and the cheesecake was just meh.  We suddenly realized that the part that was good, they did not have to make( ie: the strawberry, the cracker and the marshmallow).  The part that they had to make tasted bad( ie: the crispies, cheesecake, pound cake).  \n\nWe do not mind splurging on our foods on special occasion.  We realize that it takes a lot of efforts to make special dishes.  This is seriously lacking in everything, cheap basic material for the food, horrible taste, and no cooking method involve at all by the kitchen.  Why are we paying that much again?  I don't mind paying $100 for a meal if it is cooked properly and tastes great.  It's not the price at all, it's just there is no value to this meal."""
"2,""Loved this date, the food was pretty much what I anticipated as a fondue fan. I was floored however by their extensive dessert menu, where the flaming turtle using dark chocolate was the highlight of the meal. It will be in the potential date night rotation in the future."""
"2,""With some trepidation after reading other reviews from people who used coupons, we went for dinner to Ahwatukee Melting Pot. We have been there before and were always happy with meal but wondered how coupon would change it all based on other reviews.  This time two of us were on coupon and the third decided to get 4 course.  He says \""""what a great meal for $36!\""""   Jennifer was our very entertaining server. She was quick on the \""""merlot\"""" refill. Wink wink (she will know what we mean). Quick service and very fast on bringing generous refills of shrimp and tenderloin which we consumed the fastest.  All in all a great meal and loved the dessert!!  Jennifer earned her 20% gratuity."""
"1,""Our very presence in their lobby was an inconvenience to them. The manager was extremely rude when we asked for a table w out a reservation. No offer to wait just a blunt 45 min wait along with a snarky comment as we left \""""do not take any more people with out a reservation\"""". Thanks for the rude interaction were headed to Cheesecake Factory."""

"2,""Good food and good service. Indoor was a bit dark"""
"1,""Usually good but today was terrible. Ordered eggs basted soft. Got scrambled. Sent back and they came back cold, basted with oil and burnt around the edges. Toast was pretty much NOT toasted. Manager brought out more eggs as we were paying the bill. They adjusted the check though, so that was nice."""
"2,""Go for lunch. \n\nMy folks live here, I live at Arribas. This place is delcious. Two item lunch combo and a tall drink makes for a great day with family and friends. Take your parents here, take a date here food is always cooked excellently, always busy, friendly, and great. \n\nNever have had issues eating here. Sometimes take out would mess up which you just have to make sure when you go for pick up to double check, they are busy. \n\nAll and all the food is always good, I like the shredded beef tacos, the chicken chimichangas, Flautas, Dos XX or dare I say Margaritas in small punch bowels that will make you happy. \n\nIf you haven't tried swing by, if you have visit sometime."""
"1,""The service, chips and salsa were fine then it all went South.  I had the La Bandera (3 enchiladas) and all of them were tasteless and the meat was tough.  I went because I had a gift card.  As much as I love free meals I would gladly have paid double for good food."""
"2,""Had a great experience at this place. I went during lunch, had the chicken fajitas, and loved them. I definitely recommend this place at lunchtime, as it isn't too crowded and the prices are better. Also, our waitress was amazing! She waited on several tables and even heated up the tortillas. She also gave my family water to-go when she heard we were on a roadtrip. Loved it!"""

Here is my interview.\n\nInterview with my daughter.\n\nMe: What  do you like about Sweet Tomatoes?\n\nMira: The dessert and the pizza.\n\nMe: What else do you like?\n\nMira: The food.\n\nMe: But, why do you like coming HERE?\n\nMira: Because .  . . Of . . . the FOOD!\n\nMe: Is there anything else you like besides the food?\n\nMira: The drinks."""
"2,""Probably the best salad bar restaurant I have been to.  They have a great selection of items and everything is fresh. They have a few prepared salads if you are not in the mood to build or just want to use it as a starting point.  My favorite section though is the soup bar.  They always have a great selection to choose from, no matter your mood.  My favorites are the chili and of course the Sweet Tomato soup.  \nThe staff is usually friendly and not a nuisance like they can be at some buffets.  There is always someone circling the floor with a basket of cookies.  Definitely a favorite of ours when we lived in Phoenix.  I wish they were in PA and MD so we could visit again.\nIf you are looking for a quick healthy meal (with the not so healthy always available) look no farther."""
"2,""GOOD SALAD BAR\nConsistently, good food. The soup, salad and  desserts are good.\nGREAT value for families with small children under 2 eat free. Ice Cream Machine with the toppings and really good home made biscuits and honey butter."""
"1,""Taken my daughter to this office a few times, but won't anymore. The good points- the office is clean. The staff that answers the phone is nice and usually helpful.  The hygienists are all really nice and are kid friendly.  On the downside- when you walk into this place it just feels cold.  The staff won't even greet you since you have to sign in at a computer.  Dr. Ash wasn't as kid-friendly and a little bullish with my daughter.  I understand she was crying, but she didn't do anything to make her feel more comfortable.  They seem to be all about money"
"2,""the bomb! and cheap!"""
"2,""Tried them again with the kids last night and have a few new things to say since my last visit.\n\nI had Bombero sauce put onto a carne asada Chimi this time, and it was FABULOUS.  Works better on a chimi than a burrito, I think, because the sauce makes the burrito tortilla \""""wet\"""" and does not have the same soggy effect on the fried shell of the chimi.\n\nThe carne asada last night was smokey and awesome.  It has not been this good on my prior visits.  It was pure, smokey goodness this trip.\n\nThe chicken hard-shell tacos held together better too....after falling apart last trip.  I wonder if they changed their shell a little?  Anyway, they were delicious.\n\nA word about the \""""salad\"""" too - it is that micro-shredded lettuce and a few tomatoes and a little white Mexican cheese sprinkled on top.  And it was all perfectly fresh and delicious.\n\nThe beans again were better than your average refried beans - something about them I can't place for sure, but they are delish.\n\nThe staff was great and friendly.  I'm gonna spend more time eating here.  It's pretty darn outstanding...."""
"2,""Had the super nachos and hard shell taco. Nachos were loaded- had extra toppings when we ran out of chips and the tacos were nice with a little heat."""
"2,""Wow what a hidden gem this place is!!! Stopped in with my mom and sister. I ordered a bean tostada, pastor street taco and some chips and salsa. Everything tasted fresh and amazing. Beans were creamy, salsa was a fresh pico de gallo, chips were crispy, and the pastor was succulent and a little hint of spice. My mom ordered the steak fajitas and they were well worth the wait. The meat was tender and flavorful and the onions and peppers were caramelized and perfectly seasoned. The rice had such a great texture and hint of flavor that I loved. My sister had a veggie street taco which I had a bite of and it was surprisingly good. It was beans, peppers, onions, potatoes and avocado. The only negative was the ladies bathroom was in disrepair and a little dirty. However the food and quick service was outstanding. I will definitely be back."""
"1,""Would not recommend.  Food was good but I feel the refried beans were cooked from a pot of boiled beans that had burnt.  I like *ahumado* flavor but geez.  Bummer the tacos seemed good but i could not get over the flavor of the beans. Disappointed they would serve that"""
"1,""Food is decent but service makes this place a risk.  They often lose orders or screw up the orders.  So, calling ahead to save time often turns into waiting for them to fix or create the order you gave them 20 minutes prior. You'd think a neighborhood restaurant would care enough to get an order right.  Quality also varies greatly for order to order. Try Burrito Company instead."""
"1,""Overpriced and uneven haircuts given. Don't waste your money here! It costs more to get a tiny dog groomed than a regular woman's haircut. $55 for a 3 pound dog !! They are crazy..."""
"1,""From a veg point of view this place was a total flop. The online menu shows a fish sandwich, however in store the menu item was missing.\n\nUnlike you usually Greek esque place, there is no falafel. I resorted to hummus $2.95 and for that price it does not include any pita, so I was forced to order a peta for $.90\n\nThe hummus came in a small Styrofoam cup not worth the $3 and the pita was soft and warm but again worth nearly a $1 I think not.\n\nMost of the menu is beef gyros, gyro meat plats or gyro sandwiches.\n\nThere are a few salads on the menu but I am not a salad person.\n\nI think I miss the pizza hut that used to occupy this location"""

"1,""Terrible haircut. She took only about 10 minutes to cut my hair and it looked uneven. I then told her and she said that's just the way my hair was. Now I have to go back to get it fixed. I would never pay any amount to get my hair cut there again."""

I would much rather eat at Va Bene which is probably a 10 min drive from this restaurant. The quality of food is a lot better and fresher.  Also the waiter here wasn't too competent and service is incredibly slow for a non-busy night."""
"1,""The waiter was nice and very friendly tonight. The bread and salad was good. But the linguini and clams was kinda gross. It was nothing new. The sauce tasted plain and the clams were already on the noodles. It's more spontaneous when you can open the clams yourself. The sauce was also really thick. If it was thinner it would have been better. The cheesecake was alright. I've had better and the portion is really small. I looked at it and said are you kidding me?

He called me the week of our wedding to discuss all playlists, ceremony music and timing, and the nature of what we were looking for at our reception.  The wireless mic we ordered was flawless, and the sound quality and lighting provided were perfect for our venue and guests.

"1,""This place is NOT a 4 star hotel as they try to state they are.  We paid $300 a night expecting to have a nice experience at what is supposed to be a guest only water park. The park was just like any other public water park. There was absolutely no place to sit and the chairs if you could find one were cheap with cheap towels.  We never even made it to our room as we checked out as soon as we experienced the pool.  BTW we found out that they constantly run special pricing cutting room rates to about 100 a night.  This is why the water park is packed and for those of us that expect to receive  4star $300 a night hotel service will be out of luck at this hotel. Might be worth it if you get one of their cheap deals."""
"1,""I am actually writing this review from my room at the hotel now.\n\nVery disapointed in this place.  My wife and I have been here for a week and even with the deal I got on our room I feel like I've overpaid.  In fact the only good thing about this place so far is that it was cheap.\n\n- Rooms are old and dirty.  I was told that some of the rooms have been renovated and are nice but not the room that we were given thats for sure.  Stains all over the carpets, bird droppings all over the balcony and balcony furniture.  Pretty gross.  Not to mention both the TVs were small, old and unwatchable which was actually a problem seeing how none of the pools were worth going to but more on those later.\n\n- Maid service was horrible and non-existant.  We have been for 5 days and have maid service only three times.  On the second time we happened to come back to our room while the maid was still there, she locked herself in our room and had both TVs on a spanish soap opera and was visibly annoyed that we wanted in to our room.  She didn't even \""""clean\"""" the room and simply changed out the towels and made the bed.  Bags for ice (the ice bucket was too dirty to use without one) were never replenished, garbage on top of the mini-bar was never removed and room service trays were not being picked up.  Our breakfast trays sit outside in the hot Arizona sun until the next morning when our new breakfast is delivered.  The plus side of this is that we had an entertaining bird fight outside our room last night.\n\n- Pools.  So they charge a 30$/day resort fee.  The theory here is that the 30/day gives us full access to the water park, pools, gym etc. which is a great idea although the water park is closed during the week, the gym is ok but the other pools... DISGUSTING.  More bird droppings everywhere and garbage in the water.  There is a pool that advertises a swim up bar.. sure there is something that looks like a bar.. but no alcohol or even an attendant to serve you.  Some of the pools have a phone you can use to order from a limited menu but they can't even get basic orders right.\n\n- Room Service.  Very limited menu and as with most places overpriced.  This plus they seem to not understand basic instructions like \""""do not toast my sandwhich please\"""".  My wife -- after THREE times asking for it to be made right finally gave up and just ate it as it was.\n\nThis place does have potential but apparently they are understaffed and those that do work here do not seem to care and it really needs updating and cleaning.\n\nWould not stay here again."""
"1,""Sprawling tired resort with $30 a day resort fee and lots of tipping opportunities. The resort fee was supposed to be waived for those attending the event, and was with restrictions like we couldn't use the fitness center. Only stayed here because the conference was here. We told the front desk that we were there for the conference, and wanted to be with the other Realtors, and instead they put us in a Mountainside Villa that was a hike to get to the event."""
"1,""NOTE: Our stay could have been an entirely different experience had we not booked a stay the weekend after a Livingsocial.com deal was made available.  We did not buy that deal, we were regular customers...\n\nOk, starting at the beginning.  \n\n- Check-in is 4:00pm.  We got there at 3:50pm, arrived to a line of no less than 30 people.  NO rooms were available for us.  They temporarily checked us in and said we could go to the water park and call back in an hour to see if a room was ready... but, the only place to change was at the Athletic Club clear on the opposite side of the park.  By the time we hiked over there and back it was 5pm.  Our room wasn't ready until 6:40 (we called about 5 times until they finally had one ready.)  \n\n- The room was HOT.  It was on the top floor and really never cooled down, even after we removed a gross, dirty air filter (I'll be posting a picture in case you're into looking at icky stuff.)  If you're one of those people who likes it very quiet to sleep, top floor is bad.\n\n- Also, on the noise topic, our bathtub dripped so bad it sounded like the faucet was on a slow trickle the whole time.  Water wasters!  Side note, the bathroom was so small you had to step out of the way to shut the door.  A large person might need to step into the tub to shut the door. :(\n\n- Gross... there were several places of STICKY on the carpeting.  2 were right in places where normal people put their feet all the time so that was annoying and nobody should have been in that room until that was cleaned (but they were completely sold out because of the LivingSocial.com deal.)\n\n- The railings along the walkways to our room seem 'flimsy' to an acrophobe like me.  If you have small children, or rowdy older kids, you might ask for a room on a different floor.  A lower floor, closer to the ground... safer.\n\n- The Oasis water park was ok, but the staff had no continuity.  One person would allow a 47\"""" child to ride the slide, another wouldn't.  One day they didn't care if your floats were by your seats while you ate lunch, the next day they were collecting them just for getting out of the water.  And so on and so forth...  And any time you get a bunch of people staying at a resort they wouldn't normally be able to afford, you're going to get a class of people that are... sub-par.  We saw at least 2 instances of people just taking other peoples chaises, even when they clearly had their personal stuff (shoes, shirts) stored there.  There was considerable pushing and shoving to get in the water, lots of unsupervised, rude 8-12 year old kids.  All of this was a nuisance that probably is not a regular issue.\n\n\n\nTHE HOTEL DID TRY TO MAKE RIGHT BY US.  We only complained about having to wait for a room for so long and they ended up cutting our hotel rate in half (which was then less than those LivingSocial.com folks) and giving us vouchers for drinks (6) and enough vouchers to cover our lunch (for 6 people.)  So they were aware of how screwed up things were.  We didn't complain about the room or the park as it was so incredibly busy it didn't seem worth it."""
"2,""Pretty awesome place. Great pools and kid friendly."""
"2,""My daughter's high school basketball team comes to the Arizona Grand Resort twice every year for the Nike Tournament of Champions.  It is a beautiful place, centrally located, with lots of amenities at the resort and nearby. This year we had a problem with the wi-fi access in the Mountainside rooms, but the manager made it right by us.  Our team enjoyed themselves, and it is a good value, so we'll keep coming back to this resort."""
"1,""This resort is in need of serious renovations! The king bed sagged in the middle and was very uncomfortable. The pullout sofa literally had springs popping through the thin mattress. The pools were well over 100* and not refreshing at all. The last night we were there the fire alarm went off at 12:30am for over a half hour with loud pitch sirens to find out someone had pulled the alarm. Nothing about this resort was worth the money. The kids were quickly bored of the slides and all complained it pinched their skin and hurt their butts like a bruised feeling. We will not be back... Ever."""
"1,""We stayed here for 5 days to visit with our granddaughters from Bay Area CA.  Upon arriving we soon realized that our room had no internet.  I was on the phone with the front desk along with the internet provider for over an hour to no avail.  The next morning they had us move to room C235 (which was a complete inconvenience since we had already unpacked everything!!!).  This room, while directly next to the pool, still had very spotty WIFI and I was constantly getting booted from the internet both on my iphone and my ipad.\n\nWhile the pool was nice and the grandchildren enjoyed the Oasis Water Park ($40 per wrist band for extra guests) there was no microwave in the hotel room and the mini fridge (if you can call it that) was so small that nothing fit, and the few things we did put in it (which were leftovers from the Rustlers Roost) along with our beverages were warm in the morning!!!  \n\nBottom line......this place might offer you a deal on the room rate, but be very prepared to spend a crapload of money at the \""""Lobby Bar & Grill\"""", \""""Rustlers Roost\"""" or \""""Aunt Chiladas\""""!!!  They make sure you can't store or prepare food in your room.  I've stayed at some pretty shady motels in my life and they have ALL had a mini fridge with a mini freezer and for the most part a microwave!!!  We were very disappointed in this hotel and will NEVER EVER AGAIN STAY HERE!!\n\nOh and don't forget the $40/day resort fee on top of your room rate.....then ad $5/day tax to that!! Really??\n\nOh and if you order a movie for the kids it's only good for ONE WATCH, not 24 hours like everywhere else.  Seriously this place is a RIPOFF!!  Do yourself and your family a financial favor and stay in Mesa, then get tickets to Sunsplash for $20/day and put the rest of your money in your back pocket or grab a pizza at 1/4 the cost of that money grabber AZ Grand Resort!  I know I will next time.\n\nTobin"""
"2,""We recently stayed at the resort for a large dance competition.  the hotel was terrific"
"2,""I arrived with my three year old asleep in her car seat.  She was probably out for the night.  I promptly woke her up and after passing a rather large bull we entered the cave.  A few more turns and we entered the restaurant on the second floor.  At this point, we were given the choice of slide or stairs down to the dining area.  I parted ways with my daughter at this point.  I didn't need The DVD player to entertain her this meal, the slide entertained her till the food arrived.  She came back briefly in tears with an incoherent story about some collision, and then went back to sliding.  With some older kids present, letting a three year old free to slide was a little dubious, but sipping my water in silence left me unconcerned.  I ordered a kids meal, grilled cheese, for her and I had meat.  My daughter ate her meal with a napkin and paper bull horns.  For my part, meat is good.  Clearly a tourist stop, as reflected in the price and by the d\u00e9cor, I've been waiting for some non-vegetarian relative to visit so that I can return."""

Hubby had the swordfish and was over the moon about it (it was his first time having it)\nMy only complaint was that the music was REALLY loud for a restaurant but hey, we were entertained. \nWe had a great evening and look forward to returning next time we are craving steak!"""
"2,""Went here for a rehearsal dinner for a wedding. The food was great, the service was great, the drinks were great. \n\nWe ate outside and the view was spectacular. \n\nI'm a little bummed I missed out on the infamous slide, but next time for sure. \n\nMy biggest issue was parking. Even on a Thursday night we had drive around for quite a while to find a spot. It was tough because our car contained a toddler, and a 7 months pregnant woman and we has to hoof it pretty far. Maybe a shuttle service from lower level parking would help."""

"1,""Worst service EVER for large parties. We had a party of 12 in celebration of my father in law's 50th birthday. We ordered our food and it took over a hour and a half for it to come out!!! I'm sorry but that's just terrible. Every time we asked the waiter about our food he said \""""Oh, it will be out in a few minutes\"""". We watched every table around us eat their food and leave before we even got our food. These parties were anywhere from 6-10 people so I don't understand why it took so long for 12 people. \n\nThe food itself was nothing impressive either. The best part about the dinner was probably the Indian fry bread. Everything else was edible.\n\nWe will definitely never be eating here again."""
"1,""I ordered the Big Burger and was sorely disappointed. The burger patty was over cooked, soaked in grease, and tasteless. The fries were nothing special nor were the onion rings. The atmosphere was loud as to be expected, the waitstaff was pleasent enough"

"1,""Well, food was bad. My shrimp was TASTELESS....I mean....no seasoning AT ALL. Bland rice. Others at the table said the same thing about their food. Amazing waiter though. For a crazy Friday night with kids everywhere...he was amazing and attentive. Wish I remembered his name. Very tall guy. LOL. This place is geared more for children for sure. A big slide, a balloon guy comes to the tables ect. An adorable bull is near the entrance and the view is awesome. But I would say this place is more for kids than an adult night. That's just my opinion."""

"1,""HORRIBLE DRY CLEANER. DO NOT USE. \n\nDropped off around 20 items for dry cleaning, and at least 4 came back totally ruined. Buttons were broken, ink stains were on several items (like from a ballpoint pen) that had not been present when I dropped off the clothing. \n\nStains I had mentioned and asked them to try to remove were still present, and they didn't make any notice of this or let me know that they were unable to remove said stains. Several stains looked untouched, like they hadn't even made an attempt to remove them. A few silk items I dropped off came back feeling like a strange texture, like they were very stiff. When I complained, no explanation was offered and the best they could do was take the items with ink for a free redo. They were practically already ruined, so I let them try. Around 300 dollars of clothing was ruined by this dry cleaner. Awful, awful service."""
"2,""I've never had a bad experience with this location! Of course it's not the best pizza in the world, but it deserves to be measured against its own potential.\n\nThe online ordering process is really painless--don't bother calling. I was hesitant to do it at first, but they really have their system down. You can even watch a little progress meter that tells you when they are making your order, when they are checking it, and when they leave the store with it if you requested delivery. There are always coupons available online as well.\n\nThe orders we've placed have always been correct. We don't just order pizza--at times we've ordered wings, sandwiches, soda, and even specialty items like gluten-free crust pizza. They nail it every time."""
"2,""It seems the staff here have made a huge improvements recently.  They smile and are polite. Perhaps they let some of the staff go. If so, that was wise.

"2,""I am really impressed by this facility. Every machine you could want, Racquetball courts, The best spin bikes anywhere, large arobics room, free weights, TV's on the cardio some with ipod hookups, pool, spa and a steam room.\n\nSure the staff may be incompetent, and the sales people are probably very shady, but luckily I was grandfathered in from PureFiness and rarely deal with either. \n\nOne of the biggest negatives for me is the parking lot. There are more speed bumps in the parking lot  per 100 feet than you will see in your whole day. I do not know why they felt it necessary to put so many of them. I can not drive my convertible here due to them.\n\nI also am unsure about the aroma of the free weight area in back, To me it smells like a barn, but I think it is due to the glue used on the floor. Either way I do hope it dissipates soon.\n\nThe machines are nice they usually have two to three of each type of machine with the latest being the eclipse line that are very smooth and easily adjustable.\n\nThe spin bikes are great, very smooth, digital read outs and so far 100% functional.\n\nA small grip with the TV's on the cardio equipment is the channel selection. News stations sports, E and some anti acne channel. I would be happier with the local mix of channels.\n\nThe pool area is nice with a three lane lap pool, sizable spa, and steam room.

"1,""Quite the adventure.  I had bought a Living Social and Gavin did my hair.  It came out fine (cut, color, and blow out) and since then I have been back three times.  The last time I went, I had an appointment and when I walked in, Gavin was working on someone else.  I waited twenty five minutes before it was my time to get my hair cut and colored.  Not even a sorry I am running late.  Two weeks ago I booked with Gavin for 9:00.  The day before my appointment I got a voicemail asking if I could come at 11:30.  When I called back I said I would change my appointment for then.  I was then asked if I could make it at 12:00.  I said yes.  Got there today and Gavin was NOT there.  First I was told he was out getting supplies, and then after 15 minutes I told Frank, the owner, that I was not going to wait anymore and leave.  He then told me that Gavin was on his way and had gone for therapy.  So which is it?  Supply store or therapy.  In any case, as I was walking out, Gavin showed up 20 minutes late.  I usually don't write bad reviews but I just wanted to warn others as this has got to be the most exasperated I have ever been at a hairdresser."""

Quality is hit or miss and the hits are as bad as they get! While it's true you may get a decent stylist, the bad ones are so bad they should have their licenses revoked. I got a haircut there once. It was so uneven that people I didn't even know were commenting on it. When I mentioned it to the manager, she said that the girl was new and still \""""working out the kinks\"""" - there was no offer of reparation or a coupon for the next visit. \n2. Turnover and unhappy staff: it's impossible to find a good stylist that will stick around very long. I've witnessed full force arguments between members of the staff that were loud enough for everyone in the store to hear. \n3. No customer service: if you complain about anything to the staff or manager, you may get an apology but forget about anything else in the way of amends.\n\nWhile I realize that you can't expect miracles from a low end salon that only charges $15 per haircut (no blow dry for that amount) it's still reasonable to expect competent professionals, right?"""
"1,""DO NOT GO!  I took my Pomeranian there to be groomed.  They were given very SPECIFIC instruction's on how I wanted her groomed, including length of the body, and to just trim the face, leaving her with some fluff and fullness around the face as a Pom should be.  When I picked her up, the groomer had completely shaved her entire body, including around her face.  When I asked why she looked this way the answer the groomer gave me was \""""I groom pom's like fox's.\""""  This was a blatant disregard for what I (the customer) had specifically asked for.  When I spoke to the manager and told her I was completely unsatisfied with how she looked and that my instructions were completely disregarded her answer was \""""do you want me to fix it?\""""  Fix it?!  What is there to fix?  There is no hair left!  So I said \""""no I don't want you to cut anymore off\"""" (she would look completely bald).  Then she said \""""well what do you want me to do?\""""  I said \""""well I'm an unsatisfied customer, what do you do when that happens?\""""  She said she would give me a discount on my next grooming.  I said \""""I paid for this grooming, which was atrocious, not my dogs next grooming.\""""  Then she says \""""well it sounds like you just want to complain and not let me fix it.\""""  I said \""""what is there to fix?  Again, she has NO hair left!\""""  So then she says \""""well do you want a refund?  Would that make you happy?\""""  I said yes that would make me very happy.  Her reply \""""well I just can't do that.\""""  Ok, so then why was that offered to me?

That is so true.\n\nWhen you first walk in and are looking at the bagels, the baked goods, the menu, the purple lights, you almost forget about your last, horrible experience. Have no fear, once the food is served, you quickly remember. I ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich - no ham, and a medium coffee. Seems simple enough. They brought me the sandwich WITH ham. I didn't know when I first bit into it. This ham is still alive, it is so tough, I am sure this is what Wilson rejects for their footballs. What is wrong with you Paradise? Why would you stick a huge slab of tough ham inside a croissant. A croissant that wasn't even toasted. Which brings me to my next comment. You stick an egg on a croissant and you make no attempt to toast the croissant? Even Dunkin Donuts toasts the croissant. You have no clue how to make anything. Even after Panera acquired you, they couldn't impart any wisdom into you? And coming from Panera, that would be little wisdom since they have a terrible menu, which you made worse.\n\nIt was good to taste the same bitter mud, er, coffee, that Panera serves.\n\nParadise, you owe me more money for this disgusting crap you served me, but why can't you try to improve? You clearly can't think this food is good? You remind me of the fat girl in school who boys would tell her, she had a cute face just to get some action out of her.

Hmmmm\nAnyway she said on more than 3 accounts how she loved the cheese fries and onion rings we were sharing. Maybe she wanted some? Well the orders were bigger than the 3 of us could consume and we trashed the remaining. LOL\n\nI thought the Onion rings were grand, but was not impressed with the cheese fries. At half price they are a good deal for either but at full price I would rethink before spending 7 bucks on fries."""
"2,""We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table on a Friday night after 7pm.  It would have been a 30 minute wait for an outside table which would have been preferable to us.\n\nWent with my son and husband.  I ordered a Mangorita and enjoyed it.  My husbands Pina Colada was also very tasty.\n\nHusband got pork tacos and was happy with them.  Son got a teriyaki burger and loved it.  I had a Hula veggie burger and it was good but I was wishing I had ordered the Teriyaki one also.  I ordered the french fries with cheese and scallions on them.  At first they tasted good but then they started to taste fishy.  (The likely fry them in the same oil?)\n\nGreat place to bring the kids.  Service is good and the ambiance is fun.  The kids meals are a great size.  My two littlest ones could easily share one meal if we bring them next time."""
"1,""Meh... the only reason I even stepped foot into Rock Bottom is because I had a lunch meeting and it was at the suggestion of my dining companion. I used to go to Rock Bottom in Atlanta every now and then and it was ok... especially if you go for beer / happy hour.  I going to be blunt here right now though:  this place sucks!\n\nLuckily, I enjoyed the company of those that I dined with, otherwise, it would've been a miserable experience!  Thanks for that, Miranda and Ken (if you happen to read this!)  \n\nI had their cobb salad and it was pretty average although the turkey in it was nasty.  Our waitress was slow as hell.  The atmosphere (keep in mind we were there for lunch) was nothing special.  Rock Bottom is the reason that I'm not big on chains.  I don't think I'll be returning.  Even if I'm stuck at Desert Ridge, there are plenty of other dining options that are far superior to Rock Bottom (CPK, Yardhouse, Rubios, and more).\n\nSorry, RB - had to do it..."""
"1,""Food is mediochre at best. Service is slow even by geologic time. The micro brew is typical and unimaginitive. On the good side the patio is dog friendly. One star just for that."""
"1,""The food is a tad better than okay. The service is somewhat mixed, it depends who you get for the evening. Some are more motivated than others. The manager, Summer :-), is awesome. Ask her if you need anything or have tips for her to inspire you to come again. If I do a food business, I will\n\nWe love the free wifi. A must for any locale these days. The bear is GREAT. Love the micro brews. \n\nA note in general: somebody get a grip on the fish prices in Arizona please. The only healthy omega3 and protein source we all need, instead, yes yummy but unhealthy quesadillas are cheap. Something's wrong here. Most locations throughout the valley still don't take enough advantage of the promotional built in coupons Yelp has to offer to attract new and keep old customers.\n\nThe five different music styles running non stop in the desert ridge outside area mixed with every store's individual out put is nerve wrecking.\n\nA few big plants and bushes along the iron fence would create a more natural and soothing setting. Atmosphere is half the rent."""
"1,""I've been to this location a few times but last night was the WORST service I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. We got here a little before reverse happy hour so we waited to order food and drinks until 9pm. Our waitress barely came to our table to check on us and the place was pretty dead. We ordered our food at 9:10, got our pot stickers appetizer at 9:45pm. I ordered a sangria and it took about 20 minutes for it to come out. Our friends couldn't get a refill on water and iced tea to save their life...the list goes on and on here. All of our entrees were cold and tasted like they had been re-heated and sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Really not appetizing and we all left hungry. When we asked to speak to the manager, she offered us a \""""free\"""" dessert and after 30 minutes of waiting, we walked over to the hostess stand and waited to speak to her again. At this point, we didn't even want the dessert or anything to do with the place. Oh, and on top of everything, the place was FREEZING!! Yes that sounds great in the summer but it was unbearably cold. Overall, this is a very poorly run restaurant with very poor service. We were comped the food and offered a couple coupons but I am certain I will never come back here!!"""
"2,""This is always a great place to take my son when it's time to cool down...he loves to play at the train table in the children's area.  Afterwards, he picks 2 books, we read them and go home.  I'm surprised this place stays in business considering people just read there and then leave - but until it does, we will keep coming to do the same.  This place was definitely better than Border's when it was still around."""
"1,""I've never had a great experience at Macaroni Grill but decided to try it again since I heard their menu had changed.  The menu may have changed but that's all that's changed.  We sat for a good 10-15 minutes before the manager came over to take our drink order, saying our waitress was bogged down with other tables.  I looked around and the bartenders were waiting on other tables.  It looked like there were only 2 waitresses in the entire restaurant.\nI ordered fettucine alfredo and was disappointed immediately when it arrived because they had ground up pepper sprinkled all over the top of it.  Why would any restaurant put pepper all over someone's food??  Well, apparently they did it to disguise the fact that their alfredo sauce has absolutely no flavor.  None at all.  I have had alfredo pasta at fast food Italian places and it's been better than this.  My husband ordered the chicken milanese and it was covered in some sweet sauce that did nothing for the chicken.  The best part of the entire meal was the potatoes that were served with my husband's chicken.  They were really good.  \nOverall, it was a complete waste of an hour of my life and $45.  I will never go back again.\nOh, and P.S.  Who serves water in gross bottles with NO ICE??  Yuck!"""
"1,""We've moved away from chain restaurants due to the lack of service we typically receive.  I almost felt judged by the server because we weren't dressed up.  I mean, we were in jeans and t-shirts, but didn't look like bums.  The food was terrible too.  The server seemed annoyed that he had to bring us extra calamari sauce and was difficult to find.  They claim their pasta is homemade and \""""al dente\"""", but really it was just undercooked.  I've had fresh pasta before and never had it served so hard, or sticking together.  I doubt we'll ever come back."""
"2,""I don't know what it is we East Coast-ers did, exactly, but it must have been pretty bad for us to miss out on a burger joint like In-N-Out!\n\nI blew into Scottsdale with my mother recently, and she insisted that the first thing in my mouth absolutely HAD to be an In-N-Out burger.\n\nShe wasn't wrong.\n\nI'm a little sad, thinking that I'll have to say goodbye to such fresh, glorious burgers when I head back to Atlanta for school.\n\nThe Big Mac WISHES it could be a Double Double. \n\nThe fries aren't that great--then again, I haven't tried Animal Style yet--but the burgers are more than meat enough for me. "
"1,""The food is good, but the service isn't. Weekend mornings are a nightmare here, also they frequently run out of things."""
"1,""You know, I feel kind of bad for giving this place a two star review, because I really liked our server, but as far as food goes, I can't be that generous.  They do have a great breakfast deal for super cheap, but I went the route of a half waffle with bacon, and it probably came with eggs, but I'm not so sure.  The bacon was really gross.  There's this specific type of bacon that really makes me nauseous, and Sonic has it too, but it just has a sour taste to it that makes my tummy do flip flops.  I took one bite and then left it alone after that.  The waffle looked really promising, but unfortunately it tasted like it was made from the pancake batter so it was really dense and soft, not light and crisp like Belgian Waffles should be.  What a disappointment.  I was ready to love this place and all it's kitschy decorations, but the food was just not nearly good enough."""
"2,""Oh, how I miss this place!  This was our favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  They give you huge portions for really cheap. They aren't jerks about substitutions or special orders.  Just lots of normal greasy food.  They serve breakfast all day.  If you just order a salad, the salads are bigger than your head and they give you a whole bowl full of dressing.  I had the chef salad all the time.\n\nSome of the waitresses are a little kooky, but you soon figure out which servers to ask for.  Jeremy was a great waiter if he's still there.  He'd see us coming in and grab a high chair and find us a table before the hostess even saw us.  Jeremy seems to make it a point to go the extra mile for his regulars. He remembers what they always drink, what they usually like to order, their special requests, their kids names.  That guy earns his tips.  He is on the ball.  The little old lady with the thick accent is slow but she's a nice little old lady.  One of the waitresses with dyed hair is a bit too chatty and we avoided sitting in her section whenever possible.  She's definitely weird but totally harmless I promise!  \n\nIf you're all high class don't bother with this place, you won't like it.  If you want normal food for cheap and you want to be full when you leave, this is the place to go.  We would generally try to go when they weren't crazy busy though because the wait can be long sometimes.  Like when the after church crowd gets there.\n\nThe decor is loud and smart alecky.  The food is normal diner food.  It is the kind of place that has a lot of \""""regulars\"""" that go there all the time including a lot of older folks.  And if you become regulars like we did, they get to know you and you get to know them and the place really grows on you."""
"2,""Yum, yum, yummy.  You'll want to check these folks out!  They have been on Groupon a few times and you get lots of food for the money.  Really, if there were such a thing as a 'to go' bag for breakfast, you'll need it.  Great tasting skillets, wonderful hamburgers and a genuinely friendly, helpful staff. They made us feel at home and that's every time (have been there three times) we've gone.  They don't get upset about Groupon and stop to chat if you're willing.  This place reminds me of what diners used to be.  Try it!"""
"1,""Never in a gazillion years would I expect to take people to a Roy's and have a bad food experience - pigs are flying. \nI took some employees and their spouses out for a year end thank-you dinner. While the lobster potstickers and spicy tuna appetizers were great, that's where the good part of the meal ended. My butterfish, usually mouth watering yumminess was so-so and served with white rice. Other dishes at the table like the swordfish and petite filet were dry and flavorless.\nI'd prefer not to delve more into the embarassment that was this dining experience....needless to say I have since eaten at the Chandler Roy's and had my faith restored - but I pressed my luck at the JW location and pulled up a big Whammy."""
"2,""I have never been disappointed when I eat at Roy's. The menu has pretty much been the same for years, as it should be, because it's perfect. If you have food allergies, they are probably the most accommodating of any place I've ever been to, which makes it all the more worth it. They have a huge drink menu as well, but the 1988 Martini is fantastic. Sit out on the patio if the weather's nice, it's very relaxing. \nThe appetizer canoe is the best way to start the meal: the Szechwan ribs, lobster pot stickers (from what I remember before I found out that I'm gluten intolerant) and the seared ahi are all awesome. From the entrees I've had over the years, I can say that they are all delightful. The sauces are what really make the dishes stand out, which is probably why Roy's is known for having really great sauces that compliment the dishes well. The molten hot chocolate souffle is to die for though. My family goes to Roy's only once a year for my parents' anniversary, and that souffle is what I look forward to all year. I just had it on Friday, and I already want another one. \nThe service is great too. Our waiter was very attentive to us and we had a great time."""
"2,""My original opinion was that Roy's was one of those obscenely expensive, tourist trap-like hotel restaurants that suckered in hotel guests who were either too lazy or too drunk to venture off the property. Wrong again. \n\nI went here with some business colleagues and enjoyed an excellent experience. Had the seared tuna (and I'm not a fish-in-a-restaurant guy) and it was very flavorful and accompanied by a wasabi sauce I wanted to take a bath in. Service was excellent, although we were a table of 10 with an expense account. Perhaps they smelled blood, or at least this week's grocery money. \n\nMy favorite part of the night, and I'm sure it's standard fare at high end places, was that they brought out a selection of reading glasses when I needed to read the small print of the menu. Call me rube if you'd like."""
"1,""We came here on a Saturday night for a birthday celebration with 3 other couples and spent over $700.  Service was great but the food was terrible.  appetizers were small and overpriced.  We had the calamari, loco moco,  canoe and ribs.   the only appetizer everyone raved about were the ribs but the rest were horrible.  We ordered several entrees including short ribs, butterfish, salmon, pork shank and curried chicken.  Other than the fish entrees, there were alot of leftover foods and no one wanted to take home any because no one wanted to eat any of the food twice.  We skipped desserts, no one wanted to try any.  Drinks were great and again, service was great.   Not a good nor memorable experience at Roy's for us unfortunately."""
"1,""Great atmosphere, but food not up to par. \nMy wife had the Mahi Mahi.  Overdone, dry.  \nMy filet was .... Well, ehhh, okay, I guess.  \nThe wasabi mashed potatoes were .... Well, okay, I guess, not much texture or taste.  \nTwo stars is being generous."""
"2,""I have been to several other Roy's locations and they have always been absolutely fabulous. Everything from the service, to the attentiveness of the staff, to the delicious food, and gorgeous ambience inside the restaurant. Every staff member you pass greets you- at my home location in Los Angeles (where I celebrated my birthday) every staff member I passed even wished me a happy birthday! Mindblowing stuff. The lobster gyoza are wonderful and I am a huge fan of Roy's Trio, with the misoyaki butterfish, macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, and teriyaki salmon! The flavors make the food just melt in your mouth. My boyfriend got one of the Chef's creations with Hawaiian ono that he said was amazing as well. We celebrated his birthday and the staff took the obligatory picture and brought out a complimentary and truly delicious dessert for him. It was all lovely and my boyfriend had a fantastic birthday dinner.\n\nMy only complaint, and the reason I don't give this location five stars, is that the restaurant was large and not that busy. There were tons of open tables in every room. Despite this, we were seated at a table that was literally situated a foot from an open booth nearby (that had a family with young children in it). My chair was the one closest to the booth and I felt not only that I was being intruded upon, but that I was intruding on THEM since my left arm was practically resting on their booth table! The staff couldn't have seated them ANYWHERE else? We were seated before the family was and there was no reason to have us camped next to each other cheek and jowl. It did detract from my overall dining experience, and this place is pricey already to begin with. If I'm going to enjoy a nice $35 entree with my $15 cocktail, I would like to not have a family of four shouting into my left ear."""
"1,""From the hostesses to the waitress, everything was just wrong. This was my first time in this location, and it will be my last. They need lots of training in customer service and guest satisfaction. They think they got it, but leaving someone standing at the entry without acknowledging, and sitting them next to dirty tables, and waitressses that look at you all weird and managers that respond like if they are so important that they cannot have \""""bread\"""" because they are too \""""elegant\"""" is not really nice service.... It is not!"""
"2,""Just tried this pita place for lunch as they had mailed my office some coupons and I was pleasantly surprised! They had way more toppings than I expected (bean mix, broccoli salad, tabbouleh, 3 different kinds of hummus and tons of fresh veggies). I also really liked their tuna option, as it's not mixed with mayonnaise, allowing you to create your own 'tuna salad' wrap by choosing from their hummus options or other sauces.\n\n It's really convenient that they list the calories for the pitas and for $6, the 'regular' size was a perfect portion! I'm definitely coming back to try their falafel and veggie pita, too."""
"1,""I have taken my Shitzu Joey there for a long time to get a shampoo and cute, and have not been happy. I was too lazy to go anywhere else. Well now, I'm done with Petco.

Goodbye Petco for good!"""
"1,""After a morning of shopping in busy Scottsdale we decided to stop at Elephant Bar on Mayo to get out of the craziness that can be Scottsdale Road area.  We had been to this location before and remember it as being ok for drinks and appetizers so off we went.\n\nWe were greeted immediately by a friendly fellow and shown to a table in the bar. When I asked why we couldn't sit in the restaurant the waiter said we could and no problem.  Maybe we look like big drinkers and he thought we'd want to be seated close to the liquor.  LOL.\n\nMy husband ordered a Ahi Tuna Salad and said the tuna was really fishy but the greens were fine.  Instead of a regular entr\u00e9e I opted to order off the appetizer menu and got the chicken lettuce wraps.  PF Chang's has nothing to worry about.  Theirs are far superior to the ones I just had at EB.  Very boring.  We shared another appetizer, the crispy green beans. I don't think they got their grease hot enough because these were incredibly greasy and smelled of old grease.  The chipotle sauce served with them was ok and the only thing that made the greasy green beans even a little bit edible.  \n\nIf I would have noticed how horribly stained the booth was that they seated us in I probably would have insisted on leaving.  Unfortunately I did not see how dirty it was until my husband stood up to go to the restroom.\n\nI will pass on Elephant Bar the next time I am in the mood for Ahi Tuna, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, crispy green beans or a clean booth to sit in!"""
"2,""Maybe it's because I first tried this place on a day I got some GREAT news, but I REALLY like Tea Light.  I've experienced the greatness that is Tea Light twice now and I can honestly say this place hits the spot in my world.  I am so happy to now have a go-to place for excellent take out, which is not your ordinary meal.\n\nSo far I've tried the beef pho, the chicken sandwich, the egg rolls, and the beef noodle bowl.  Everything was great!  I really liked the freshness of the chicken sandwich and the awesome sauce that came on it.  The pho is great and I love that it comes with everything you need to jazz it up on the side.  Since I am not a fan of cilantro, I was happy the second time that they honored my request to not put it in the soup... yay!  The egg rolls are crunchy deliciousness, which is a complement to any meal.  \n\nBasically what I am trying to say is I am thoroughly happy to have found this place- thank you yelp once again!"""

Otherwise Audi North Scottsdale won't  negociate I guess because like they say they are able to sell cars over the sticker price and rip pple off easily. Horrible that they say that representing Audi. My next car will be the R8 and I won't buy it at Penske Dealers. Audi Peoria was by far the worst one offering a monthly pmt of $769 for a lease on a Q5 MSRP $38,725. I would recommend pple NOT TO BUY AN AUDI IN AZ, Chandler, Scottsdale or Peoria.

The sauce was ok, it wasn't the normal sweet chilli sauce that I am used to back in NC, but it was edible.  The other dish I ordered was new to the menu, the Cantonese style noodles with shrimp and chicken.  I asked the girl behind the counter if they were like Singapore Noodles and she said yes.  I ordered it but when I got it home, I had a take out container filled with crispy noodles, ($11.50) there was a jar of what looked like soup, I didnt know if the two were meant to go together but it wasn't very nice.  All in all, very dissappointed and will not be trying this a third time, I'm shocked as the place seemed pretty busy when I was there to pick up.  Splash out and go to PF Changs at Happy Valley."""

I have taken around 30 credits here, and although I have a pretty decent GPA, some of the part-time online instructors are fairly 'feral' towards students( for some odd reason) which just messes up my degree plans.\n\n  MCC has a 16% (or was it 14%?)  graduation rate. The lowest in the nation. You can see the statistics yourself if you log into your FAFSA. Who needs a degree- right? Obviously this is play time. (sarcasm) \n\nI'd say avoid the Religion at MCC, that one is a joke- save your money! I think it is ran by a bunch of secular-rabid-lesbian atheists."""
"2,""I was here because my friend was having a baby. Of course I couldn't wait to see the little one, so I had to go visit. When I walked in, I noticed that the hospital was clean. I was paying attention because someone that I cared about was there and I wanted to make sure they were in a nice clean place. I noticed that the nurses were very attentive and caring. They helped my friend out so much! Nothing but a pleasant experience here."""
"1,""If I could give 0 stars I would!  My daughter's prom was after most other ones nearby.  We went here because it was recommended.  BAD IDEA!! She is a size 16.  Certainly not out of the ordinary! Their selection was small.  She found 1 she liked, but it was too big.  Since I know nothing about it, I trusted the saleswoman when she said alterations would be simple.  So we bought it \""""all sales final\"""".  We knew of a tailor who is good and trustworthy.  When we showed up for the fitting the tailor was shocked!  It was a good 10 inches too big!  She would have to completely rebuild the bodice!  Since all sales are final, we could waste it and get a new dress, or pay for the alterations.  So we got the alterations... Which DOUBLED the cost of the dress!  (and I strongly suspect the seamstress gave us a break because we got fooled so badly by this store!).  Bottom line:  BE VERY CAUTIOUS!!! If the dress is not perfect, don't BUY HERE!!!"""
"1,""Played here yesterday. Cheap and fun golf, but the staff (particularly the ranger) was extremely rude and unprofessional. Went out of his way to flex his muscles and ridicule us.\n\nBeen playing a lot of golf in the area recently. My advice is to head down the road to Ken McDonald in Tempe. Similar value, just as fun, and a professional and courteous staff that respects their patrons and is interested in people having a good time."""

"2,""This was my first time here, and it was good. I had an AK-47 \""""pinner\"""" which is the medium size, roast beef, mushroom, and red onion sandwich with Au jus dip, and it was pretty tasty.

"1,""We always wanted to go this place due to the fact that many other Hong Kong Chinese restaurants are really good and it seem like it was like a great authentic Chinese food place to go to.  This is by far the worst place i have ever been. \n I ordered the egg fu yung, it came with 3 patties, just green onions on top and gravy. no other vegetables or other condiments like I have at other places and worst of all it was burnt.\n We ordered Peking Pork Chops and it tasted like orange chicken, try figure. \nAnd last we ordered Seafood Chow fun, it was slimy and seafood was chewy, uncooked and no flavor what so ever.  \nThe top it all off, we were not offered any other drinks, server just gave us water that tasted so bad due to the fact probably because the glass cups were not washed well as you could see other lip stains. We all felt grossed out and sick after and my 3 year old daughter was nauseated  all the way home.  Me and my wife had a headache as well. Probably because, i presumed of the MSG and uncooked seafood and the overcooked egg fu yung.  \nLast, it was 105 degrees outside and I was sweating like a pig inside with there ceiling fans off and the A/C prob seem like it was set at 90 degrees.\nFirst and last time at this place."""
"1,""I used to go here often when I went to MCC.  I admit that the food was pretty good, but the owner ruined the entire experience for me.  At the time, I was learning Japanese and wanted to try it out in an actual setting.  He yelled at me the first time I tried and told me to speak English.\n\nAnother instance, and the real reason I don't go back there, is when a friend of mine went to eat there.  After he finished, he said \""""Gochisousamadeshita\"""" (a polite saying thanking the preparer of the food for the meal) and the owner muttered under his breath \""""Henna Gaijin\"""" (strange foreigner).\n\nI can understand not having the patience to speak Japanese with me, but really.....insulting someone who just thanked you for the food?  That's enough for me to never return."""
"2,""I'm giving this place 5 stars because I'm a sucker for mom-and-pop places. An elder Japanese couple runs this restaurant (apparently since 1983!!), with no help. Just the two of them bussing and cooking and taking orders. \n\nFor all the previous reviews who complain about the lack of fawning service....REALLY? The elder man handles all the tables by himself. The wife stays in the back. This couple works side by side, all day every day. They make straightforward good food. No frills. Don't nitpick--try to do what they do all year round and see where your priorities are. \n\nAnyways, on to the food:\n\nGyoza: Very good! Perfectly pan-fried, flavorful, and not too oily.\n\nCurry Katsu over Rice: Delicious! I wish they put the pork katsu on top of the curry so that it doesn't lose some of the crisp sitting in the sauce. But it was delicious! The curry was thick and the proportion to the rice was perfect. \n\nTonkotsu Ramen: Definitely did not come with the typical ramen toppings like wakame, charsiu and bamboo. It came topped with Chinese cabbage and chicken. It was almost more like Chinese noodle soup haha. If I were to judge it as a ramen, it wouldn't be good. But as a noodle/soup dish, it was good.\n\nSoft Shell Crab roll: Okay, sushi is definitely not their strength. I would not order another roll from here. There was too much mayo (the presence of mayo was already odd), the sushi rice was not the right consistency, and the nori was soggy.  The inari that came with my tonkotsu ramen tasted a little odd as well. It's ok, they have plenty of other things I need to try on the menu!\n\nIf this review was based purely on food, I'd give it 3.5 stars. But I really appreciated how hard-working the couple works! So 5 stars all the way!"""
"2,""A solid 3.5 stars (I'm Korean and was raised in L.A.,  so my standards are pretty high).  Like Mexican and Chinese food, good Korean food is another thing that is hard to come by in the Valley (near Tempe).  The only places that I think are even worth mentioning are: Chodang, Hodori, and Takamatsu.  All three have their pros and cons.  I have posted separate reviews of Chodang and Takamatsu.  Besides going to Chodang and Takamatsu for specific reasons, Hadori is where my husband and I go if we have unspecified hankerings for Korean food.  They have a wide range of offerings and they are all pretty good, and my husband likes their BBQ the best."""
"2,""First off, try the kimchi!\n\nI'd give Hodori five stars, because the food is really great. What ruined it for me was the service. The server, whose name escapes me, was very short with us"
"2,""I have been here a handful of times now. Although I am not a fan of their Soft Tofu, everything else seems to be well-prepared. They also have good side dishes."""
"2,""Food is always good. We have never been disappointed when coming here. It's a little pricey, but the portions are always a good size as well. Especially lunch. Like most reviews the service does lack everytime we are here, but the food makes up for it."""
"1,""They food is AMAZING but the service is horrible and the place is so dirty. There were bugs crawling everywhere made us loose out appetite. I love me some Popeyes chicken but not when the place is this dirty. I've worked at a Popeyes before so I know how exhausting it can get but c'mon!!"""
"2,""My sister and I always go here as did my father when he was alive.  They are always polite and remember our names.  I've taken others as well and they enjoyed it!!"""
"1,""Chips, bean dip, and salsa was ok. Green burrito, rice and beans were below average. There was no green chili flavor at all - basically it was a brownish, dull flavor. The meat chunks were tough and not fit to eat. The rice and beans tasted a few days old. Margarita was ok, not much alcohol though. I usually go to Rositas which is right across the street - their green burrito (try it smothered in green sauce and cheese) is 100 x's better than Serranos - in fact every thing is better at Rositas. I will head over to the chandler Serranos and try that next time - hopefully they don't bring their food in from the same place as this one.  Honestly I can't believe this place is still in business. Try Rositas instead for some excellent mexican food."""
"1,""Not this location specifically but the bank itself is crap. \n\nToday was supposed to be my billing date on my credit card. Went into a branch and they asked if I wanted to take all my money out of my checking account. Honestly how dumb can you get? Then the servers just happened to crash. I was told to call the number on the back of my card. I did just that. A few times. \n\nThe first guy did the same thing as when I was in the branch itself. Thought I wanted to take money out of my checking account. Seriously? Okay. Nope. Screw you too. I said I wanted them to take money from my checking account to pay my credit card bill. But that it was whatever now and hung up. I'm not wasting my time dealing with you and your crap when I have more important things to do. \n\nI call again and this guy tells me that to pay the bill over the phone there is a service fee. First thing I did was hang up. \n\nSeriously? A service fee to pay my freaking bill. That I've been trying to take care of for the last hour? Okay that makes no sense. \n\nSo now that I have discovered how truly horribly they are able to take care of their customers I'm really really planning on getting rid of any and all service I will ever have there. \n\nWhat is the point in trying to do what you need to when all they do I say is you have to pay this much more for us to do what you need to be done. Or that the only way we can help you is by making you jump through 200 different hoops. Nope. Screw all of you. I'm done."""

At one point the doctor even argued with me and would never listen to what I had to say.  When asking about a treatment for another of my dogs, I was insulted by Dr Kile.  I will NEVER bring a single dog back to this place which is sad cause their office is so close to my home."""
"1,""I don't get this place.  They have multiple buildings and multiple doctors in each building but it is damn near impossible to get an appointment unless you call them 7:30am SHARP!  My 6 month old daughter was sick quite often in the first few months of her life and we had to bring her in quite often.  I had better chances of getting tickets to a sold out concert than an appointment at this practice. \n\nWhen you do get an appointment, doctors constantly contradict each other and put each others diagnosis down often.  I have heard the words, \""""Don't listen to that doctor, I know what I am talking about.\""""  \n\nAs a parent of two small children, that is not all to reassuring.  Honestly, I prefer the staff at Conerstone Urgent Care a lot better that this staff.  So you might ask, why do we still go?  The reason, we've had doctors in the valley ten times worse than these people.  They are organized,  they are clean and I like how all their computers are networked through all their offices.  This place is a lessor of other evils.... I personally think they see waaaay too many patients to have a relationship with the family.  When we go, I feel like a number and a price tag to them."""
"1,""Stay away!  This place is awful.  We came home from a camping trip to the A/C being out and not being able to stay in our home, so we came here for a night.  The room smelled stale and gross, and was poorly lit.  We could not control the temperature in the room and I doubt it cooled off below 85 degrees in there (not much of an improvement to the house!).  There were 2 queen beds and we requested a roll-away since we were there with our three children.  Knowing that we had 5 people in our party, we were still only provided with 3 towels and 2 washcloths in the room.  The d\u00e9cor, the furniture and the paint are all in SEVERE need of an update.\nMy husband and I thought we'd go down to the pool to help cool off.  WRONG!  the pool area was filthy dirty.  There were dirty pool towels laying about, but no clean pool towels available for us to use.  The pool had some sort of film over it and the water was filled with all sorts of \""""floaties.\""""  The bottom of the pool was also filthy.  We tried to stick our feet in the hot tub instead, but that was also equally filthy.  The grounds were poorly kept, the trees and shrubs appear to be dying and no one has swept any of the walkways for what appears to be months.  This morning, the \""""free\"""" breakfast was burnt, dried out sausage patties, completely undercooked eggs, and stale potatoes.

"1,""I needed some slings for my JBL speargun. The shop had a decent supply of speargun slings, but not the particular size or brand I needed. The sales guy said he could order them and it would take about a week. So I gave him my contact information and he said he would call me when the slings arrived. Two weeks go by and no call from El Mar Dive Shop. I decided to head over to the shop and check on my order. The same guy who said he would order the slings tells me he forgot to place the order. He asked if I still wanted him to place the order, reluctantly I said ok. Again, he takes down my contact information and tells me he will give me a call when the slings arrive in about a week. Three weeks go by and again no call from El Mar. So again I decide to head over to the shop to check on my order. This time the same guy, I didn't get his name, says the slings arrived. I asked him why I didn't get a phone call, he acted surprised and said somebody should have called. He then lays the slings on the counter, but they are not the size that I ordered. He then tells me that the company they order from, Trident, only makes them in certain sizes and they didn't have my size. So this guy went ahead and ordered the wrong size for me anyway and then tried to sell them to me. I said no thanks and walked out. \n\nI always try to do business with local merchants. These days, with the economy the way it is, one would think that a business, especially a dive shop in the desert, would provide better customer service to earn peoples' repeat business. \n\nForgetting to place my order, failure to call me twice after saying they would, ordering the wrong size merchandise...three (actually four) strikes...YOU'RE OUT, El Mar!"""
"2,""Went T.V shopping here and had a great experience. Lady that helped us was very helpful. Answered all questions we had to help us make the best decision and did not feel pressured at all by her.

Nice options as well to pay your bill with them, online over the phone(is a fee) or directly in any store which is awesome! I'm all about convenience.  They do also do deliveries for you or you can take home the same day as well. Rule of thumb: if you can make it fit in your car/truck you can take it the same day or else you will have to do delivery.\n\nWill def be back for more home supplies.

"1,""I'm just following up on my previous review. Through the recommendation of my new Vet, I did opt to have an ultra sound (more detailed and less invasive, procedure than biopsy) performed, and discovered the dog had a sever infection of the prostate. The prostate had enlarged to twice the normal size. The infection was actually located on the outside of the prostate and could have spread and possibly killed the dog.  I'm glad I didn't take Dr. Anderson's advice not to perform the biopsy (or similar test). It took immediate surgery and three weeks of antibiotics , but my dog it doing much better. The cost was less than I had expected. I'm glad I didn't  waste any more time waiting for Dr. Anderson to return my  phone calls and recommend treatment. I feel stupid for even waiting that long, but like many people noted on their reviews they trust Dr. Anderson. I was no different, so I waited. I'm happy with my new vet, but sadly disappointed in my previous one."""

"1,""Read below the line of this post & you'll see my prior post.  I am a regular, or was a regular now!\n\nI never come in on Monday's,  I usually come in on Friday or Saturday.  This is the first time I ever met Bale.  I normally get served by Sarah & Jenn (who are the best & I like dearly).  \n\nThis night, Sarah served my first beer.  When Sarah went on break my beer was empty and I set my glass on the edge of the bar so the bartender knows I am ready for another.  Keep in mind, I am by myself at the end of the bar.  I see her look at my glass and walk away at least two times to serve others at the other end of the bar.  The third time I wave her down and she doesn't even give me a \""""I'm sorry I will be right with you\"""" (recognition of some sort).  So I do something I never done before and that is poor my own beer.  Now, I got her attention! After explaining to her why I did what I did (the fact that she was deliberately ignoring me), Sarah comes back from her break, and I explain what happened.  Sarah knows me and was very nice about her reasons of having to kick me out.  It is illegal to pour your own beer, now I admit, I was not thinking about that at the time, yet I am glad that happened just to prove a point.  It took me doing something like that to get Bale's attention, what does that say about a person like that.\n\nIn conclusion, I was told I can come back another night, but because of my action Sarah had to ask me to leave, I want to note that Sarah has always given me great service.  However, because of one person, Bale, I will not be coming back to this bar.  I have more class than that, to let someone treat me like I am nothing, when I am a consistent customer.  The sad thing about Bale, it is people like her that leave me hopeless in seeing this local economy thrive again.  I moved back to this neighborhood to support this area, yet people like her have made me decide to move back close to my job in downtown Phoenix  Everyone has to understand, I grew up in this area.  If you're a native like me, you'll understand, if not, you probably will not care.  The bottom line is thanks to the internet consumers like me have a voice.  Bale has got to go!\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLove this place.\n\nGreat dive bar, the bar tenders are really nice, they have the tall boy beers I like & mini pitchers for a good price.  \n\nI was impressed how much a crowd this place can draw in."""

"1,""I will not be giving my business to this Men's Wearhouse ever again.  I don't really like leaving negative posts, but I feel the need to inform everybody about the poor service at this location.  All of my groomsmen and I rented tuxedos from this location.  The price for our rentals were considerably higher than other stores , but I was okay with that.  I assumed the higher price was paying for the protection and service of a company like Men's Wearhouse.  I was wrong.\n\nWhen one of my groomsmen went to try on his tuxedo there was a used tissue in the pants pocket.  The pants were replaced on the spot.  I understand that mistakes happen, but we were assured every tuxedo was cleaned prior to rental.  Clearly, if this tuxedo had been cleaned there would not be gross Kleenex in the pocket.  Problem #1\n\nOn the day of the wedding, in the middle of picture taking, the same groomsmen had his top button of his jacket pop off.  Anyone who has worn a 2-button jack knows the top button is the most important.  You can't button your jacket properly without it!  Needless to say, we had to scramble to get the button attached with a safety pin while the photographer was waiting.  Problem #2\n\nI try to give businesses the benefit of the doubt.  If the used kleenex and the button were the only issues I honestly would not have written this post.  Unfortunately, the worst part of this whole experience has been the attitude and poor service of the Men's Wearhouse management once the tuxedos were returned.  I notified Men's Wearhouse of the situation - I expected them to be apologetic and offer some sort of a refund.  Instead, I was told that I would be receiving a call from a manager.  The call never came.  I called back a week later and was told that there was no manager in the building.  During my call a few days later I was told  the manager was with a client and I would be called back later in the day.  The third time I called I was told the manager did not arrive until 6pm and I would received a call right away.  My wedding was a month ago and I have still not received a call back from Men's Wearhouse. Problem #3\n\nOnce I realized I was getting nowhere with the Tempe Marketplace location I called the corporate customer relations dept. I still haven't accomplished much, but this department has been much more helpful in dealing with the terrible management at this location.\n\nI gave this rating 2 stars because all of the other tuxedos were very nice.  Unfortunately, once Men's Wearhouse had our money the customer service has been some of the worst I have ever dealt with.  I had my groomsmen pay a little more for their tuxes so that we could have the backing of a huge company like Men's Wearhouse on such an important day. I am very surprised at the poor service and I will never be going back to the Men's Wearhouse at Tempe Marketplace."""

"2,""This place is close to my house so I love it.  I also like the convenience of having a decent selection restaurants right in the same parking lot.  Great place if you want to take the family to dinner and a movie.  Inside the place is clean and they have plenty of people at the window and also a few automated ticket kiosks which are nice.  The seating is nice and the sound quality is great.  They have a larger theater for the \""""hot\"""" movies and it works great if you want to see something in 3D."""
"1,""Definitely not happy with AMC THEATER PRICES! Paying $10 fora Senior price on  Sat. afternoon after 4 pm is OUTRAGEOUS. We're using a gift card my husband rec'dc for his, Birthday, otherwise I wouldn't be coming here."""

"1,""totally terrible service. i've been to other buca locations in the bay area and i think i'll stick to that.\n\ni recommend getting the chicken marsala though. it's really good"""
"1,""This is an UPDATE on January 21, 2011, to my earlier reveiw that follows below.\n\nAfter the terrible experience we had on Thanksgiving, I wrote the Buca de Beppo corporate headquarters and sent them a copy of this review.\n\nI was frankly surprised to receive a personal reply from the company's Regional Director.\n\nIn addition to apologizing for the bad experience, she refunded the money we paid for our Thanksgiving dinner and sent us a gift card asking that we give them a second chance.\n\nWhile there was no excuse for the issues we encountered last Thanksgiving at the Mesa location, the parent company clearly cares about their customers so if you have a problem, WRITE THE COMPANY and you might be pleasantly surprised.\n\nAs for our return visit, took my dad there for his birthday and we had an OK time... not as good as I remember, but still enjoyable.\n***************************************************************************\nReview for 11/25/10\n\n2 or 3 years ago, we'd have rated Buca a good solid 3-4 stars for value, but my oh my how low they have fallen.\n\nI don't often rant about a restaurant unless I feel completely taken advantage of. That said, here I go.\n\nOrdered the Turkey Feast for Thanksgiving because in the past Buca always represented a good value. \n\nHA WHAT A JOKE!  Their use of the word Feast borders on deceptive advertising. \n\nA \""""Feast\"""" as defined by Webster:\n\na : an elaborate and usually abundant meal often accompanied by a ceremony or entertainment : banquet \nb (1) : something that gives unusual or abundant enjoyment\n\nThey should be calling it a Turkey appetizer, but before I expound further, I want to explain that my wife and I usually share an entree, so you'll know neither of us is a big eater. We went to Buca because we expected to have lots of leftovers over the weekend. NOT\n\nBuca claims it can feed 3 but I could have eaten the six (6) MINISCULE, REHEATED, COOL slices of white meat and 4 tablespoons of dressing by myself. What a RIP-OFF for $24.95!!\n\nThe extra side of salad was missing the usual pepperocini (only contained 1) so we had to request some on the side.\n\nThe baked Rigatoni pasta was DRY, DRY, STICK IN YOUR THROAT DRY and we had to request extra suace.\n\nAnd let's not forget the bread... whoever currently orders this for Buca doesn't know the meaning of Italian bread. What they served wasn't much more firm than Wonder bread and certainly a far cry from REAL, Crusty, Coarse Italian bread like you find at Brio, Maggianos or any other restaurant with Italian roots. You can find better Italian bread at COSTCO than at this place... in fact, they'd make a huge improvement in the authenticity of the meal by getting their bread from COSTCO instead of the bakery they are using.\n\nAnd yes, we could have sent all the food back, but we decided to be Thankful for our ability to go out and enjoy a beautiful day, as well as not cause a scene in the restaurant and spoil anyone else's enjoyment of the holiday. Our response instead  will be to never visit one of their restaurants again.\n\nPLEASE do yourself and your family a favor by avoiding Buca de Beppo at all costs. This company should be out of business so something better could fill the space.\n\nGo to your local Italian restaurant, run by a local family, rather than this corporate theme restaurant that has forgotten the quality and value that made them famous in the beginning.\n\nIf we could rate ZERO stars we'd have done so."""
"1,""Wow! I guess I'm not the only one that will never go back. First off We stopped going about a year ago only because money got tight. This used to be my favorite place. Its always been expensive but you used to get what you paid for. The meals stayed extreamly expensive but the portion sizes got a lot smaller. The spaghetti sauce was tasteless  The garlic bread used to come in a pizza pie pan and was covered with butter and garlic. It was delectable. Now, $8 gets you a small dry pieces of crap. I could have made this at home for about .99 cents. The waiter and management were very un-accommodating when it came to a $10 gift card that wasn't actually good in another 2 hours. Come on give us a break. No chocolate milk for the kids. Pepsi products BIG MISTAKE!   And the final straw,, The icecream desert clearly said 6 scoops of ice cream on the menu. I counted 2. \n\nSorry Buca, Never Again!"""
"1,""We went out to Bucca on Monday night. While the food was decent the service was horrible. \n\nFirst we started out with a male server that seemed to find waiting on us as a burden. Then a female server took over who had no idea about service. OUr drinks sat empty, nobody asked us how the food was and the check literally took over 10 minutes to arrive- even after asking for it. \n\nI'm not sure I'd ever go back."""
"1,""I went here for a 'nice' steak dinner. however, i think 'nice' is actually 'bleh'.\n\nAll I wanted was a big, fat hunk of delicious meat and some healthy vegetables. Apparently they have vegetables but I wouldn't call them healthy. They have green beans, and I'm sure they are delicious with all the butter and bacon they are cooked in but I am 100% sticking to my New Years resolution. I asked instead if I could have fresh green beans cooked by themselves. My waitress said NO.\n\nNO?! you mean you don't have fresh vegetables?\n\nEverything they have is already premade and nothing is fresh. GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe steak was bland and I pretty much used an entire mound of salt for flavor. It ended up being like $20 bucks after tip. Totally ridiculous. \n\nI don't understand restaurants that don't use fresh vegetables and nothing can be cooked to order. that totally grosses me out. I will not be back. If I was by myself I would have left when I found out nothing was fresh, but I was with people and didn't want to insult them because one of them chose this place?"""
"2,""One of my favorite meals is a good steak and a potato, and I must say, I have never been disappointed coming to the Texas Roadhouse. I love the peanuts at the table. I start eating some of those right away. Iced tea is good and they keep it filled up for me. I've never had a bad waitress here. They wear really skippy short shorts here, which doesn't bother me, just an observation. I imagine that for the guys to get the good tips? The rolls are pretty good, but I wait till the end to eat one due to the honey butter that comes with it. I don't like my sweet at the beginning, only at the end. :) I order my steak medium, and it came out flavorful and juicy. I eat the whole potato, skin and all, its so good. I have met the creepy balloon guy. He's just an old man trying to make a living, cut the guy a break. I just politely said no, I would not like a balloon and he went away. Pricewise, under $20 for lunch, which for a steak restaurant, not a bad deal. If you want that nice feeling of fullness after eating a good meal, I highly recommend this restaurant."""
"1,""Had lunch here today with Robyn N. Jeromy H. and Rand H, Well for starters almost everything at the buffet was room temp. The food was not bad but would have been better hot.The soft serve ice cream was a real watery type. Any way dont waste your time here there is better across the street."""
"2,""I enjoyed going to this place with my daughter. Good atmosphere and the staff was friendly. Pick a piece off the shelf, sit down, listen to some good pointers and then paint away. Set aside a couple of hours if you are doing something detailed as you want to get three good coats of color."""
"1,""This place disappoints.  One time I came in and they stuffed my bagel and lox with so many capers that it inedible, I had to flick them all off.  The last time I came in (and I do mean last) there were a group of teens working... well not actually working but standing around talking and playing tricks on each other.  When they finished making my bagel they just let it sit there and didn't bother calling my name.  I had to interrupt them and ask them if I could have my bagel.  It's disappointing because I use to come in this place often and the service was quick and friendly but they must be under new management now."""
"1,""This store SUCKS! DO NOT GO HERE!\n\nIn the last month, we have walked in, and immediately walked out as the NEVER have bagels.  There were 4 kinds there today, if that.  I actually had to ask if they made bagels there.  The customer service sucks even more than the selection.  I have almost jumped over the counter on a few occasions.\n\nWe keep going there like idiots, and end up having to go to a different EB on Val Vista.  That one is GREAT!\n\nWhen we went into the Val Vista one today, we talked about how horrible the other store is, and almost every employee has said that they hear about how bad the Gilbert store is all the time.  Then, another customer overheard us and she said she lives right next to the Gilbert store and still has to drive to Val Vista one because of how bad this one is.  She mentioned that she even complained to a Regional Manager.  so she was nice enough to give me his info.\n\nBOTTOM LINE.  If you like Einstein's Bagels, DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE.  They say they make bagels, but they don't.  The employees are rude, inconsiderate and could care less what you think.\n\nDO NOT GO HERE!"""
"1,""If you want to have a bagel don't go here.  We routinely drive past this store to one several miles further away because this store runs out of pretty much everything early and doesn't seem to care at all.  If you just want a quiet place to study or read it's probably good enough."""
"1,""I had been going to them for years, but stopped a few years back feeling they lacked the attention to detail they once had. This feeling was confirmed recently when issues started presenting themselves. I've discovered incorrect parts (wrong size fuel filter, etc.) were installed...and the freeze plug they left in my engine! A few years back I had them replace some freeze plugs that were leaking. Well, they didn't tell me one popped into my engine and they did not try to retrieve it! A month ago the plug worked its way into my pump. Engine smoked, seized, and shredded my s-belt. Luckily it happened on a side street where I could immediately pull over, turn off the car, and have AAA tow to their shop. AAA discovered the issue, pulled the mangled plug out of my pump. Repair job costing me a few hundred dollars. I say lucky, because it could have been far worse, like the car is on the highway moving to another state and/or I completely lose the engine. I would be leery of their work. Especially with a safety concern. The attention to detail they once had, is and has been gone for some time now. Your better off doing the work yourself or taking it to AAA. The local AAA shop on E. Valley Auto Drive has been great these past few years, saved my car, talk the issue out with me, show me the parts they removed, etc.. They are worth every penny!"""
"1,""Aah, Old Country Buffet, one of the first buffets I ever went to growing up. As a matter of fact, this and the Superstition Springs one were the two I went to.\n\nAbout maybe 11 years ago, we went to the S. Springs location.  We went there probably once a month and enjoyed it each time.  Until one day, we noticed the rotisserie chicken wasn't cooked all the way.  All my mom did was ask the waiter to tell the cook that the chicken wasn't cooked all the way.  Then they got the manager and he scolded us saying \""""Well, you guys are just trying to get a free meal\""""  After a little big of an argument (mellow on my mom's side) we left.  Last time I ever been to one.. until a couple weeks ago.\n\nAnyways, enough about the past.  Went here for a lunch one day, just, you know, see if it changed at all.  Walked in the door and totally remember the winding entrance (be quiet, it's nostalgia for me).  Were greeted and seated right away.  I remember the big drink station in the middle.  There were a lot of tables of course, then I looked at the buffet.  \""""Wheres all the food?\""""  I know it was lunch time, but the buffet was way small.  I've been to dozens of buffet's since this place and this place is childs play compared to others.  \n\nThe quality of the food is pretty much the same since I last remembered, maybe a slight less.  Probably won't come here again though, there's other buffet's out there"""
"1,""Very dirty!!!!\n\nAs soon as you walk in to this place you are hit with a terrible smell. You can tell that it is older so there is only so much that can be done. The laser tag itself was pretty decent but everything else wasnt great. The arcade is small and the food is terrible. Bathrooms were clean enough for me to use but all around not an impressive place."""
"1,""Fun, but for a family of 4 to go two times, it's $78, way too expensive to come back!!"""
"1,""Rachel Ray says if you see a restaurant with a line, it's a good sign the food is good. Restaurants know this too and I think often they create a false perception by making people wait. When a customer walks in, sees a full lobby, and is given a short wait the expectations are increased. When I arrived I noticed the parking lot was not that full. Multiple parking places up front and on each side. I walked in to see 5 people waiting"
"1,""Place works very slow the severs keep playing around and when I got my spinach artichoke dip there was noodles on the inside of it."""
"1,""I had the teriyaki chicken, which was pretty good and very flavorful. The cashier, who seemed to be the owners son, was rude and could not crack a smile or thank me for my business. He loudly spouted off his views on gun control, which I think as an associate was inappropriate. He also got into a verbal disagreement with the customer ahead of me due to the fact that the associate would not get off the phone with his father to assist the paying customer. He yelled at the customer and was extremely disrespectful. I didn't appreciate the way I was treated, and I can certainly find a chicken teriyaki elsewhere."""
"2,""Great sushi.  I've been coming here for the past 5 years.  Their service can be a little slow at times, especially weekend nights.  However the rolls & sushimi are top notch."""

"1,""I like Trader Joe's, just not a big fan of this location.  It's an extremely small store and someone always seems to be crawling up your arse.  They got a weird parking lot too.  I drive a few more miles and go to the Traders located on McKlintock & Gaudalupe."""
"2,""One of my favorite places to shop at! Their food is amazing and a lot of their stuff you can't find at your local grocery store. They have quality flower bouquets that are cheap. I love how they have little shopping carts so that your children won't be bored and can help you out. I obviously know that if I go on a weekend it will be busier than going on a weekday. It shouldn't be such a surprise since its like that everywhere else you go."""
"1,""Was here recently and service was terrible plus food was not as tasty as it has been at other Macaroni Grills I have been to.

I was really surprised because I have eaten at several Macaroni Grills in valley, Tucson and in other states."""
"1,""I went here the other night and it was a fairly not awesome experience. We got there early, and there were only a few people working there. This resulted in us waiting quite a bit to be seated and to get service. We both got the make your own pasta and I got a side caesar salad. I had to wait with my salad for a long time because I didn't have a fork....pretty weird. I felt like I was in coming to America or something. The food was completely bland. I had a mix of arrabiata sauce and garlic...two strong flavors....yet it had no flavor. I just wish I remembered how much this place is not good before I decide to go there again."""

"1,""Horrible place! Do not take your pet to Dr Archuleta. I took my boxer here to be neutered and within 2 days his testicles started swelling. My husband took him back in and the vet blamed us. Said he was to active. He was gated in a 4ft by 5ft area. This is a full grown boxer. Noway was he too active! They gave an anti inflammatory but no antibiotic. Oh and if course they charged us for it! They next day they were even worse so we took him to our regular vet to find out he had an internal infection due to how rough and unsanitary Dr Archuleta was. In turn my poor baby had to have drain tubes put in to get rid of the infection. They might be low cost but in the long run it cost us 4 times what it should have and my baby shouldn't have had to go thru this! Supposedly they are suppose to care about animals but all they care about is their bottom line! If they did care they wouldn't be so rough and hurt them!! I did go back and let them know what my own vet had determined and Dr Archuleta wouldn't even come out to talk to me. The girl at the desk was as far as I got and she could of cared less. She was so rude! I will NEVER refer anyone to them. Not after they almost killed my baby!"""
"1,""Had take out from this location.  They forgot several items and skimped on food.  I purchased about $70.00 worth of food and even I called to inform the manager what happened he said he would fix it and compensate me... I got a $10.00 voucher in the mail about two Weeks later...

Plenty of available tables but none the less, was asked to sit there.  We were greeted by a nice enough server and she explained the new MiniPad system.  We immediately ordered strawberry lemonade and iced tea.  (2 of us)\n\nWhen the drinks arrived, we ordered from the menu.  My lunch partner had the steak fajitas and I thought to try something new on the menu, Chipotle Shrimp Bowl  The photo looked wonderful.\n\n40 minutes later... yes, FORTY MINUTES LATER...and after seven other tables seated AFTER US by at least 10 minutes were served, our food arrived.  I was famished.  \n\nFirst bite of my bowl was a piece of chipotle shrimp and lettuce and the food was COLD.  Odd, I thought this was grilled shrimp.  So, I bit into another one and yep, cold.  So I broke open one and it was raw.  Yep.  Raw shrimp.\n\nI called the manager over who seemed amazed the food was cold and didn't really respond that it took 40 minutes to arrive and offered me a bowl of soup.  (its 110 degrees outside today.)\n\nNo thank you.  Just the check please.  After 10 minutes, we received a to go order we placed 30 minutes prior and now the server had a huge attitude with us.  I guess being angry at waiting so long and getting raw shrimp served to us is no reason to be upset in her world.\n\nI left a 1.00 tip and we left.  \n\nI will not go back here and I urge anybody reading this... find someplace else to go."""
"1,""I have been saving money to get married recently, but we got a gift card for OTB, Chilis, Macaroni Grill or someother place I haven't heard of (Italian).  We always go to Chili's so we decided to go here.  I have been to other locations twice before and each experience was okay.  The chips were okay and the salsa was great.  It seemed fresh.  We got good service and the fiancee ordered a margarita which was tasty.  I just didn't enjoy the food as much as I do at a more authentic Mexican resaurant.  I ordered a chicken chimichanga and rice and beans and the refried beans have not been my favorite and nothing about the experience was bad there, but I just have no desire to go back any time soon.  The service was good, but this place was sort of blah.  If I lived back in Pennsylvania, it would be okay Mexican food, but out here in AZ it is nothing to go crazy for."""
"2,""Ok, so I recieved a free car wash from my Car Dealership to this place. I  admit, this was my first experience with Full Circle Auto Wash.  I guess they have several valley wide locations, and they are a full service auto salon.  \n\nI rolled up on a Sunday afternoon, expecting a ton of people.  Um, there wasnt.  I was a little surprised. Its a Sunday afternoon, the weather is nice, and Im like the only one there. Ok, so I roll up and it takes the guy a minute to come over to my car.  The first guy greets me and asks if I want the stone cracks in my windshield fixed.  No thanks!  \n\nThen, the order guy comes to my window, and asks what I want done.  I said that Ive never been here before and only want what the coupon says, which is a free basic wash.  I also mentioned that since I havent washed my car in a while, I have some dirt and breakdust buildup on my wheels, and if they could just make sure to get it all off for me, that would be great.  He told me that they just do basic stuff to the wheels, and if I want to pay an extra $3, they can shine my wheels for me.  I told him I didnt want my wheels shined, I just wanted to make sure that they were clean! \n\nI find that this place is comparable to a Dannys, but they do not have as many valley wide locations as Dannys does.  \nThe car itself came out clean, and the tires looked fine.

"1,""So, here's the deal... and I kind of feel bad for only two stars...\nWe went here for breakfast.  And the breakfast was okay.  It was... well... average.  I'm no cook- I'm a career girl.  But my breakfasts made at home KILL over what we got.  I was expecting breakfasty fireworks and culinary glory after a week of dieting and restraint.  It was a rare Sunday morning alone with my husband... no kids for a few glorious hours... and we decided to monumentally Have Breakfast.  \nI, of course, consulted my fellow Yelpers, who are generally the smartest, best, and brightest in the world... and having been to Giant Hamburgers for,well, a Giant Hamburger,years previously (which was FREAKING AMAZING) I thought that I could not go wrong in suggesting this place to my husband.  Many Yelpers highly recommended G.H. for breakfast so HOW could we go wrong?  And off we went.\nBetween the two of us, we were able to sample a fair range of food.\nOkay, so the toast was just cheap bread (think 2 loaves for $1 at a bread outlet... it shreds apart when you look at it sideways) the eggs were very plain and bland... bacon was okayyyyy (and I love bacon with an unholy passion so it's rare that bacon doesn't blow my skirt up) but just cheap, thin cuts, not particularly underdone but not the usual glory that bacon is.  I will say that I did somewhat enjoy the biscuits and gravy, but I would swear to you on any religious book that the biscuits were pre-packaged generic, not fresh/hand-made.  \nThe staff there is truly nice, and I like the personal service.  Saying hello.  Eye contact.  Genuine niceness.  This was consistent with my experience there a few years back, and it hasn't changed.  This kind of services is worth BUCKETS of cred in my book.\nWhat I *SEVERELY DISLIKED* was being the only english-speaking people in the restaurant for the last 15 minutes of our stay.  At one point, all the staff were speaking spanish, and after one older couple left, all of the diners were speaking spanish, and it was as though we had been transported to someplace nestled deep inside the manky heart of Guadalupe.  But without great food.  It was uncomfortable enough that we finished up, left some food behind, and bailed a little quicker than we probably would have. \nSo, although I am a big fan of the Giant Hamburgers at Giant Hamburger... I just didn't feel all the breakfasty love that other reviewers did."""
"1,""I love this kind of place. \nUnassuming, local greasy spoon-style diner. The staff was as friendly as could be. It was a Sunday, people were chatting. We ordered at the counter, got out glasses filled up with soda and took a seat.\nThe wait was longer than most fast foodies are used to, but to me, it was expected and welcome, fresh diner food made to order takes a tad longer than a microwave.\nThe Bride and I both had a Giant cheeseburger w fries. Granddaughter has hot dog and grandsaon a burger. (the kids being 5 and 12 were the ones who were used to fast food times) \nWhen brought to the table, the burger as shown in yelpers photo's... nothing magical, and certainly by todays indulgent standards FAR from \""""giant\"""" but a solid diner burger.\nFresh fries, nice hot, and crispy.\nHot dog, was a standard hot dog on a fresh bun.\n\nSo hey buddy... whats up with two stars?\nThe burger was as dry as could be! I couldn't understand it, fresh meat, not sitting out under a lamp to become shoe leather... (I've seen some sins done to meat in diners let me tell ya!)\n\nThen I saw that when cooking the patty, the cook puts one of those bacon weights on it and leaves it there. I could see the fat being squeezed out of it. \nLike greasy tears.\n\nPerhaps the breakfast is good, I don't know, seems like the sort of place it would be OK. But I just cant give more than two stars,,, \nI wanted to like it more, but frankly, a dry patty is a deal breaker to me."""

But our kids are all very well behaved despite the daggered looks from those who forget what it's like to have children. \n\nSpeaking of children, OSP is not very kid-friendly when it comes to certain areas that we apparently take for granted. There are no cups with lids on them at all. We were informed that they need to have a special 'license' for that from Pepsi. This is news to me as I've worked with Pepsi for years and know of no special license. The excuse was that they were afraid that people would take the kid cups, put alcoholic beverages in them and walk out of the restaurant. um...WHAT? Additionally, if you have a child who requires his pizza cut up into smaller pieces, good luck trying to find a knife there. There was 1 and I mean o-n-e (1) butter knife in the whole restaurant that we practically had to sign over our first born child in order to use. I'm pretty sure that the retirees aren't looking to shank each other in the parking lot so to have to play verbal judo with the staff to use a standard utensil was really ridiculous.\n\nThe restaurant is now cash-only. This means no debit or credit cards are taken but they conveniently have an ATM machine located in the lobby to not only dispense cash but charge a hefty $3 fee to use. If you want to have a refill on your drink, there is a charge for that too. Buying drinks by the pitcher is fine but it's soda...seriously? The pizza is alright, the salad bar is 1 trip only and is sparse at best. \n\nThe single saving grace of it all is the Organ. The piece de resistance. This is a good thing and a bad thing because given all that I've described, its simply not enough for me to drive an hour out of my way for an otherwise aggravating time between musical sets. While you're there, it makes those aggravating occurrences not quite so bad though because it's such a unique, memorable, interesting experience. I loved OSP as a child and enjoyed so many wonderful, memorable visits. Unfortunately, it's not always enough."""

"1,""I am so disappointed.  I stop here 2-3 times a week and today, they screwed my drink up AGAIN for like the 3rd time in the last couple of months.  I had to leave work to go back and have them fix it which is beyond frustrating and super inconvenient.  The kicker is they repeated my order back TWICE and repeated it correctly yet it was still not made right.  I was in the food/bevarage service industry for 10+ years and rarely did a customer have to return something back to me because I screwed it up.  No offense but this is NOT THAT HARD!  It drives me crazy when things like this happen often.  I understand every now and then but 3 times in the last 7-8 weeks is a little excessive.

The problem probably wasn't the management as much as it was the college kids with the wall of empty beer boxes separating their living room into two such rooms.. But still.  It makes me frustrated to even think about it.\n\nI will say this about the staff though.. They tried and tried for four straight months to correct the problem, and they posted all kinds of notices to inspect our apartments, AND, they even evicted a tenant or two..  So, in all fairness, they really did try....\n\nSo what should you do now?  Buy a house!  Thank goodness I have control of what happens in these walls. :)"""
"1,""I was there this weekend, both Saturday and Sunday for a Youth Tournament for my son. Our \""""home bowling alley\"""" is the Brunswick Zone on Southern and Dobson. This was my first time to this particular alley. This was the worst bowling alley I have ever been to in my entire 31 years of living. \n\nThe location is hidden back behind some office buildings. The building is plain, late 60's decor. The interior, from what I was told, had not been updated in over a decade at least. The newest renovation was a strip of fluorescent carpeting and some fluorescent paint on the walls. (for neon bowling I presume) \n\nThere is no real seating for the bowlers. There are tables and chairs randomly placed through out the building. Each table only gets 4 chairs, so if someone else steals a chair or you have more than 4 bowlers, someone is going to have to stand.  On a rack, in the corner, in the back, there are about 20 alley owned balls, so good luck getting one in the right weight. The bathrooms are tiny and dilapidated.  Whole chunks missing out of several spots in the tile. The handicapped stall has a baby changing station that does not fold up. It stays wide open, so you can't even get in there. The flusher in that stall also gushes when you flush, so you might want to flush with your foot. \n\nThere are only about 20 lanes, and they are occupied by what seems like permanent residents, over the age of 80. They didn't even want to leave for the alley-sponsored tournament. \n\nThe food was just thrown together. Nachos were a plate full of chips, and a tiny cup of cheese sauce. 2 small sodas ran me over $6. The overpriced snack bar didn't even accept credit/atm cards because their phone line was down. \n\nThe lanes were so slick and greasy, they practically had puddles of oil in them. Lane 4 occasionally goes completely dark while people are bowling. \n\nThey do NOT have a pro shop. Their arcade games were few, and broken. I don't think they serve alcohol.I did not see a bar.\n\nI would never, ever come to this bowling alley again by choice. Even the AMF on Main that closed last year was better than this one. They should have closed this one instead. If you're looking for a place to bowl, I would suggest you go anywhere but here."""
"2,""See, when I go to a bowling alley I expect loud and stinky and run down.\n\nThis location though had THE BEST SERVICE I have ever had at a bowling alley.

"1,""I contacted Superstition Springs Lexus via the internet and expressed interest in a used vehicle they advertised. We made an appointment to go out and see the vehicle and made sure the internet person was aware I was driving over 40 minutes to see the vehicle.  I received a number of texts letting me know they were waiting for me and provided me with the appointment time via text and email.  So far my experience was great.  About 30 minutes before our appointment, While driving out there, I received a message from a sales person named Steve.  His message said and they were waiting for us and wanted to confirm our appointment.  When we arrived, we met Rashad the internet sales person and he said we would be working with Steve.  We met Steve, and he was not the least bit friendly.  He appeared disheveled and was the typical used car sales person - not what I would have expected at a Lexus dealership.  He started talking about finding us a vehicle to which I told him we were out there to look at a specific vehicle.  He said he knew nothing about it even though I saw he was holding the sheet that had the information about the vehicle we were looking for.  He said he wasn't sure it was available.  I told him that if it wasn't, we would be leaving.  He went  and got the internet guy Rashad and we were advised the vehicle was no longer available but they would be happy to show us a different vehicle.  I told him the least he could have done was called me to save me the drive.  I completely understand that vehicles come and go, but the fact that they didn't advise me  when they had just left me a message, leads me to believe they were up to typical used car sales  tricks.  I'm assuming by the reviews that buying a new car at Superstition Springs Lexus is a different experience than buying a used one.  I made the decision to go to Superstition Springs Lexus because I thought they were a reputable dealership, I wanted to completely avoid the typical used car sales people.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what we got."""

I get the idea of wanting people to linger, but it is so chaotic to find anything that, in my case, it has the opposite effect.  There are a lot of books though, will give you that.\nTheir buy program is worse than any of the other bookstores.  Less than 5 percent of their half price resale, not the original price.

"1,""Farnworth is a HORRIBLE management company. I finally moved largely to get out from under them.

I was usually able to avoid the fines (since they were illegal and out of the lease), but it always meant writing legal-style letters back and forth, visiting the tenant advocates office in Phoenix, etc. etc. So it was a tremendous waste of my time, and they were beyond rude every time I contacted them.\n\nAnd then, when it was finally time to move, I deep-cleaned the apartment to a ridiculous extent. I had ex-military guys helping me, and we cleaned it to beyond military standards.

I referred tons of people to him because I really did like him. The last visit we were at I was there for my 3 and 4 year old. They both had ear infections and strep. I asked him about my 2 year old and he just checked her over since we were there. I asked him and even offered to schedule another appointment to take care of her if need be, but he did it as a favor since I was already there. Pretty awesome if you ask me. Before the end of the appointment, he does what he usually does, he looked me in the eye and said if I need anything, call him. \n\nSo the next day, when my two year old that he just checked over spiked a fever, I called and left a message. The nurse, who had been completely flat out wrong anytime I have ever asked her for advice, tried giving me advice but had no clue that Sam had looked over my little one the day before, as it wasn't notated. Totally a favor. No big deal, I ask her to please have HIM call me since he would know the situation. A few hours later, the same nurse called me back and said that Sam was slammed and couldn't call me back and continued to give me advice even though she didn't know the situation. Moral of the story, he didn't honor his words when he said to call him with questions. Honestly made me feel like he isn't truly a doctor who can provide care for my children. Bummer. \n\nWe have since been black listed because of a balance past due. They didn't have my new phone number, and I was too angry to call and pay the balance.

"2,""First off its a buffet , not a gourmet one you see at a high class vegas hotel or anything.. We moved here 8 mos ago from out of state and have been to another location but this particular location has been a great one! We usually go on Thurs nights because kids are only $1 to eat. Cant beat that! The food has been delicious both visits. The steak is Ranchers Reserve Sirloin and is always tasty and tender. The  hand carved roast beef is a perfect Med rare and is tasty and super tender as well. The servers stay busy so may not get plates off table super fast but its not that big of a deal.. We overall really are impressed with this location! They even have unlimited milk refills and and icee machine too with unlimited refills!!!!"""
"1,""First off, I'd rate this course a 2.5 but there are no half ratings. I've played this course a few times over the past few years, and this last experience really compelled me to write this review.\n\nI arrived an hour and 15 minutes before my tee time, walked into the pro shop and the staff was friendly. I know this place AUTOMATICALLY tacks on a $3 charge for the GPS on the carts, but they NEVER ask you if you want it or not. Upon paying, I said that I would like a small bucket of range balls and did not need the GPS on the cart. Once I mentioned the GPS, I got a smug look, told my total and given my receipt. Friendly happy staff when I walked in, grumpy unwelcoming staff when I walked out. I was not directed where to go, nor where to pick up range balls. Lucky for me, I remembered where the range was...hidden at the end of the drive and around the back of the building.\n\nI hit my range balls and walked to the starter. Took him a good 30 seconds to at least acknowledge my presence. After which, he grabs my slip and says, \""""We don't have a cart for you yet, and we won't until about 10 minutes before you tee off.\"""" I was like, \""""well F you buddy.\"""" I kept my composure and practiced putting. Sure enough, when the carts came around the corner, it was time for us to tee off.\n\nI failed to mention, that this was a Monday and I was shocked at how many people were out there. The groups were paired properly and sent out on time. Once we got out there, we experienced wet conditions all around the front nine. This was a 2:16 tee time and it was still soggy. The greens were in good shape, but the fairways were OK at best and the rough was a joke...clumps of grass here and there, bare spots and mud. \n\nThe pace of play was WAAAAYYYY too slow. Each hole we were waiting around and started waiting for the group in front of us to tee off. On hole seven, we pulled up and there was one group driving off the tee, another group behind them waiting, and another group, and then us! My partner called to pro shop to ask if they could send someone out to see what was causing this backup and the response he got was just sarcasm and a \""""what do you want me to do about it\"""" attitude. VERY unprofessional! Of course, we never saw anyone check up on us. Later on the beverage cart girl even mentioned that the pace was slow.\n\nNot only was the pace of play slow, but the people who play here (and what seems like, regularly) and the most inconsiderate golfers I've ever dealt with. Pulling up behind you while you are on your back swing, then locking their brake on your downswing. Come on! Constant chit chat and yelling when they are 10-20 feet away from you on another hole, and then driving up and passing as you are swinging.\n\nWe nearly cleared the front 9 in 2hr45min. After that, it temporarily picked up but then came to a screeching halt again and sped up when people realized we were running out of daylight. We had to call it as we finished hole 16 and that was 4hrs and 15mins into our round. Drove up to the cart return and after we got out of the cart and was unloading, the kid asked up to pull forward more. He came up to me as I finished packing and was unstrapping my clubs and he was kind of reaching over me to wipe down my clubs.\n\nWhat a poor experience. I won't be going back here for a while."""
"1,""I have enjoyed banking with desert schools until I moved to Mesa.  \nThe branch located at 4330 E Southern Ave Mesa, AZ 85206 gives desert schools a bad name.  They are by far the slowest location I've been to. I have been stuck in the drive thru line for 45 minutes...when I arrived there were only two cars in front of me and three cars in the next lane.

"1,""Have no clue what type of three ring circus the service shop is trying to pull off.  Had my 2006 GSXR 1000 In for a simple Valve adjustment was quoted over the phone $330 get there first thing they have me do is buy 90 bucks in parts.   Told me I had to bring my bike in cold so they could do the adjustment.  So i loaded it up in my truck the night before drove it there and dropped it off. Day later I get a call bike is done but they tried starting it and it wouldn't  idle/run and was pouring out black smoke,  not exactly what you want to hear after you drop off your perfectly running bike.   They asked if they could look into the problem more I said yes so they disconnected my power commander and found out that was the cause of the problem.  $325 Being hard to believe seeing how its less than a year old and was working just fine the day before.   When I went into the shop to pick up the bike they said they would hook back up the power commander and show me the problem. They started it up for me and long behold it was running just fine just like before.   So I have no clue what were they trying to do if they were trying to scam me into buying a new power commander and also charging me for them to look or a problem that never was their.  I have a feeling they hooked something up wrong the first time and correctly the second but do you think they would knock off some money off my $550 dollar bill nope this shop was very unprofessional and I would advise you to stay away from this shop.  Lesson learned.   Also when I brought my bike back home I noticed an air box screw stripped as well as the case cover bolt.    I HIGHLY  RECOMMEND going some where else for service."""
"1,""DON'T TAKE YOUR PETS HERE. Unfortunately, they were horrible. They are after all they can take from you. Your pets health is not at all the main subject.

They were not even busy or having a surgery in the back. If my cat needed a surgery I would probably take her there because they do seem to have a lot of technology BUT IF YOU supect that it is a stomach, respiratory or even a UTI I would take her to a vet that is not affiliated with a big corporation such as Banfield.

"1,""This review is for Delta Mechanical -- both AZ & CO. I live in CO but also dealt with the corporate office in AZ. I've tried to keep the review concise as possible...but the reality is, I could have written 10 pages on how disconnected the company is and just how little client service is to their organization.\n\nAs a third-party installer to Home Depot, Delta Mechanical was contracted to install a toilet for me and my family. I placed the order and scheduled the install one week out for an 8-10 AM delivery/install to minimize delays or issues.\n\nAt 8:30 on the day of install, I received a message from Delta Mechanical that they didn't have the necessary information to complete the scheduled install. I talked to both the installer and the corporate office to try and resolve. \n\nUpon my first call to the installer, I learned that although he might be a pro at installing toilets, he was anything but when it came to customer service skills.\n\nWhen I asked him what the problem was with the order and what he might need from me, he basically said, \""""I've already moved on to my next job. Nothing I can do.\"""" \n\nUnderstandable, considering the mix-up...only, he had ZERO interest or motivation to help. I asked that he call dispatch to find out what the issue was or where the disconnect occurred....to which he made it clear that he was busy and that he was already on his way to another job. WOW!...so, I was kind enough to give him a piece of my mind and how unprofessional that attitude was when facing a customer.\n\nThat's when I called the office directly to explain my frustration, having had to take off work for the original installation time and then to be told by the installer that helping me couldn't be fit on his plate at the moment.\n\nThat's when the customer service representative mentioned that she had called me \""""one hour\"""" prior to delivery to discuss the issue...the only problem is that she was in a different time zone, so it really was only 20 minutes before the schedule install time.\n\nSo, I quickly learned that I'm probably working with people who aren't quite ready to run a business or to handle customer service issues or problem solve. She said she would have to review the phone call order and \""""get back to me\"""", but offered no estimated timeframe or next steps -- one hour? one day? one week?\n\nClear to say that my frustration continued to grow. \n\nDelta Mechanical tried to blame it on Home Depot, but I sat at Home Depot when we originally placed the order and confirmed that all of the information had been given to Delta Mechanical.\n\nWhen talking to the customer service representative and eventually the Delta Mechanical Manager (George Ramos), they confirmed Delta Mechanical only looks at orders the day of installation, which makes ZERO business sense and probably a good reason as to why I'm as frustrated with them as other reviewers. \n\nI'm still baffled how an order placed 7-days in advance cannot be reviewed or confirmed prior to 20-minutes before install. SERIOUSLY!\n\nMr. Ramos' plan to fix it included me rescheduling my afternoon (already after rescheduling my morning) and to give me their \""""New Client Promotional\"""" rate with an added $20 off. Now, my bigger question was, \""""Why am I just now hearing about this  promotional rate now that I'm an unsatisfied customer and nearly two hours after the first sign of incompetence on Delta Mechanical?\"""" Rhetorical question of course.\n\nI let him know that promotional rates are for customers looking forward to doing business with Delta Mechanical, and that at the moment I was pretty dang far from that...having taken off work, rescheduled my weekend, and after spending two hours on the phone bouncing from installer to customer rep to manager while experiencing some of the most dreadful customer service ever -- without any resolution, other than $20 off their promotional rate they failed to offer upon my initial order and giving up my afternoon on top of the morning already wasted.\n\nMr. Ramos' response was, \""""It sounds like I should just cancel your order.\""""\n\nTalk about CUSTOMER SERVICE!\n\nI did call Home Depot back and we're in the process of making the situation better, including using another third-party installer instead of Delta Mechanical.\n\nI know I'm just one customer/voice, but I let Home Depot know that as long as Delta Mechanical is a third-party vendor, I will be taking my future purchases somewhere else.\n\nAgain, we're in the process of finding a remedy in conjunction with Home Depot, but the ONE GUARANTEE I have at the moment is that Delta Mechanical WILL NOT BE INVOLVED IN ANY WAY, thankfully!\n\nPlumbing and HVAC aren't my specialty, which is why I wanted the pros to do it...but take a lesson from me, there are a lot of companies and people who can install plumbing infrastructure the right way without leaving a soiled taste in your mouth. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go with another company that has a better overall rating that TWO STARS on Yelp...you won't regret."""

When a restaurant doesn't really take care of its guests it is a sure sign they don't want my money.  There are plenty of mediocre restaurants around - I want one that is great!"""

"1,""This shop held my bumper for four weeks and promised it in 3. They were to strip and straighten it . Then after a test fit, plate it. I called on a Wednesday of the forth week  before picking it up and they said it would be ready in two days. Called before heading over. Yep, it's ready. They hand me the bumper in the exact condition I dropped it off. Wasn't stripped, wasn't straight. Unbelievable. Not only does this place smell like an ashtray, they run it like one."""
"2,""Got my windows tinted here right before summer. Whew! My bartender recommended the place! I was informed of all of my different options, prices, effectiveness and even what might look best on my car while still preserving the integrity of it's appearance!

For those not familiar with guns this is a really comfortable place.  If you are a collector or are well versed it's a great place simply because they have so much to look at.  Also, they had ammo.  That was odd now days and a welcome sight.  Also, the prices were very competitive.  I highly recommend giving them a try."""
"1,""I've been here a few times and each time, my alterations have taken longer than quoted and without notice, and the service I have gotten is more-or-less rude. I have also had things measured on me there ahead of time which still did not fit properly after being altered."""

"1,""I've had Barro's before and the choices are ok and the pizza decent, but not spectacular. This was my first time at this location and I came with a few others.The pizza tasted okay, but wasn't cooked perfectly and the rest of the food wasn't overly memorable. The service, however, was terrible and the main reason for the 2 stars. The dining room had clearly not been vacuumed lately. The girls taking orders seemed in another world and there was a distinct lack of communication between everyone. They had to go back multiple times to confirm an order when there were barely 10 people in the place. We had to ask for silverware and they seemed put out when we asked. As we were there, a guy from the back brought heaping garbage cans through the restaurant. As far as I know, that's not sanitary. Also, the kids working had friends come in and start to socialize. There was definitely no adult on hand to monitor the situation. \n\nI'll be sticking with Spinatos or Oreganos for my quick pizza fix from now on. Better pizza and better service."""
"2,""...and the Five stars are not only because we've known the owners, Ray and Lynn for 20 years...as well as grinding there for just as long.

So if you cannot get out to Mesa to check 'em out there, you can stand in line at the upcoming Aloha Festival...you won't be disappointed!  There have been many Hawaiian food establishments that have come into the valley since, Ray and Lynn opened over 20 years ago.   and, there are lots of good reasons (on their menu) why they are still serving ono-licious Hawaiian style food...its da sticky rice, brah....naw only keeding....Its da food!

"1,""Sorry AK, maybe I was just grumpy that day since I hadn't eaten for a gazillion hours....c'mon, I'm not the only one who goes all Beast Mode when hungry, right?...but the food here just did not hit the spot for our Hawaiian food craving. Let me start by saying the place itself looks like a legit Hawaiian restaurant with it's low key vibe and simple style. The menu has a lot of choices which is great. I, for one, have a go to meal plan when I nom Hawaiian style which includes chicken katsu and mac salad, of course. The food did not taste bad in any way...it just wasn't my style. The Katsu was thin, dry and chewy and the sauce was the tangier kind vs. the sweeter kind that I like. The mac salad was okay but the more I ate the less I liked it...when normally I order an extra side of mac salad to devour with my meal. Again, I may have just been grumpy gal that day but I still find myself craving my Hawaiian spot in the OC."""
"2,""Use to live in Phoenix while going there for school and work.  Came back this past week and the food was great as usual.  I also brought a friend who's never tried Hawaiian food and loved the mac/potato salad, katsu bulgogi plate.  Keep up the great work guys and Mahalo."""
"2,""I love this place!  Been coming here since 2000 when I moved here from Hawaii.  Whenever I need my comfort food I order the fried saimin. It's the best!

I can go there and count on a nicely prepared eggs benedict dish every time.  Crackers is not the type of place that would be capable of making a decent Hollandaise or even poaching an egg properly. \n\nI wouldn't be quite so hard on this place if their rating wasn't so outrageous.  I want to help others avoid going here with high hopes of an outstanding breakfast and come away with a belly full of unmemorable food.

"1,""This was my 2nd try at this salon. The 1st time I wasn't very happy. I had better hair cuts at salons at half the price. The left side wasn't cut the same as the right side, and not evenly tapered. But, I tried for a second time. Big mistake! This cut is harder to manage then the first. She did cut it very fast and I think she wanted to save her self some time by cutting it less layered at the top. This has left my hair wanting to lay too flat on top. \n\nBoth times I went to this salon I was the stylist's 1st appointment. Both times she was late. She was over 10 minutes late for work and she rushed me out with a speed cut."""

Instead of getting one from the back room, she called another department and asked to have one delivered to the front. After 10 minutes, we gave up and had to leave. 100,000+ Priority Club points and a second bottle 17-oz. bottle of  water is apparently an unreasonable request.\n\nThe room wasn't made up the first day by 4:30 in the afternoon - we had to call to request service.

Not everyone knows how to cook them and corned beef hash which I ordered WELL done.  Of course the top was cooked well and middle not at all so I asked if they could put it back on the grill to cook it more..  As they walked away we heard one guy tell the other to put it in the microwave!   Lol\n\nWhen I got it back.... Well, do I really need to tell you?  The food was hot but not cooked and the based eggs were literally rubberized... The yolk was hard not runny as a basted egg should be. \n\nOne of the guys came back and I told him the eggs weren't basted he insisted the were..  I picked the eggs up by the white and it dangled there looking like they were Rubber!\n\nI ate the cooked top part of the hash and half piece of toast and my husband ate his bacon and part of the pancake , we asked for our check and told him how disappointed we were and all he did was apologize ... I told him he should be offering to comp the un eaten meal ..  He gave me a funny look and took back the check and said it would come out of his paycheck!

"2,""This golf course was pretty nice.

Other courses that start doing that and end up 30+ minutes ahead and then others miss their scheduled tee time, when they are actually on time. Not here. They stuck to the schedule.\n\nPace: The pace was great. There was not the tight management as I have experienced at other courses. We did have a guy come and ask if the pace was ok for us, and we were fine. I didn't feel stressed about keeping up and we didn't really wait all that long by the time we got to the next hole. Other reviews may say the pace was too slow. That is their preference, but I wouldn't mark it down because of that. If you want a faster pace, go to another course that runs it that way.\n\nIt was a great relaxing time of golf, even though my game that day was horrible. :)  Of course, it is always horrible. I need to take some lessons. Hahaha.\n\nLayout: It is a bit dangerous with the layout on some of these holes. One of our guys was nearly hit by a ball within 3 feet.

We only tried the pizza by the slice, so cannot comment on anything else. \n\nGive it a try!"""

"1,""Unfortunately I need to downgrade my rating. I still think the service is great. Very friendly. However, there are some big things I'm noticing when I go back that really bother me...\n\nIt's increasingly cluttered and dirty. And most of the nail polish looks old and rancid.\n\nI get a basic mani and pedi here, which was working fine for me. Each time they would try to upsell me to gel, and finally I gave in.\n\nSo at 3x the price for my normal manicure, they told me it would last for 3 weeks. Hardly. 4 days later, the polish on my thumbs were totally chipped and there were lots of air bubbles that popped up. Being that I had French, the bubbles look black on my nails. So I went back to have it fixed.\n\nThe girl did a really sloppy job. Polish is too thick. My polish is already peeling up and it's only been a week.\n\nI already knew that their products are old so I would bring my own nail polish. But now I'm irritated because I feel like I was talked into gel and it only lasted as long as my regular manicure because they are using crappy old product (high probability) and the gel was poorly applied (lack of skill).\n\nSo, if i need something basic done for cheap and fast, I'll still go here. But if I need a quality job done, I'm going to pay a little more and go somewhere else."""

"1,""Okay, here it goes...this may get long winded but I swear it is a truthful and honest review, so please read closely\n\nI lived at Lakeside (formerly known as Lakeside Village) for over 3 years, through 2013 and I saw the old management company Con AM get bought out by another management company called Madrona Ridge. Con Am wasn't the best, but things went downhill when madrona ridge took over.\n\nWhen I first moved here they were literally giving apartments away, they were offering less than $500 per month for a 1 bedroom in a nice part of town, with a lake view, so it was a good deal. For the first 2 years there it was pretty solid, the managers knew my name, they cared about my problems and fixed anything I needed immediately, I'm talking same day service. They were nice people. Con AM and the old managers were nice to me and actually tried to show customer service...unlike the new management.\n\nAround the time Madrona Ridge took over things just got ratty. Loud and creepy people started moving in, bringing all of their loud and creepy friends with them. Supposedly they have a no crime policy and won't rent to criminals, yet the very loud and vocal neighbors loved to talk about their DUI's and jail time. A lot more weirdo people started showing up and walking around at night. I saw a drunk guy smash someone's windshield in a fit of rage and sped off, and someone did a nice hit and run on my car while it was parked...and of course nobody picked up their dog poop...at all. The landscapers didn't care to pick it up, the maintenance guys didn't care, so there it sat.\nMadrona Ridge promised all previous residents even better service than Con Am gave. I was wrapping up a lease when Madrona Ridge took over and they offered me an okay deal, so I stayed. But right after they started to get sloppy and dissapoint. They hired the current girls who manage Lakeside a few months later and their awful service started to show. \n\nThe current staff working here are probably the slowest, rudest, most impersonal women around. These girls Traci and Lucinda are NOT right for this job. They are NOT friendly or easy to deal with at all when you have a question or concern, they are NOT accommodating or welcoming, no smiles, just a bland \""""I don't care\"""" attitude. If you do anything to displease them or make them think hard they will treat you like dirt. They also won't bother remembering your name or showing you any kind of human service, they'll just call you \""""HEY\"""" or \""""You.\"""" Also, if you have a problem or a concern be sure to just walk in and demand to talk because they don't listen to their voicemails or return phone calls. \n\n I've had problems with bugs, repairs, questions, and rarely did they return a call or get anything moving unless you tell them again and again. In the early days when I needed something fixed con-am would have it fixed in a day or two, these girls will make sure it takes over a week if you're lucky. So either get good at fixing your own stuff or be prepared to wait, because as these managers know you aren't that important. Seriously...how hard is it to FAKE customer service? At least try to remember someone's name and care a little bit, a fake smile, anything helps, especially in a SALES position...you kill more flies with honey than vinegar. FYI.\n\nI left when they offered a renewal notice at the end of my lease, they offered me a new lease agreement that was ABSURD and overpriced. The one bedrooms here are 600 square feet, just tiny little run down apartments from the 1980's, and they are now asking $725.00+ per month...that doesn't include taxes, pet rent (if you have em) and utilities. So basically they are charging around $800 per month for a 600 sq. foot hole in the wall in an old crumby complex, when you can go find a nice, NEW, cleaner mark taylor or other luxury apartment for only a few dollars more per month. Uhhh yeah, no thanks lakeside! I did just that and found a better, nicer, newer place for only pennies more than here. \n\n Do not believe the website, it is totally false advertised. What you see online is NOT what you will get in person. What you'll really see are outdated appliances from the 80's, peeling paint, popcorn ceilings, cheap carpeting, tiny closets, and no storage space. \n\nLakeside used to be a lot better, I used to love it at first and I'm grateful for the good times I had while it lasted. The management used to be nicer, the grounds used to be cleaner, and the prices used to be reasonable. This place has delusions of grandeur...the managers think it's a luxury complex and are charging people ridiculous luxury prices for run down, ugly little apartments that are not worth their price tag, and the service you get isn't worth a dollar. \n\nThe area is pretty good and the lake is pretty at night time, there are nice walkways and some handy shops nearby, but honestly look elsewhere if you want both quality and value."""

My butt would be on fire the next am if I had a bowl if peppers and you want to charge me for the discomfort, good lord!!!...I requested to talk to management... His response was rude and advised me that even if I wanted a dab of sour cream or 1 slice of pepper they would charge for the bowl and to deal with it.  Total charge would have been 4.95.  I sent my entire plate back and said I guess I won't be paying for a dinner then or my margarita.  They could have made 20.00+ off me, but rather made zero.  The manager name is Usiel Molina.  He's rude and seriously should not be in customer service let alone management.  The others were not very pleased with the food.  The only thing this place has going is the patio environment."""

"1,""I had a recent incident where 2 dress shirts I had brought in for cleaning were misplaced. Things happen yes, but it has been a bit of a nightmare dealing with the owner, Amish Amin, regarding compensation. Not only has this dragged on but his low-ball idea of a resolution is a $50 store credit for shirts that retailed at $85 each. I have been a patron for going on 8 yrs as I live around the corner, and easily spent ~$3000 in that time span. Despite this, Mr Amin's rude, unprofessional and outright unscrupulous way of conducting business has guaranteed that I will not be patronizing this business anymore and want to notify anyone of how 'fair-minded' this shyster is. As an entrepreneur myself, you make it right with the customer for lost/damaged property. THAT is good business.. I recently was there and witnessed him yelling disparagingly at a female patron regarding a purse damaged during a cleaning. Your money is good there until they have to take responsibility for damaging or misplacing your merchandise...and then the customer service turns nasty. Talk about bad business. To be fair, the staff at the Baseline store are good people"

"2,""I've been to like 2 Vietnamese restaurants in my life, so I'm not an expert and can't compare this to anything else.  But I really liked the food and the flavors of this food.  I could see the menu being a little overwhelming but I asked some people who'd been before and checked the other Yelp reviews and decided on the following:\n\nBeef Chow Fun - Yum.  Greasy but excellent dish.  Kind of reminded me of Mongolian beef over noodles.   Fun indeed.\n\nSpicy Beef w/ Rice Noodles - Probably my favorite of the soups I tried.  This had a little bit more going on that just broth and noodles.  Good enough that at some point, I will crave a bowl and be back for it.\n\nFreshly Sliced Beef Pho - This was what I expected.  A kind of nicely flavored beef broth soup.  A little bland for me, but my kids LOVED it.\n\nPork Bun (pork and egg rolls on cold vermicelli noodles) - I was most surprised by this one.  Cold noodles and fish sauce makes me say \""""meh,\"""" but I really liked this dish.  Fish sauce and all.  Actually the sauce probably made the dish.\n\nAs everyone else has said, the places is pretty cheap.  Unlike everyone else... you can keep the darn spring rolls.  Egg roll... awesome.  Cold transparently wrapped bunches of tasteless lettuce... not so much."""
"1,""Update: Remember the friend thand had eaten the food with a fly? Well, today his wife just told me he has been going to the bathroom all day. I think he got food poison?

Here's why .\n\nWe ate with 2 other families. One of the families got their order wrong. Instead of apologizing,  the server kept pointing at the menu telling them that they got what they ordered. Then, my friend found a dead fly in his food. Disappointed friend talked to another  server about it. You know what the server said instead of simply apologizing?  She said \""""you sit by the door so the fly must have gotten in and on your food.\"""" My friend's wife said that the fly was already under the food.  Server replied, \""""no, no, no, no!\"""" She should have just apoligized so they could have moved on. They even had the audacity to charge them for the plate with the dead fly. My friends paid for it anyways. I could tell that they were trying to get rid of us. The other server gave our check even though we were still eating. He kept coming back for it thinking I would put my card on the bill. Later,  I see a server putting a shaved ice desert on our table. We didn't accept it. My friend said the damage has been done. All they needed was an apology,  but instead, the rude server kept on with her attitude.  Finally, the couple asked for the number of their manager. Rude server was upset. These people need to learn about customer service and ethics. I never make reviews.  When I do, it's  something everyone has to know about."""
"2,""The food and value at Saigon, bar none is a 10 for me.  I love the sliced beef pho #12 which I must order with an order of spring rolls.  The soup is always hot and fast with fresh sprouts, lime, and basil.  As for the spring rolls, well I have an addiction to these fried egg rolls wrapped in romaine lettuce and mint.  On occasion I will splurge and order a fresh drip ice coffee--a nice finish to a good meal.  \n\nThe service is swift and mildly courteous which is fine by me only because the food is exceptional!"""

The calzone crust was golden and delicious and the sauce was also very good. But you wanna know the best part? Our very filling dinner cost 12$. That's right. 12$. That is crazy ridiculous!

"1,""When I noticed my kitty starting to constantly, vigorously scratch her head, especially around her eye, I made an appointment for here.  Went to the appointment and waited for almost 3 hours before seeing anyone. Hearing all the dogs barking for that long terrified her that much more.  Then I finally got in waited some more, saw the vet assistant for only a couple minutes and again waited almost another hour before finally seeing the actual vet.\nNo apologies for waiting all afternoon, no sympathy or compassion shown for a sick kitty.  Felt like I just took my car in to the repair shop.  She was examined, had tests run and the vet comes back and says Chloe (my cat) has ear mites.  I asked how thats possible.  She lives in a clean house, never goes outside, my other cat is fine.  The response was \""""I dont know, but she has mites\"""".   3 different meds were prescribed and follow up was scheduled.   At the follow up, we saw a different vet who treated her better.  He explained everything to me, including pricing. I again asked about the ear mites.  He looked at her file and said she never had ear mites!  She just had a deep ear infection.\nHere's the kicker.  The first time she was brought in, she was so scared she had a little \""""accident\"""" in her kennel.  I grabbed some tissues and immediately cleaned it up.  I asked the assistant where a garbage can was, she took the tissues from me and threw it out and then charged me a \""""medical waste disposal fee\"""" of $4!  \nOverall, I would only recommend taking your pet there for something simple like getting shots updated or something very minor.  I want a vet who is going to get to know my pets and treat them more like a patient.  I won't be going back there."""
"2,""Pesto's rocks the kazbah! It is a hot little spot in an armpit of a strip mall.  The wine bar is movin' and shakin' almost every night of the week.

What is not to like about this establishment....well, the food is just okay. Hey, its' Chandler. Wadda ya want?

"2,""After going to see Eat, Pray, Love, of course there was nothing I was craving more than authentic Italian food!!! I've been here before for lunch and dinner, so Pestos was the first place that popped into my head. This place apparently has been around for YEARS and I'm not surprised-their food is amazing! I ended up getting take-out rather than braving the bar solo (there's also a separate dining area) and ordered the linguini with white clam sauce (it was to die for!), mozzarella sticks with marinara, olives (not a huge fan of the sesame bread that comes with it), and OF COURSE a cannoli for dessert! The linguini was perfectly done and the clam sauce was amazing with just the right amount of clams. The mozzarella sticks were so-so, nothing special about them that I was thinking I should have gotten the stuffed mushrooms instead...these I KNOW are worth it...oh well, next time. The olives (an appetizer) were a delightful blend of 4 or so different types and it definitely hit the spot-I love olives!! They come with sesame bread, which I'm not really a fan of but I was craving carbs so I smothered some butter on it and was over it pretty fast. Now, I have NEVER had a cannoli as delicious as the ones I've gotten from Pesto's! Ever. These are absolutely melt-in-your-mouth amazing! From the chocolate chips inside to the crushed pistaccios outside sprinkled with a little powdered sugar and a fresh, crispy shell, your mouth will thank you!! Everyone that works here is absolutely amazing! It's a family business and their pride of ownership shows in everything they do. I've NEVER had bad service here and even when they're over-run with the high schoolers (note to self: don't go during Seton's lunch hour), their service has always been top-notch! I highly recommend checking them out-even if it is just for an amazing cannoli! =)"""

"1,""If you want to be yelled out and called a liar, go to RSVP realty.  A few months into a rental agreement, the A/C went out during a heat wave in August.  RSVP told us to stay in a hotel and they would reimburse us for up to $75.  A few weeks after we submitted our receipts for two days, we received a letter stating that the tenants were responsible for the motor breaking and attached the $700 bill!  And the hotel would not be covered.  When my roommate and I spoke to RSVP, we were told that we were to blame because the filter was not replaced.  We communicated that the filter was replaced last month and he told us we were lying.   He not only backed out on his commitment to fix the repair and reimburse us for the hotel, but blamed us for the old air conditioner going out on a hot AZ summer day.  I am not only completely appalled by the shady company, but appalled by the lack of professionalism in yelling at us calling us liars and that the landlord wants to evict us.    When talking to the owner of the home, she profusely apologized for RSVPs unprofessional behavior and lies.   I will never use RSVP realty for ANY business and will share this story with people."""

Last time I was there, there was this crazy old witch there and she was so rude and made a big deal about adjusting my glasses. She said she had to charge me $15 to adjust my sunglasses because they weren't purchased there. WHAT?!?! I've been taking all of my glasses there for repairs and never had any problems with free fitting. When they replaced the nose pads, the staff always adjust to make sure they fit properly. The guy that worked on my glasses told me to wear for a day and see how they fit and bring back for readjustment if needed. This crazy lady (I believe she's the owner) tried to charge me a fee.

Never a great selection, overpriced and I have been really disappointed with the beef I've gotten here.\n\nHope they can stay in business but I actually drive a bit out of my way to hit the Fry's as they have a better selection of produce and meat. Not great but better for sure. I go here now only if I'm in dire need of some staple item and am too lazy to drive the extra few miles."""
"2,""best Mediterranean food in the valley,  love the open kitchen layout, it makes for a great show on a Friday or Saturday night, the live jazz on Thursdays and Saturdays makes it worth the trip from central phoenix for me.  i got hooked at the location in Tempe when i was going to school, Samir was running it then( one of the greatest chefs in the southwest) they still use many of his recipes and maintain his style.  they have a few locations all over the valley. Chandler, with the pond, the patio, and the interior layout w/ live music this is with out a doubt their best location, ask your server for the details on the dishes it will make your decision a lot easier, great wine list too and again allow your server to guide you in the right direction.  healthy fresh food, great prices, great service, creative atmosphere."""
"1,""\""""Let's meet at the Chandler Pita Jungle!\"""" texts fiddle r dee. \""""What's it near? Like the mall proper?\"""" I text back. \""""Dobson and Ray!\"""" she exclaims (she's easily excitable it's pretty cute the first hundred thousand times but after that it's like wha'ev's :p) \""""What the hell!?! That's not near the mall!!!\"""" I shout in my mind. I had no idea that there was anything else in Chandler besides that obnoxious mall, an In-n-Out Burger, and were all the house wives whose husbands aren't wealthy enough to give them houses in Scottsdale lived. I couldn't believe it. Amazing. \n\nSo I park the chrome trimmed tank and burst through the doors looking for the fiddle r and a bunch of friggin' ducks that she has been eyeballing for lunch. She urged me several times in class via text to hurry because raw duck gives her indigestion and she didn't think the proprietors would look favorably upon her preparing her own lunch on the patio (unlike the Monastery). She was ravenous and there's a fierceness that comes out when she gets that way. It would be scary if it didn't makes me giggle. Anywhodunnit, yah, a friggin' patio and with friggin' ducks! I love friggin' ducks! Oh yah, around noon this place is filled with soccer moms mostly minus their spawn but a couple of the moms stole them away from their nannies long enough to show the brats off to the other soccer moms. I imagine the conversations go a little like this, \""""Look how much more better and how much more pretty my baby, I forget its name, is than your baby that you forgot its name is.\"""" \""""oh yah, but at least my husband, I forget his name, bought me better tits than your husband, you forget his name, did.\"""" and then they go runnin' for the shelter of their mothers' little helper... I think this is why I wasn't really noticed when I first walked in and asked about the ducks I look nothing like these people, my soul had not been crushed by the fact that I sold my dreams for a cookie cutter cardboard existence (mostly because I sold my soul in 4th grade, a long time ago).\n\nI finally found fiddle r at her table on the patio and exchanged glares I sat to wait another ten minutes until someone asked us if we needed help. Luckily for the staff the conversation was fairly good otherwise the fork that Ms. fiddle r was fiddling (she's an amazing fiddler) with would have ended up in someone's temple a couple of times.\n\nWhen we finally received a bit of wait attention nothing on the menu jumped out at me. I was thinking lamb or pork gyro. Sad face for Howard, beef gyro for me. Fiddle r ordered the Lavosh Shwarma wrap that read like it might be the good side of yummy but I didn't want to order the same thing because I wanted to be different.\n\nI've been to one other Pita Jungle (across from MCC in Mesa on Southern) three times in total but have never been overly impressed by them but seemed fairly competent. This one fell inline with it's sister store even with the strange beef in the gyro that I think they try to make look like lamb but in rectangular slices. WHERE IS THE FRIGGIN' LAMB!?! The exception as far as the food is concerned was the Blue Corn Nachos that fiddle r ordered for us. Someone in the kitchen dumped a bucket of goodness onto a plate and slathered it with cheesy gooey-ness! Yum! Fiddle r and I enjoyed it muchly as did the ducks. And actually ducks like a lot of things I wouldn't have thought like tomatoes, beans, beef, and chicken. I wished they served duck because that would have been hilarious.\n\nWhat made this place fun was not the food (2.25-2.5 stars - I changed my mind.) and definitely not the service we received (2 stars, I wasn't even asked if I wanted another beer) it was the shaded friggin' patio located on the edge of a man-made lake-ish type water feature and the friggin' ducks and as always the friggin' company."""
"2,""I would say that I prefer the Mesa location simply because it tends to be quieter but this one is within walking distance for me so it's often the one I go to.  Plus I like sitting out out by the lake when the temperature finally becomes reasonable.\n\nI was reading the previous reviews and a lot of people have had problems with the service but I've never had anything but wonderful service here.  I've eaten here during busy and slow times and the service has always been pretty consistant.  The food is excellent and, I think, appropriately priced.  I love going to a restaurant where a good chunk of the food is vegetarian because that is so rare.   I especially love their Gazpacho, Roasted Red Pepper Hummus and Spinach Cheese Lavosh thing on their app menu.  I do eat fish occasionally so my only sadness is that they stopped carrying the Tuna Melt Pizza which was to die for.  Maybe they'll bring it back someday.......can you hear me Pita Jungle?"""
"1,""Walked in to the sight of the hostess and all the wait staff texting on their phones. Bartender said we could seat ourselves. Waited for about 15 minutes- didn't even get waters. There was more staff on hand than patrons, so there was no reason for any kind of wait. Poor service, total lack of professionalism... Went to the Mexican grill next door and had drinks in less than 3 minutes. I suggest going there instead!"""
"2,""Customer service is always an A+! My husband and I come in a lot! They have our drink order down as well as our food order!! Super friendly and they always cater to our needs! We love this pita jungle!!"""
"2,""The salads here are absolutely delicious and there is so many choices to choose from! The service was so nice and I enjoyed that the hosts and servers were all wearing their normal attire. The building was so unique and I loved the decor in the place. \n\nI got the Greek Salad, I highly recommend it!"""
"1,""This place is located conveniently close to me, so I had to stop by for a weekend breakfast. The decor is classic 50s diner, so I really  wanted to like this place but I came away disappointed. The service was fine, the food looked delicious, but ultimately everything I tried was bland and forgettable.\n\nSometimes I am hesitant to trust my first impression of a restaurant's food... as if my taste buds might be having an off day. However, I went with a friend who is potentially the world expert on biscuits & gravy. Absolutely every breakfast joint he dines at, he samples their biscuits and gravy (in addition to the regular breakfast). Biscuits + white sausage gravy should = delicous. Not here. It must've been made from a mix.\n\nSorry to say I didn't enjoy my dining experience here. The food filled the void but had no flavor."""
"2,""I had a BBQ Beef Sandwich at Chase's Diner today. Good food as well as good fries. This is one of those 50's style diners that's fun to eat at. I also like the sign I read when eating there that stated,\nAll Unattended Children Will Be Given an Espresso and a New Puppy. \nHilarious."""
"2,""Went here for a quick weekday breakfast while running errands.  \nStaff= friendly. \nService= quick & pleasant. \nFood= better than expected. French Dip, Standard Cheeseburger and Green Chile cheeseburger all delivered.  \nPlace could use an update and even a good cleaning on the windows and walls but it wasn't gross or anything."""
"1,""If I could give a zero stars, I would.  Got Meatloaf dinner and Chicken Fried Steak tonight.  One piece of the meatloaf was literally burned black on one side and had the stripes from the grille.  The Chicken Fried Steak was hard as a rock.  The coating was like a dead carcass and it just peeled off the meat in one piece.  The meat inside could not have been chewed by a dinosaur!  I don't recommend Chase's to anyone who wants quality food.  They need some new people in their kitchen.  The owner was very nice, however, and offered us a free meal.  Which we declined.  We had this happen to us once a while back and swore we wouldn't go back that time.  This time........never again no matter how much free food they offered!"""
"2,""The staff here and the PTs are excellent! I have been seeing them since 2009 and this year, despite multiple injuries and a very rigorous training schedule, they managed to keep me healthy enough to complete an Ironman race. They are wonderful for injury management and prevention and for rehab after surgery or other injury. I absolutely love this place and they are truly a part of my regular training and fitness to keep me in top competition shape."""
"1,""This place is a disaster. Stopped for lunch right at noon. The entire staff was in the back while the line kept building. Five minutes before anyone came out. The food was mediocre and the staff was very disorganized. Appeared to me that some definite training is in order."""
"1,""This location really gives bagel places a bad name. \n\n\nI don't know why I continue to keep trying and going back to this establishment. Probably because it is right across the street from work.\n\nNo matter what I order a bagel with cream cheese or a egg and cheese on a bagel it just takes forever.\n\nThis morning I literally walked out when I was online. They had about 6 people waiting to order for over 10 minutes!\n\nSecondly, I don't love their food that takes 6 hours to make. that is being handled by ex cons working there and people who do not care about their \n\nI am not going back.

"1,""My family and I ate here for our grandfathers birthday. Figured we could try it since he loves steakhouses. We made a reservation but it really wasn't needed...this place was not busy at all, especially for 630pm on a Saturday night. \nFirst we got off on the wrong foot because we asked to be seated at a larger table (6 people and 1 baby). The hostess said no because they save it for large groups (it had 8 chairs). \nOk everything was fine after but the food took forever! The margarita I ordered was poorly made. We did accidentally spilt a glass of water and they brought napkins promptly. But after cleaning up the water with the white napkin I realized the table was discustingly dirty...like black dirty. \n\nThe food was not that bad but the chicken from the kids meal kind of tasted like there was a hint of metal. Yeah it was gross...like McDonald's chicken is better.\n\nProbably won't return. Even with a good coupon this place was not worth it. \n\nCmon black Angus step it up!"""
"2,""The molasses bread here is to die for as well a the fried zucchini.  While the happy hour selection is limited, the dishes are great!"""
"1,""I don't think my fianc\u00e9 or I will ever return to a Black Angus. We don't go out often...so when we want to do something special on the weekends we want to skip the dishes end enjoy some fine cuisine and have a pleasurable evening together. However...our last experience was anything but.\n\nWe went to the Black Angus located in Chandler, Arizona on March 8th (so 2 and a half weeks ago from this point). It It seemed like a normal enough place and we were shown to our table. One of the first things we noticed, and my fianc\u00e9 asked about, was if the place used to be an IHOP...as the tables seemed to have that kind of quality to them.\n\nOur waitress Emily arrived, gave us our menus, and asked us what we'd like to drink. As we usually do we ordered lemonades. Emily said that they had strawberry-raspberry lemonades and, thinking this was just a flavor, we said sure. She promptly returned with our lemonades and, I will admit, we were pleasantly surprised. We just expected it to be a reddish colored drink but this had real fruit in it. So being as thirsty as I was (there was no water on the table up to this point) I downed mine in a quick fashion and asked for a refill. She then said she'd bring me back a water with the lemonade because they were $2.99 a refill. We were shocked. We just wanted lemonade period. We didn't know we'd ordered SPECIAL lemonades that were three dollar a drink. We reluctantly allowed her to get another one because we didn't know if there were any NORMAL lemonades at this point...since, after all, that's what we thought we asked for. We looked at the menu, which to me was horribly overpriced, and I asked my fianc\u00e9 if she was SURE this is where we wanted to eat. Since she was just trying to go with the flow of it she said it'd be fine and that it wasn't a big deal. If only...\n\nWe ordered the 2 for $54 meal deal that offered an appetizer, 2 sides per meal, and then the entree per each person. We got our sampler and were not impressed. It was okay but I've had the same kind of thing at Applebee's and other restaurants.\n\nWhen we finally got our meals...well...that's when things started to go from bad to worse. One of the things I noticed when I ordered my meal, which was a disappointment, was that the biggest sized steak available in this meal deal was a 12 oz new york or ribeye. Not what I'd call large by any means. When I looked at my steak, and began to cut it up, I managed to trim off about 20% of it in fat alone, and the portions of the sides were on the small side. My fianc\u00e9's meal was not much better. The grated parmesan looked and tasted odd and somehow, to her utter amazement, they managed to screw up the green beans somehow. Even two weeks later, when we mention all this to people, she still can't understand how someone can fail to cook green beans in such a way that they taste horrible. The food, overall, was of average quality and not what we'd expect from a place like Black Angus.\n\nOur waitress made a guest appearance once or twice (with the second time being to deliver the slice of cheesecake to top off our meal) so we were left wondering half the time if we had a waitress at all.\n\nFinally we elected to tip the waitress 15% of our bill since some of the problems were not hers and we didn't want her to have a bad evening which might boil over into someone else's bad meal experience. This took our total bill of $68.70 up to a bit over $79. \n\nWe were not thrilled with our visit to the establishment, as you can see. So we decided we'd go home and leave a comment on the website listed at the bottom of the receipt, like most restaurants have. When I put in the website I was confused: why is it asking what my opinions are on various combo ideas when I had a bad experience. I discovered this was the entire purpose of the website. I had to actually go to the Black Angus website and merely leave a comment.\n\nAt this point we were fairly content to leave it at that, now that we gave some feedback, but the manager of the restaurant, Matt, decided to contact us to discuss what happened and see what he could do to make it right. I told him I didn't believe it was his or Emily's fault about the prices, as they are decided by someone higher up in the food chain (no pun intended), but it would have been nice to have been informed about the refill price on these special lemonades, larger portion sizes, and for the staff to be a bit more attentive (it's odd having to share a water at a place where it averages $30 a person). I always believe in second chances but my fianc\u00e8 was a bit harder to convince I succeeded, as Matt offered to send us a gift card. \n\nOver a week passed by and nothing showed up in the mail. I actually had to contact Matt to find out what was going on and if one was sent at all. He said he'd forgotten it in his car but it would show up soon. Okay...that's fine. Things happen. Then it showed up today. A $20 gift card. We found it insulting. I don't know what we expected but not this."""
"2,""I have frequented this place quite a few times, and its okay.  The things I like about it are the late hours, \""""free\"""" internet as long as you buy a drink and the indoor and outdoor seating.\n\nWhat I don't like is how they now regulate the internet.  When you purchase a drink, they give you a reciept for only 3 hours worth of internet service.  It's not that I personally need more then 3 hours of service at one time, but why regulate the Wifi?  Maybe its to stop people from camping out and hogging up space or something, I'm not sure.\n\nThe staff has always been nice to me, but I'm only there on average about once a month at best, and its usually to take advantage of thier late hours."""
"1,""I've been to CR a few times now since I like to venture out of my usual latte spots... usually a decent experience... This time, however, I had several disappointments that altered how I perceive this place (and ultimately alter my desire to come back again).  \n\nThis particular evening, my sister and I arrived and, though we weren't planning on staying and hanging out (I just wanted a latte), after what we experienced, we decided to leave quickly.  \n\nThe place has a nice, local hang-out feel to it - lots of random people, in groups, or on laptops, just chillin' enjoying their drinks.. the staff was friendly and all, too.  When I went to order my latte, I had a few questions on steam temperature for my milk (I'm slightly picky about that) and he kindly answered them and executed my shots as requested.  As I was paying (cash, since they only allow debit/CC cards at a minimum of I think $5), he asked if we were going to stay there for the evening or just to-go.. me, total optimist, thinking he is going to offer us the wifi password or even a sample of something or just plain being friendly and talkative, was surprised when he said \""""yeah, because you have an outside drink and we don't allow those, so you'd have to leave\"""" adding a fake sorry face... my sister, next to me, holding her Starbucks water container filled with WATER... I'm thinking \""""really??? are you serious??\"""" I was super surprised at that statement and frankly, really annoyed.  I just bought a product and am being told that because she has a Starbucks CUP (not even a Starbucks coffee), she has to leave.  WTF!\nYou can tell that totally did not sit well with me.  We kindly said we'd leave as we were going to go shopping anyway... \n\nTHEN, as I go to shake the nutmeg and the cinnamon in to my latte (this is how I fake myself out that my latte is sweet without the extra sugar), I shake and shake and the flippin' spices come mixed with SUGAR - both nutmeg AND cinnamon... what's the point?  There were already 3 different kinds of sweeteners there on the shelf for ppl to add as they please, why do they have to add sugar to the cinnamon and nutmeg shakers?.. I found that annoying and definitely a con to getting lattes at this place.\n\nall in all, I'm not sure I'll come back soon.. maybe not for a while.. or ever.  Sorry, but I've experienced better."""
"2,""I am addicted to coffee. I know, it's a problem! :D Buuut I wouldn't say I'm an expert. So excuse my own way of describing what I like and don't like. \n\nThe coffee here is the perfect \""""strongness\"""". The taste is perfect for me, strong enough without being bitter and gross. They have a great variety of espresso drinks like mochas, black and whites, mint, etc. All really good. The baristas have quite the showmanship. They are quick, precise, and do some cool tricks as well! \n\nThe atmosphere is okay. Fine to study but not exactly cozy to hang out. There is free wifi which is a plus."""

"1,""Ok so I guess I'm the odd one out here. The service was great the happy hour deal with imported beers for $2.50 was excellent but the food was just average. Well the chips were ok with the salsas, beans and sour cream but both of our meais were disappointing. It almost tasted like the food was premade and then heated up though I wouldn't accuse them of this it just sort of tasted that way. I had the veggie combo - the chile releno was mostly breading and kind of bland, the enchilada was decent but nothing that made it stand out and the taco was almost all lettuce with some beans but not much flavor.  They do charge for extra chips but to me for two people that's not a big deal since the portions are more than enough with one basket of chips. I will give it a second shot since everyone here says it's very good."""
"1,""Since this place is close to home and I love Mexican food, I've tried very hard to like Si Senor's over the years.  Still \""""not feeling it.\"""". The service is always good, ditto for the chips and salsa but the entrees fall short on taste. I know New Mexican style food and this isnt it."""

"2,""I come here for one thing...\n\n\nThe grilled chicken chimichangas with the red sauce on the side so i can use it for dipping.  I cannot tell you what is all in it but the grilled chicken alone is fantastic. Do i love the price for all of this...I guess.  Its not a stellar deal or anything but its like a once a month or every other month thing for me.  I love that the place gives you chips and salsa before your meal but i usually like to wait for my actual meal so i am not absurdly full from stuffing my face before hand.  \nBelieve me Chimichangas are not good later on so you have to have an appetite on you for sure.\n\nHorchata is okay. Not my favorite either seems too watery in my opinion, I love it when horchata is more on the creamy slightly sweeter side rather than watery and kind of sweet.  One guy that works here knows my friend who is hooked to this place and got me started so when we walk through he already knows.  The girl who cannot do her makeup for the life of her on the other hand is a different story."""
"1,""Lets face it, no one wants to write a review about her vagina getting checked (TMI anyone?) but as women we need to find places we can rely and trust for all our Gyno needs. This is just my small contribution to it.\n\nI was in a situation where I needed to see a specialist and I didn't know of any in the area. My coworker quickly recommended New Horizon's because they have tons of offices in the valley and there would likely be one close to me (or work). They were the only place that also agreed to perform the test I needed without first doing a regular consultation (I had already seen a doctor and just needed a follow up test).  I arrived 30mins before my appointment time so I could fill out paperwork and do all the homework prior to seeing the Dr.\n\nThe office is very large and quite pretty with lots of chairs, TVs and magazines. That's really the only positive. I filled out a bible's worth of paperwork (more than any other place) and gave them my ID/insurance card to check and photocopy. When I went to the bathroom I saw a sign that I needed to give a urine test for my procedure... as I am sitting on the toilet. WTF? Why would they not tell me this when I booked the appointment? Or when they gave me the 2-day reminder? Or maybe even when I checked in and told them what I was there for?. I quickly lifted up my pants and ran to the desk to try and convince them to let me give my urine sample right away, before I exploded.\n\nI gave my sample but was really grossed out that they gave me a coffee-looking paper cup. Below those cups they actually had the plastic sample containers with a lid, but they insisted I use the regular paper (NO LID) cup and put it in the deposit box. Gross, I really hope that nurse doesn't tip it over and drop it accidentally. After all that mess, it was time for my appointment but I was still waiting outside, holding my pager like a customer at Outback Stakehouse. They didn't take me in until 30-40mins later, and that was just with the nurse telling me what was going to happen. I waited in the consultation room, got moved to a second consultation room and then waited some more for the doctor. When he finally arrived, the procedure literally took 2 mins and I was out the door by then. Not sure why I had to wait 1.5hrs for that but oh well.\n\nI didn't feel like the office was very organized or patient-focused. It bothered me that all consultation rooms had flat screen TVs with drug advertisements, to try and entice you to ask your doctor about that. It gives me the impression that they are in the business of selling unnecessary medication and ad space rather than patient care. No, I don't wan to discus how I can gulf down a bunch of pills so that my period smells like flowers and unicorns. I just want to be healthy.\n\nWait.. is that too much to ask?"""

This last time, the young man that helped me looked surly.  Like he didn't like me and I'm his costumer!  He showed me a gas stove to be used for hot pot, it was the last one and the case was broken.  He glossed over this fact hoping I wouldn't notice.  When I pointed out to him the case was broken, he very unkindly told me that may be the case but nothing is wrong with the gas stove itself.\n*Sigh* I'll probably still shop here as there are not very many options for Asian grocery stores here in Phoenix but I won't be walking in and out of there with a smile like I used to!"""

"1,""Sad!! The talent and creativity of their sushi chefs is unfortunately trumped by the horrific customer service due to lousy wait staff. The rolls here are creative, fresh, funky (sometimes too funky, i've had a weird choice or two that i would not choose again) and overall pretty good. But if their paying customers continue to be neglected during their visits they will inevitably fall due to low scoring reviews. My review score is based solely on the horrible service provided by their waitress last week."""
"1,""I always like to try new restaurant. After reading Yelp with some mixed reviews, I went on and bought a Groupon $25 for $50 deal and thought it was a good deal. It was my bf and I first time at Ninja's. The place was empty, we were greeted by a very sweet waitress. The first thing I noticed was the chefs. I thought, well it's ok, not all Sushi restaurants have to have Japanese chefs to make it good. Does that make me a Sushi snob? : / The first thing our waitress ask if we have a Groupon. Why? Does that matter, I thought. I said yes and she gave us the menu. We look at it but nothing sounds appetizing. Is it a different menu cause we have a Groupon? We decided to order a lot just in case... I think I've ordered about 10 rolls, sushi, and sashimi, But when our food arrived, it didn't seem enough. Our waiter didn't tell us what was on the first plate. Then the second round, he just drop it off on our table and we have no idea what we'd got. The rolls were just medico, nothing fancy or tasty. I thought they were all bland. Felt like the foods were made from Sushi 101 cookbook. My bf loves sushi and can sit forever eating them, but by the third plate, he said he was done and wanted to get the rest home. I was very surprised when the bill came, it was over $100 without drinks. I gave our waiter our Groupon and it came down to $65. I felt like we were gypped cause I don't think we recieved all the food we've ordered. I look at the order sheet and some wasn't cross off. And we weren't even stuffed ( it doesn't take a lot for me ) Also, we have very little leftover. I would have check with our waiter but my bf didn't care for the rest of the food. He didn't enjoy them anyway. So when I thought about it all, I spent way more than I wanted too, just to try a new place and leftover I don't think neither of us would eat again. This is one reason why my bf don't like to sway away from our favorite place. With that, the amount  we spent we could have gone to our favorite place twice, that's what he said! :)\nNeedless to say, I won't be coming back. But if you're not a sushi snob and for $20 all you can eat sushi, this place might be for you."""
"2,""This place is too popular on Sunday for breakfast.. Which is coincidentally when I like to go too. We normally wait in line for a half hour but I think its worth it. Good food. Decent prices."""
"2,""I just took my wife and daughter to Mimi's. If you like REAL New England clam chowder then look no further than this place. They only serve it (sniff) on Fridays. It is rich, creamy, and full of big chunks of fresh clams. Couple that with a full menu of great lunchtime or dinnertime treats and you'll come away satisfied. The service was impeccable. The staff was very friendly and they work together as a real team to give their patrons a truly memorable experience. Love it love it love it! The muffins are great and when they found out my daughter hadn't been there before they gave her four muffins to take home with her absolutely gratis. I had the Cobb salad which never disappoints. My wife ordered off the two course special menu and got asparagus with citrus shrimp. My daughter had the salmon. Everyone raved about how good everything was. The food, the service, and the ambience is great. Two thumbs up...way up!"""
"2,""I had never been to Mimi's Cafe before I joined my networking group. (Chandler Networking Professionals every Tuesday at 12 just in case you were wondering). The staff here is very accommodating. The food is always hot and fresh. Lately I have been getting a chicken Caesar salad with blackened chicken. It also comes with a muffin of your choice. Other favorites menu items of mine are the BBLT and the Le burger de Madame. It's a bacon cheese burger with a fried egg.  Stop by if you're looking for a good lunch. Also if you're looking for a place to host an event or group meeting they have a huge secluded room that could accommodate you."""
"1,""Noticed a few reviews complaining about cold French onion soup so I brought that up with the Waiter he assured me it would be hot so I tried it off course it came out cold.  Didnt think the flavor was to good.  Ordered chicken salad  sandwich and it was whole wheet croissant. Why would some want a healthy croissant that makes no sense and why would the menu not explain that."""
"2,""As Jesse J. said we went here last night for some sushi after i had looked here on Yelp and man was it worth it. So far this is probably the best sushi I have had in Arizona.\n\nMy favorite roll was the big and spicy roll. The flavor was just amazing with the seared salmon and yellowtail(?) on top with the pickled jaleneno. The sauce on it was amazing as well this is one where no soy sauce is needed.\n\nAlso ordered a spicy tuna but asked him to go a little on the spicy side and he obliged and it was a nice fiery roll but not so much that the taste of the tuna got lost. It but some burning on my tounge but was amazing.\n\nThe rest of the meal was jut as good especially the tsunami roll which I can best describe as a vegas roll minus the cream cheese(i am no a fan of cream cheese in sushi) with it's own special sauce. The sauce was a great mix of hot and sweet where you got a bit of a kick but it was cooled quickly. Even people who don't do spice will like this.\n\nThe only things preventing this from being a 5 star place was that i never got the water i ordered and some of my miso soup was cold, i think the tofu had not been in long enough. A return visit is planned soon and could easily up this to 5 stars."""
"2,""The best sushi in Chandler. Possibly in the Phoenix metro area.\n\nShimogamo is a quiet sushi location in a strip mall.  The interior has just a few tables and is very peaceful.  Hurry is not the name of the game here"

"2,""I liked it here! The food was pretty great.\n\nI ordered the cucumber roll, veggie roll, and eel/cucumber roll. I love my cucumber, obviously! The rolls were a little small but they were tasty. I wish the rice had a little more seasoning, but it was definitely not bad at all!\n\nI also ordered  the sunomono salad, which had shredded crab meat in it as well as some seaweed. It was very yummy but maybe a little too much vinegar. No big deal!\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the shrimp tempura, calamari and chicken cutlet. He was not a fan of the calamari - it was a little tough and way spicy. That's okay - the rest of the food he said was delicious!\n\nOverall it was a little pricey for what we got ($56 for two people), but it was great. I'd recommend them to anyone in the area!"""

"1,""I'm not sure what happened to this place, but over the last 6 months it has taken several steps in the wrong direction. The quality of the food is the only reason this is a two start review, and not a one star. The service is getting slower every visit, and the pricing fluctuations are ridiculous. The once $.99 breakfast biscuits are now $2.99. Two hundred percent increase in less than 6 months!"""
"1,""Didn't care for it.  Expensive, small portions, and mediocre cooking.  Go a few blocks west to Saigon Pho if you want the real thing.  But this place is prettier, whatever that's worth to you."""
"1,""What the pho, man?!\n\nThe food is bland.  It tastes like they cater to the elderly.\n\nThe prices are high for the type of food you are getting.  Nobody should have to bay over $5.75 for ANY type of pho.  \n\nI've gone there 2x and I don't know if it's just me, but the hostess there just rubbed me the wrong way both times.  She was cracking jokes and making comments that were borderline inappropriate.  \n\nThey focus more on decor and trying to \""""entertain\"""" their patrons rather than focusing on what's really important... the food.\n\nYou want a really good, AUTHENTIC bowl of Pho?

It's not as ritzy and refined, but the pho and other menu items there are less expensive, tastes better, and they serve you much larger portions.  \n\nEat at Cyclo if you want to have a SEEMINGLY over-attentive hostess bothering you while you try to eat.

I went to a couple of other dentists in the area.  Dr. Johansen's office is head and shoulder above the others.    \n\nThe doctor's work was done quickly with minimum of pain.  The office is very well run.  The dental hygienists, and assistants are very competent.   Scheduling is easy and efficient.  A real person calls to confirm the appointment a day prior.  I really dislike when a machine calls.  \n\nA little about the office.   It is meticulously clean as a dentist office should be.  The equipment is seems to be first rate, clean and sanitary.  Everyone in the office is pleasant and efficient.  They understand how to work with insurance companies too.  \n\nTo my mind the perfect dentist would be one that could filter out that high pitched whine of the dental drill."""
"2,""This place is awesome.  I brought my 2007 Jeep Cherokee because my brakes were making a squeezing noise.  The owner said that I just need back brakes and my front brakes had another 15k miles on them.  I will not go to another place.  If I had brought my car to another shop, they would have told me to change the front brakes too."""
"1,""Although I agree with allot of other reviews about this place being clean, offering alternatives like rebuilt parts for repairs and so on, in the last 6 months their prices have gone up AT LEAST 10%, they no longer offer any coupons to returning customers, NOT even on oil changes and they've hired a lady for the front office.  So it seems that their success was gained at the cost to their customers.  I too have gotten quotes from them on services that I can find elsewhere for on average 15% less.  Lastly, the owner needs to stay AWAY from the customers.  I needed a ride to and from their shop about 6 months ago, which, by the way they advertise as a \""""free\"""" service. I LIVE LESS THAN 2 MILES AWAY FROM THE SHOP.  When I was at the desk paying for my repairs, he had to add, very sarcastically, that they had given me the FREE rides.  Maybe that's why they hired the woman for the front desk.  Personally, Jim was much more knowledgeable and a better CSR."""
"2,""I used to visit AJ's only for the sweets (Joseph Schmidt's truffles, gourmet chocolates, cheesecakes/bombes, Napoleons, cannolis, gourmet cookies) and the cheese department.

I've always wanted to try their hot foods, but it was only tonight's dinner that appealed to me- salmon with stuffed crab w/ a white cheese cream sauce.  Sides were an awesome scalloped potatoes w/ bacon and cream sauce and very dry-looking \""""honey- glazed\"""" carrots.  Thinking I'd have dinner elsewhere, I asked only to sample the potatoes, and they were so delicious!  Next time, plans be da*ned, if AJ's serving anything crab-stuffed and those scalloped potatoes, I'm definitely going to dine there!\n\nOther than for the specialty-food counters, you won't catch me shopping here... too expensive!

All their food is made fresh to order, and they will modify anything on the menu to meet your needs.  Their online ordering system is easy to use and allows you to save your favorite orders.   They also have a great salad bar and their soups are fantastic.  My favorite is their vegetarian French onion soup, served in a bowl with boiling hot provolone cheese,  yum!  You will leave stuffed to the max or with leftovers, but don't forget to grab a complimentary ice cream cone on your way out."""
"2,""Definitely a favorite Lunch spot! My friends and I eat here often. Yummy sandwiches, soup and salad- all for a really great price.

Their salad bar is a great option if you're not sure what you're in the mood for. Trying out the day's special is usually not a bad choice either. The only complaint I have is that I really like their pasta & meatballs except they no longer have spaghetti- only bow-ties and penne now. I hope they bring back spaghetti!!! \n\nEnjoy their complimentary mini muffins and end your meal w/ their free low-fat frozen yogurt!"""

"1,""I love Michaels as a brand.  I enjoy crafting, new hobbies, and everything Michaels is about... I could spend my life savings in there without much of a thought.  I worked at a Michaels for two years (mind you, my feelings of shopping at Michaels are independent from my feelings of working for them) so I'm intimately familiar with corporate standards and what the employees are up against.  This store FAILS.  \n\nCustomer service: I've rarely so much as been greeted by an employee here.  When I seek someone out, they act like it's an inconvenience for them to stop what they're doing and answer my question.. or God-forbid, walk with me to another section.  If a second cashier is called up for the always-way-too-long checkout lines, they too act like it's such an inconvenience.  I saw a woman with \""""assistant manager\"""" on her name tag walk right by me, standing in the back of a 10-person, impatient line, without stopping to help, calling for other help, saying a word to anybody, or even making eye-contact.  Ignoring us doesn't make us go away.  \n\nStore cleanliness: There are consistently shipping boxes from incoming merchandise, overstock boxes, and extra product stacked in the aisles.  The same boxes stacked on top of the aisles is more out of the way, but still tacky.  Every retail store has to deal with customers putting things down in the wrong spot, even the wrong department, and routinely go through putting things back... that doesn't happen here, at least not often.  \n\nFraming department: I had a poster that I am VERY fond of framed here.  Again, working at Michaels I was trained in the framing department, so I know their standards.  To start, the frame samples are kept behind a counter, so I expected the associate to help me identify which ones I wanted to see.  She would bring out only the ones I specified, one at a time, as I asked for them... no advice, suggested alternatives if one didn't work, or opinions in any way.  No price guidance, no aesthetic guidance, no questions about what I was looking for, not even a trace of up-selling, and frankly no help.  I made my decisions somehow, and left it for the 10 days it would take.  When I came to pick it up, there was some of the poster \""""fine print\"""" (copyright info I think) half visible, half cut off by the frame.  When I asked about it, they said they had been trying to center the print, and that's how it had to be.  No, no...first of all, it still wasn't centered, so that's no excuse.  Secondly, that's a big problem, not collateral damage they should have been ok with.  Shouldn't they strive for perfection when I'm paying a lot of money for professional framing?  They agreed to re-frame it (another week) and it was positioned correctly the next time.  The last problem was evident after I got it home.  The poster, which was purchased rolled up, had small creases in it over the entire surface from having been rolled so long.  In my frame shop, it wasn't even questioned if a poster would be dry-mounted, it just was.  That would have smoothed out the poster since it is essentially adhering the poster to a piece of foam-board.  If they didn't want to include that automatically, fine, but they should have offered.  These framing \""""experts\"""" should have known what would happen without it and suggested a solution.  I'd have paid extra to have it done, I obviously was willing to pay to have the whole project done well.  These framers didn't take my project seriously"

"1,""Bad day? I don't know. I've had better meals at other Red Lobster restaurants. The only good thing about tonight's experience was the waiter, Bryan. Fast, efficient, polite and funny, just how I like it. We had a Lobsterita (huge margarita) and shared it. Regretted it too, since it was way too sour and had a chemical taste to it. I couldn't take but two sips and then I switched to something else that I knew it'll taste much better, water. The salads were made with wilted lettuce and sore looking tomatoes. Croutons were ok. The all too familiar hot bread was good, as it is always. The main dish, a medium cooked steak and grilled shrimp was delivered on time. Steak was chewy at best, although the marinade's taste was ok. Shrimp were grilled well, not too much or too little. My wife's shrimp scampi was absolutely tasteless, overcooked shrimp in some sort of shrimp juice, with very little butter and no garlic. Pretty horrifying if you ask me.\n\nI think this is the last visit we're going to pay to this location.

Terrible decision.  After complaining to the manager and driver, found out it is the owner of this and 5 other Pizza Huts around Tempe/Chandler that has added this extra fee.  We now order from a distant pizza hut under different ownership and pay the driver a nice tip to avoid this Ray Road business.  What's next, a fee for the box?"""
"1,""We ate at Carrabba's in Chandler last night. It was okay, but I have had better. The service left a lot to be desired. The server was pleasant enough, but neglected to advise me that they do not have green peppers to put on my pizza. The entire table heard me, so when my pizza came out it was covered with pepperocini. I sent it back, and they remade it, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended). One can get much better pizza and service at Nello's a few miles away, or Humble Pie. It will be a long time before I go to Carrabba's again."""
"2,""been here dozen's of times, finally decided to review them. The food is a step above the average Italian restaurant and the Sangria blow's away any other we've tried and we've tried quite a few. The mood is good and the manager, John, makes sure you are properly taken care of from service to food quality. Try the John Cole for a tasty dessert after stuffing yourself"""
"2,""Our favorite waitress is back! As is the old manager (John, I think?). They must have had an off night with a new manager subbing and it went dreadfully wrong. We decided to try it again after they introduced a reward program and were pleasantly surprised. \n\nI had one great meal (same items as last time), went back a couple of weeks later and tried something different (the Italian Classics). Delicious! However, I tried it again the following week and was disappointed. The chicken parmesan was burned. Like dark brown, bubbled cheese and the lasagna was unruly and tasted like it had cream cheese in it or something this time? It just kind of stayed on your tongue too long after taking a bite and was strangely creamy. Weird. \n\nSo I'll just stick with the calamari, sausage lentil soup and sirloin marsala. \n\nI guess I update my review to say when they are on their game, everything is fantastic, but they can really have off nights occasionally. I guess like many places."""

"2,""I hadn't been to this location in a long time and ended up wondering why  I don't come here more often. Probably the calories but the food was really good! I had the buffalo chicken strips and ordered a side of mashed potatos. Made my own meal! My daughter had the louisianna chicken pasta and it was really good. I love their white chocolate raspberry swirl cheesecake. They also have the best blue cheese dressing I have ever had and they do sell it to go. I usually pick one up once in a while and use it on salads and veggies. They do have a new \""""skinny\"""" menu with reduced calorie items but it is just so hard to pass up the other really good menu items! The menu can be a little overwhelming but is well organized once you figure it out!"""
"2,""I went with a large group of people on a Friday night.  They don't take reservations, so it took us about an hour to be seated.  Service was prompt, but the waitress had so many tables it took about 45 minutes for the food to come after ordering.  Some of us wanted desert, so that took an extra 45 minutes.  The place is packed with lines coming out the door most of the time.  Personally, I think the food is good, but not good enough to wait for.  I also think prices are pretty high.  Two alcoholic beverages, a main course, and a desert is about 50 bucks a person."""
"1,""I visited this location a couple of weekends ago. I was alone and just wanted to have lunch before I went to see a movie. I was seated in a section that was pretty much empty. I was placed in a corner and no server over to my table for 10 minutes. I even went so far as to make eye contact with a server and wave at her and she just looked away. I got up and went to the hostess station and told them that I wasn't going to wait ten minutes for someone to acknowledge me and that I would be taking my business elsewhere. I am a former server, bartender and host and I feel like this is unacceptable for the staff to flat out ignore someone."""

"1,""I go to this location ALOT and yesterday I did not have a good experience. Grabbed a couple books and tried to find a table to sit in the cafe, but no seating area open at the moment. So I sat on a book aisle. About 20 mins later, a staff came by and told me I couldn't sit on the aisle. I told her the reason I sat on the floor was because there was no seating. Would I really want to sit on the floor unless I had to???? I didn't catch the lady's name, but she was an older lady. Must be having a bad day or something. But I ALWAYS sit on the floor when there are no seating and no one has ever told me to move. She walked over to the cafe and try to direct me over and pointed to a couple open tables. It was sort of rude, so I dropped off the books that I planned to purchase and left the store. I saw a bunch of people in each aisle standing and reading and she didn't seem to have a problem with that. I rate this location with 1 star due to the staff being rude."""
"1,""Not my favorite place. I went today to get added RAM for my MAC computer. I was unable to purchase this at the apple store due the fact that apple only carries current stuff in their store bc space is limited.

"1,""I would not come here again for anything. Everything is over priced... Really this is Just a Showroom for Amazon."""
"1,""What a mess. This place USED to be so good on customer service. But now it is like they don't even care. My wife wanted to see the new Kindle Fire. They were working on the display. A worker grabbed one to show my wife. This old shrew of a woman yelled NOOO!!! and took it back. Like my wife seeing it for 30 seconds was some security breach. Added to this we found out they don't offer loaner phones when you are getting your phone worked on. They are also adding deductibles back to their plans. So basically there is no reason to go there over your local Verizon. The place is just a mess and the employees are apathetic. They won't answer questions. They don't get trained anyway. I for see them being out of operation within 5 years!"""
"1,""Seriously, I have always loved Kona Grill. I think the problem is not with all the Kona locations but just this one at the Chandler mall. We sat on the patio for happy hour and we could find very little happy. \n\nI have never been a server, as I know if I tried, it would be an epic fail. I really appreciate what they do and the good ones make it look so easy, even though I know it is a very demanding job. This night we were continually ignored to the point of given the finger several times. NO, not the middle one, the I will be right with you finger. When we did get the attention of our server, he seemed irritated he had to wait on us. \n\nI understand at happy hour they get busy but message to the management, hire more servers. People are desperately looking for jobs and what do you pay them, like $2.30 an hour? \n\nThe good news was the food was fresh and arrived quickly (they had expediters). I am happy to report the kitchen staff seems to have their act together."""
"2,""I came here and we choose to sit outside, that isn't really outside since it is covered next to the mall entrance. Service was nice and everything I had to eat was very nice, and I had the pot-stickers and shrimp and salmon sushi rolls. The shrimp tempura was the nights personal favorite. The right amount of rice and flavor for what you pay for - nothing experimental or crazy. \n\nOutside has a nice feel, but is louder and doesn't invite for any easy conversation. Inside it is quieter and they have nice tall stuffed seating arrangements, that I did not make use out of this time. Overall it has a nice vibe, even if I perceive it as a little manufactured. \n\nI am having some issues defining this place, are they trying to sell an upscale experience and yet call themselves a grill? Focusing on seafood but having almost anything else on the menu. Yeah, it is a little too eclectic for me - but then again both service and food is good, and I will come here again so I guess the undefinition joke is on me."""
"2,""Really good.  Garret was our server, late nite b4 a movie this place really hit the spot.  Our server was on point.  Kitchen was solid.  This definitely is our new late nite spot.  Comfy chairs too!"""
"1,""So this is the second and last time I'll be having dinner at Kona Grill. First time I had a pulled pork sandwich which was decent but not very exciting.  I enjoyed the chicken satay appetizer and the nice drink/wine list,  along with the modern,  relaxed atmosphere.  Really like sitting on the patio or in the bar area.  However,  the main dishes are mediocre at best. I always give places a second shot but our second visit was even more underwhelming.  I had the sea bass and my husband had the pork tenderloin.  Both were prepared well but pretty much tasteless and boring.  And expensive.  I love good food and I'll pay for anything worth it,  however this sea bass was not a $26 dish.  Not on any planet.  I'd recommend this as a nice place to meet for drinks and maybe apps and desserts but do not bother with an entree. I can name at least 10 other places in the valley with better food for those prices."""

No, it's not gourmet Chinese, but it's tasty enough.\n\nBut then we come to the weakness of this location: The menu.\n\nThe selection is really, really slim. To the point they don't even have sweet and sour chicken, for crying out loud. I'm used to Panda Express locations varying in their options (Potato Chicken and String-Bean Chicken are always hard to come by), but this one really takes the cake as far as limited selection goes."""
"1,""Did i really just pay 13.29 for this pathetic sandwich? the \""""prime rib dip\"""" looked so good on the menu, but what showed up at my table was a weak, dried up little sandwich, with no flavor, chewy overcooked meat, and served on what was nothing more than a tiny, hard oversized breadstick.\n\nour waitress annie, while pleasant enough, seemed unconcerned with the fact that i only took one bite out of this sandwich before pushing it aside, and DID NOT want a to go container. i dine out a lot, and this was possibly the worst most overpriced thing i've been served in a long time.\n\nThe \""""game day nachos\"""" were almost equally sad. at 8.99 they came with just a handful of chips and the same gross \""""cheez-whiz\"""" style sauce you squirt on your nachos at the local 7-11. disgusting\n\nthe rest of my party seemed ok with their burgers, even though my son ate less than half of his, and also did not want a to go container.\n\nat $65 for 3 people ($78 with tip) this was a completely dissatisfying and overpriced meal."""
"1,""While the quality of the food is good, the priority of the kitchen really makes you wonder at how they even function at times.

How complicated is that, seriously? The person taking the orders needs to focus on just that and not try to help the bus staff. \n\nThis was disappointing to say the least and perhaps was an isolated incident.

Ate here on a Friday night, waited about 10 minutes to be seated and had ordered off the gluten free menu shortly after. I choose the three ground beef tacos on soft corn torts. Most gluten free torts aren't soft, so I questioned that before ordering. Also, I wanted to substitute the meat for carne asada as I am not a fan of ground beef but the waiter said that they put MSG in their carne asada. Yuck, I thought and decided to stick with ground beef. They were okay, nothing special. They do have yummy green mild salsa though, which was better than my entire dinner. Service was great. I haven't heard that a Mexican restaurant uses MSG in their food before though. My friend order their chicken and steak fajitas, she said it was okay. I wondered though if her meat had MSG too. Eek!!"""

"1,""On 9/2/13 my wife and I went to the Chandler Mall Sears to buy a tool set for our sons birthday. We selected the set we wanted (no assistance from the staff). I carried the ~40 lb box to the checkout counter. We had parked near another entrance so I left my wife to check out while I moved the car. I didn't think I'd have to ask the checkout clerk to help my wife get the box to the curb. but sure enough when I asked my wife if the clerk helped her she said no. When the checkout process was complete he turned his back to her and sat down on the counter. That is where I found him when I went back in and ripped him a new one in front of other customers. We then contacted the department manager named Veronica (the same one mentioned in another review here). Veronica was of no help and in fact her attitude made me realize the store management is the problem. They do not care if customers are helped or walk out happy. I'm not sure where they think this strategy is going but my guess is it will take Sears out of business."""

Also, since I was sick, I ordered the tortilla soup. It was a thick soup and I actually prefer brothier tortilla soups. Wasn't bad though. As always, the cornbread was phenomenal.

"1,""What a lousy experience!!! My family and I get there at 12 noon on a Saturday and the place is almost empty. There's no one at the front desk to greet and seat us.

I inform him I'm deferring to my family first to be polite and expect him to be respectful. Needless to say at this point my meal was ruined. The manager is a man in his mid forties dressed like a slob and very disrespectful. He also doesn't manage his staff, as reflected by the disappearing acts the hostess and waiter pulled in a nearly empty restaurant hanging out in the back instead of attending to their customers. and with the disrespectful attitude that manager imposed on me.They have the gall to call this a top level restaurant.

"2,""This was a good bowling alley. Very clean and the service was friendly. We went on a Friday night and they had black lighting which is always fun. Shoes were decent and nice selection of bowling balls. Music videos from the early 2000s made the experience really fun! Scoreboards are not user friendly but that could be because we aren't big bowlers. Placement of TVs right over lanes was a bit distracting while bowling."""
"2,""Went to The Keg with my wife as she had never been and Flemings was booked.  The staff was very accommodating and friendly.  The server was excellent.  He checked in often, presented himself very well and was attentive to our needs.  We had a bottle of Ridge that was delicious.  The brie appetizer was very good.  Now onto the steak:  Each of us ordered a bacon wrapped filet medium rare.  Unfortunately, the steak came wrapped in bacon fat and was cooked closer to rare vs medium rare.  At times I'll order my steak rare or rare + so this wasn't a problem for me, but the bacon grizzle was unappetizing.  We had the creme brulee for dessert and it was average.  The Keg does a good job, but if the could pay a little more attention to detail with respect to the food.  I think they try and turn out the food too fast and it just doesn't compare to other steak houses.  Definitely a AAA club.

The pasta itself was surprisingly bland, but with a hint of salt and pepper, it was pretty tasty.  The bread that it came with was also delicious, all on its own.  I got the tomato soup, and man, it was definitely one of the better tomato soups I've been lucky enough to have.\n\nMy server was great about the food coming out quickly, and was on top of my refills.

"1,""This location of Starbucks let me down yesterday. It was 11am. I had met my sister here before we headed out on the town for the day. I was hungry for a breakfast sandwich or hot sandwich from the fridge that they will heat in the over for you. They were out of almost all flavors of sandwiches, they had only 3 left. They were also out of all breakfast sandwiches including the turkey bacon with egg, I understand that it was 11am but still, most Starbucks have these sandwiches well into the afternoon hours. \n\nI decided to try the faijita chicken sandwich with pepper jack from the refrigerated section at the counter. The cashier was very rude about the lack of sandwiches in the first place. She got irritated that I asked if they had a ham and swiss sandwich when it wasn't out. Anyhow, she heated up the sandwich and wrapped it up for me. The chicken was disgusting and I pulled a couple of pieces out and they had black spots on them. I am not sure how long that particular sandwich had been sitting out but eww.\n\nI did also have a passion tea and it was delicious as usual. Rule of thumb, come here only for drinks, avoid the food at this location. I would only come back for coffee or tea. Customer service was also not the greatest."""
"2,""OMG OMG OMG, the happy hour hamburger is so delicious (I think it's the bacon that does it). \n\nI've only been here twice, and both times for happy hour.

The drink specials are great too, they make a great margarita and have an ample wine list. I'll be back!"""
"2,""I came here recently for a special occasion dinner with my office staff and it was very nice.  The restaurant itself is well designed, with muted colors, dark woods and dimmed lighting.  The wait staff was neatly presented in crisp white shirts and clean, black service aprons.  We prearranged for a pre-printed dinner menu that was labeled as being for our party that night.  I thought that it was a nice touch, and I am well aware that it was also a clever cost containment measure since it also kept our staff from wildly ordering off of the regular Fleming's menu.\n\nOur servers were all very gracious and attentive and took very good care of our party of about 25.  Our food was all brought out at the same time, which was no small feat on the kitchen's part.  Everyone seemed genuinely happy with their food, I didn't see anyone complaining about anything.  \n\nI ordered the petite filet, medium rare, and it was absolutely perfect in every way.  The meat was cooked perfectly and was tender, moist and delicious.  There were various sides served 'family style' raging from buttered corn to asparagus, and they were all very good as well.  As a dessert I ordered cr\u00e8me brulee, and it was deliciously creamy with the perfectly sugar crust on top.  My only complaint about my food, and it is minor, was that the cr\u00e8me brulee wasn't the ice cold temperature that I usually prefer.  I like my cr\u00e8me brulee pre-fired so that it has time to cool off before I eat it.  I don't care for warm custard, but it's purely a personal preference and I still thought the dessert was fantastic.\n\nThe only other thing I would point out is that many people aren't fans of the a la carte menu system, it can be annoying, and ridiculously expensive, to order every side dish seperately from the main entree.   \n\nThat said, this was still a great experience in a wonderful restaurant.  I highly recommend it for any special occasion dinner as long as your budget will allow it."""
"2,""I have always loved Pei Wei as I'm an asian food lover from the SF Bay Area and I definitely have a sense for what's good and what's not.  Some might question the authenticity of their food, and I'm not asian so I don't consider myself to be an authority.  I do, however, LOVE the Pad Thai with chicken and tofu and everytime I order it, I'm in heaven :)  The portion is huge, seriously enough for 2-3 meals, the flavor is excellent, it's a little greasey which adds to the texture of the rice noodles, the chicken breast pieces are more than abundant and the tofu has a fabulous texture.  The crushed peanuts, lime and cilantro create a party in my mouth!!!\n\nYou just can't beat the overall quality, service and price.   It makes joints like Panda Express look embarrassing by comparison.  I like the fact that Pei Wei also rotates in new menu items (Sesame Chicken is new) and you can order brown rice as an option."""
"2,""I think Pei Wei is great. The food is always good and the location is nice enough to make you actually want to eat there. They do offer wine by the glass so it is a good place for Happy Hour or date night when you are trying to save some money (PF Changs is much nicer ambiance but basically the same food). However, most of the time we do curbside pickup which is awesome. You can also place your order online ahead of time."""
"1,""Um. . .No.  \n\nHonestly, I'm in a major snit about this place.  I expected something a LOT better than what we found here.  Things seemed pretty good to start--food looked tasty.  Didn't take long for problems to begin showing up:  \n\nFirst off, my wife's lo-mein was pretty darned lo.  The first time she went here several days ago, they used the normal wide noodle that you would usually find in lo-mein.  This time, they used round noodles.  Were they Chinese chow mein noodles?  No, they were vermicelli.  Yes, I'm being a bit picky there, but I'm just getting started.  My wife ordered the lo-mein with no garlic, onions, or shallots.  The problem was, they left out most of the other vegetables as well when the bowl came to the table.  There was the occasional carrot or broccoli sliver, but very few veggies at all.  I called the waiter over to the table and informed him of the situation.  My wife told him that she just wanted to get a bowl of extra veggies to add to the lo-mein.  He took away the lo-mein that she had and said that he would be back shortly.  When he returned, he came back with two bowls--one had the vegetables she asked for, and the other was a brand new bowl of lo-mein with tofu and noodles ONLY.  Uh, what the f*ck?  Why replace the noodles she had with this and then send in a separate bowl of veggies?  Why not either give my wife back her old bowl along with the veggies or just mix up a whole new batch with the veggies?  \n\nMajor issues here--even what she got after all that wasn't very good tasting.  My wife had to add soy sauce for extra flavor, and the vegetables weren't fresh--they obviously tasted like they were frozen before they were put into the wok.\n\nMy food wasn't much better in terms of quality.  I had the vegetable and tofu fried rice.  There was no issue with the quantity of veggies, but they too were of the \""""from your grocer's freezer\"""" variety.  The rice was chalky and undercooked, and I also had to add soy sauce--it didn't do much to improve the flavor.\n\nOur spring rolls were also inferior, and even the fortunes in the fortune cookies were as superficial and vapid as the food we ate.  I liked the friendly table service, and the soda machine that allowed you to flavor the soft drinks any way you like was cool.  This is what made this review two stars instead of one.  But, would I recommend Pei Wei to anyone?  No wei.  If you want a REAL Asian diner, go to Tott's Asian Diner at Ray and McClintock.  Now THAT'S fresh food, and a world of difference over Pei Wei.  Even Panda Express is better than this place."""
"2,""I had always sworn off chiropractors. I think it was the popping sounds that make me nervous. I decided to go to Cottingham, who was recommended by a coworker, as a way to lure in my fiance who was in constant pain. I gave Cottingham 4 stars as this is my first experience and I really had nothing to compare it to. But I do think Jeff is a 5 star guy. On your first visit he will do an exam and take xrays. On your second return he will go over the xrays and plan of care. Being in the medical field, I think Jeff is very good about explanations and helping you understand things visually and physically. His knowledge comes across and made me feel more comfortable with the whole process. I didn't feel he was trying to push me into any unnecessary treatment plan. I'm just sorry I waited so long."""

"2,""I am from the East Coast and am used to dive bars being a certain way, but this one is truly unique in that there are peanut shells littering the floors.  As I sat there, eating the roasted peanuts, and waiting for my food to arrive, I felt uneasy dumping my shells onto the floor.  I said to my friend, OMG, littering is okay here and I do not know how I feel about this.  \n\nSo after my initial shock of dropped peanut shells and the first bite of my Sue-Ruben, and the country music performers on stage creating a nice atmosphere, I started to get into the groove of things.  Throwing your shells on the floor can actually be quite liberating! lol\n\nI am a foodie and I must say that I was impressed with their take on the turkey ruben.  It was not as yummy as some of the places that make turkey rubens in NJ or NYC, but it truly did come in second for my taste buds.  \n\nMy friends wings were a little bland and the hot sauce that he ordered on the side was not that appealing.  Maybe I need to try more of their wings another time, since everyone seems to love them"
"1,""Just came in with my husband for my 6 month ring inspection. It was a Monday afternoon so nobody was in there except like maybe 2 customers. We were not greeted upon entering so my husband walked up to a group of employees who were laughing and joking around to ask for help. They literally ignored him, just let him stand there looking stupid for a good 2-3 minutes. So we walked around the counter obviously looking for some help and had to practically wave our hand in the air and shout before someone would finally help us. Unbelievable customer service. Would not come to this branch if I were you. We definitely did not feel like we were worth a minute of their time."""

I like borders for a few reasons, but I find that their store is well stocked and the staff is usually really friendly.  \n\nI wandered the store, and even though I didnt have a specific book in mind, I had an idea of what I wanted to read.  I like thier bargin book section, and the layout of the store, with overhead signs, and signs on the actual bookstore itself.\n\nEven though I did not purchase anything, shopping here was fun.

"1,""\""""Authentic Mexican Food\"""" seems to be a complete lie here. I feel like Taco Bell is more authentic than Espo's. 2 Stars, because the Carne Asada Taco Salad I got was nothing but a bowl of lettuce, a few chips, and small balls of Carne Asada every once in awhile. They took over 30 minutes to deliver our order. (There was only about 5 people in the entire restaurant, 3 of which were already eating.) Then, they got our orders wrong, and also charged us extra to put something that was already included in the salad on the side. Only good thing: The Salsa, and the Bowl it came in."""
"1,""I stopped in here for dinner recently to see how the place looked after their recent \""""remodel\"""" and I was surprised to see that even though there were improvements made to the exterior (fresh paint, expanded parking lot, and nicer patio) the inside looked exactly the same except they had replaced the rundown, ugly, uncomfortable tables and chairs with others that were only slightly less ugly and uncomfortable. Everything else was exactly the same, including the layer of grime over all the fixtures, walls, and flooring. I was willing to overlook that since we usually only do takeout anyway but once we ate our food my husband and I both agreed that we would not come here again. The quality of food has been going down the last couple of months but this was a new low. I have never liked the place itself but at least I thought the food was decent but nothing we ordered this last visit was even edible.  Dry, crumbly tamales, burnt tortilla chips, and carne asada that tasted like the meat had spoiled. The worst part was the crispy taco that was disgustingly soggy and filled with a substance that looked like dog food and tasted like what I would imagine that canned dog food tastes like. I mean, it was worse than Taco Bell. Seriously.\n\nThere still seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in the door, again mostly take-out orders, so I guess their customers are very loyal or else not everyone thinks it's gotten as bad as I do. I think most of their loyal fans keep coming back since it is so cheap, but there are lots of better options for cheap Mexican food in Chandler."""
"1,""I recently went to lunch at Espos, and engaged in an epic battle for a churro.\n\nAs I approached the counter to get my chorizo burrito and churro, the churro was missing and a plate of sopapillas was there instead. Before I could say anything, the woman behind the counter said bluntly, \""""We're out of churros, so I gave you sopapillas.\""""\n\nI thought about it for a second, and realized only a churro was really worth the extra flab my friends would see at the pool that weekend, and told her, politely, I'd really just prefer to not have sopapillas.\n\n\""""You just want your dollar back?\"""" she barked, as if I had asked her to drive to the U.S. treasury to collect one. I said yeah, I just love churros, and don't think I need anything else.\n\nShe huffed to the register, grabbed a dollar, and handed it to me.\n\nNow look, one doesn't want to be petty, but really, the churro (after tax) costs $1.26. As I looked at her face that was saying, \""""Why couldn't you just eat your damn sopapillas like I told you to?\"""" it occurred to me I shouldn't have to pay Espos twenty-six cents for a churro I never got.\n\n\""""I think it was a $1.15 on the menu,\"""" I said.\n\nOh man, now she was pissed. Saying nothing, she hit a few buttons on the register, \""""returned\"""" a churro officially, and handed me $1.26.\n\nAll of that drama might be worth it, if the chorizo didn't taste as bland as watery ground beef.

"1,""Was not impressed. The seaweed salad was drowned in sesame oil and every roll was entirely overwhelmed by sauce (there was a quarter cup of garlic sauce left on the plate when we finished the Primo roll, no hint of exaggeration.) And for a place that charges for forks, you'd think they'd pack the rolls a little tighter so they don't utterly disintegrate. It was heavy, heavy fare and we left feeling overfull and gross even though we ate about half as much as we usually do on sushi night (and both had gas pains for a couple of hours afterward).\n\nThe free strawberry ice cream was not delicious and the fortune cookie was downright weird."""

The contract jobs out here in California usually run for three months at a time and after each quarter, they extend them.

You think  Bank of America would want to help us make it easier to get through the economy crisis. Just to let you know I am speaking about the Loan Department in Chandler Arizona. Not only did they take forever to get the paperwork done, they called and told us to return documents as soon as possible so that our approved loan will get completed.

"2,""How do you start off a review when you're simply flabbergasted? Liberty Market has flabbergasted me. What a place. It is so unassuming from the street, almost leaving you wondering if you're in the right place, but then you walk through those doors and feel like you've been transported to some magical dream world. Here's a word of warning, I will be gushing until the end of this review. \n      I asked my dear Kristen to find us a new restaurant last night for dinner, and she, through a very unorthodox way, found us Liberty Market. I asked her if she was sure it was a restaurant and not a market, she said yes, and we were off. While driving over to Gilbert she let me know that the owner of Liberty Market was also the owner of Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill, this excited me to no end because those two places are wonders themselves, masterfully put together and designed, if I may say so myself, and Liberty Market is no different. \n      Sitting next to a fun water park of sorts (a great place for photography), it is set in beautiful downtown Gilbert, and right when we walked in the door we were greeted by every employee under the sun, it seemed even the chefs ran out from the kitchen to say hello. Now, this was not because it was slow, there were quite a few people there, not quite busy, but hopping for sure, they simply are awesome employees. The atmosphere here is incredible and the interior has a wonderful modern design, there is even a \""""market\"""" where you can purchase various drinks and old timey trinkets. The salad and bread chefs conversed with us and explained how the market worked, so we sat ourselves down, looked over a menu, and picked our delights for the night. \n      Kristen stuck with tea, while I had an Anchor Brewing \""""Liberty Ale\"""" as we began our meal sharing the starter pizza, a delicious, light, grilled flat bread with olive oil, pecorino romano, rosemary and hummus to dip it in. We were already hooked with just the starter. The bread was so good, warm and airy, the cheese had a perfect bite and the hummus was a perfect topper, nothing too heavy and nothing too lite, simply a delicious starter, leaving us ready for the next tasty morsel. I ordered the flatiron steak with chimichurri sauce, garlic smashed potatoes, and fresh from the ground grilled vegetables. The steak... oh boy, the steak... it was so flavorful, cooked perfectly, not tough at all, I'm having a hard time finding words to describe the deliciousness, it was just so good. The chimichurri sauce added a wonderful dimension, it was light but flavorful, never overpowering. I thought the potatoes were awesome, a great blend of big delicious fresh chunks of potato and small hunks of garlic, and the vegetables (carrots and asparagus) had a wonderful grilled taste that brought out their natural goodness. A truly special and wonderful dish. Kristen ordered the liberty bowl with pasta (essentially spaghetti and meatballs) and loved it. The meatballs were big and filling, wonderfully seasoned and cooked. The marinara sauce was done really well, tangy and rich with an intoxicating aroma and the noodles were tender yet had a good bite to them. I am by no means a pasta man, and I thought it was terrific. With every bite, we each were just overwhelmed with our plates. The food at Liberty Market seems to have been very well planned out with careful seasoning and incredible ingredients. \n      We will be back to Liberty Market, many many times. You simply have to try it, you will see what I mean, see why it's so special. Also, don't leave without visiting the restrooms, all of them, peek inside each one. I love cool restaurant bathrooms, and these are some of the best."""
"2,""I'll admit up front Liberty Market is my all time favorite restaurant, and I love it.  Spent a lot of time and money there.

They are friendly, attentive and enjoy being alive.  My favorite dish, the salmon BLT... HIGHLY recommend it.  It's fabulous.  Breakfast is also GREAT here.\nOnly thing you could complain about is it gets really busy, but that's what happens to good restaurants.\nThis is a must-visit restaurant... might become your favorite too!"""
"2,""Liberty market is fast becoming one of my favorite lunch time treats. They have a menu that while not huge seems to have something for everyone. I am in love with their white pizza.

"1,""Dissatisfied. I heard such great things about this place and low and behold, the food was bland. The egg salad sandwich was eggs and mayo, with no taste at all. The tomato basil soup was horrible, and the \""""garlic\"""" hummus had less flavor than my glass of water. I would not recommend."""
"2,""Was surprised by this restaurant mainly due to its Diner look from the outside but by the reco of most yelpers had to try it out.

I know live very close to this restaurant and vow to come quite often and try everything on the menu.\n\nOnly reason it did not get 5 stars was because the elbow room is not very good here, tables are RIGHT next to each other. I understand you have to pack in as much as you can but it was difficult having a conversation wondering if the people next to you who are in the middle of chewing are listening in. Other than that great place."""
"2,""I came here the day before Christmas Eve with my family for dinner.  We came in 15 til 5 on a Sunday and were surprised how many tables were open... we were anticipating a possible wait, but my sister who comes here often had prepared us that if there was a wait, it would be worth every minute.  Everything was just so fresh.  My niece and nephew each got  a burger, my father got the spaghetti and meatballs, and my mom and sis got salads.  I had the picnic sandwich with potato salad.  It was awesome!  All homemade, and like I said, very fresh ingredients.  If you're looking for a five dollar footlong, this isn't the place to go.  The desserts looked AMAZING, but are SO big that I didn't have room.  This would be a good place to come with a friend and have coffee and split a dessert.  The environment fits it well too.  Very airy and fresh with a retro jet age feel to it, maybe from all the steel."""
"2,""Haven't reviewed this place in almost 2 years.  I should probably update!\n\nLiberty Market appears to be very popular, always busy. Some nights they have chef's specials.  Tonight was one of those nights, and that's what I ordered (the rib-eye).\n\nFirst, it was overpriced (probably the only reason not to give them 5 stars tonight).  But it was cooked perfectly, and had a nice sauce.  The accompanying potatoes and broccoli (from Agritopia) was very nice.  A solid four-star dish.\n\nThe others ordered a burger (with chips) and a pizza.  They seemed to enjoy them.  The prices on those were also a bit more reasonable.\n\nService was very good.  We were greeted several times between the door and the counter, and a woman I think was likely the owner checked on us later as well.\n\nThis remains one of our favorite American cuisine restaurants with a unique flare.  Not ostentatious or snooty.  A casual elegance."""
"2,""Liberty Market is my favorite place to get brunch in the area. I've had a handful of items off the menu, but, by far, my favorite two items are the  french toast and the breakfast burrito. \n\nFirst, the french toast. They have a different take on it so it is actually bread pudding. It's moist, sweet without being too sweet, and def some of the best french toast I've ever had. It's pretty much FLAWLESS. \n\nNext, the breakfast burrito. I'm usually not a huge fan of breakfast burritos, but this baby is def a winner. The sauces on top are far from bland and are what make the burrito so good. Of course the meat and potatoes inside add a lot, but the sauce is what truly makes it so spectacular. \n\nI've had a couple of other items off the menu such as the sandwiches (breakfast and lunch), pizza, and red velvet cake, but none are to rave about. However, if I was going to add another item to my meal, it'd be the cinnamon bun. Beware, it's quite large and only tastes good while warm."""
"2,""THE BEST PIZZA ANYWHERE !!! The owners are incredibly nice and put a lot of effort and pride in their business."""
"1,""Please do something about the employees there! Constantly smoking right outside the door so you have to smell it when walking in. Never doing anything behind the counter when you walk in, but too busy counting cigarrettes or whatever to help you pay. Ridiculousy long conversations with customers, or friends in the store, oh, free drinks form the fountain too if you know them. Apparantly are trading discounts with the nearby sushi place too. \n\nINFURIATING!"""
"2,""So I went to this place when I first moved over to this area and I liked it a lot. Then, for some reason, I thought I would try another shop in the area and, although it was pretty good, it was not awesome and it always seemed more expensive than it should be. \n\nSo I returned to Paulene's today and I certainly won't be changing again! \n\nI got a regular fill and I needed a toe nail fixed as I had an injured toe and half the nail came off while it was healing. I also got a deluxe pedicure that was pure heaven! She spent lots of time on me and they turned out beautifully!\n\nTheir service and the fact that they care about their work and their great pricing makes this an excellent nail salon."""

"1,""I'll start with the good.  Their coleslaw is fantastic, crisp and sweet and light with little bits of broccoli in it.  \nNow for the rest.  I went with two friends and my two children, one of which uses a high chair.  We walked in on a Monday afternoon and the place was about half full.  A waitress motioned from the back for us to sit at a round table so we did, picking up our own menus on the way.  And then we sat.  And sat.  My son squirmed around on my lap but I had nowhere to put him.  I watched two different waitresses walk by us repeatedly, even cleaning tables but not making eye contact. I finally flagged one down and she came over and said, \""""You've been helped right?\""""  We said no and she turned around and left.  A few minutes later a different waitress comes up, tells us we want coffee and seems put out when we ask for something else and sighs when I say I need a high chair.  5 more minutes go by and we get half the drinks.  Then a few minutes later the rest.  I can put up with lackluster service as long as the food is good and I had heard great things about this place so I held on to my patience.  I ordered the Long John with mushrooms.  Well, I can tell you that if I ever run out of hockey pucks for my local team, I know where to go.  It was almost inedible.  Dry, tough overcooked ground beef patty with a smattering of tasteless mushrooms topped with half melted cheese.  I actually asked for a side of ranch so I could dip it in that to make it moist enough to eat.  The waitress never asked how the food was, and we never saw her again after she ran my credit card.  \nI hope that this was just an off day but really the second star is only because of the coleslaw.  I will probably try it again if someone else wants to go, but overall not a winner in my book."""
"2,""Fantastic. Loved every part of my meal, huge portions, great drinks, and fairly priced. Its become the new place I like to show friends that visit from out of town. The biggest turn off about this restaurant in the past is the huge line I always see when I drive by but I went on a Sunday morning and there wasn't even a wait. Just have to pick the right days I guess."""
"1,""I've been here twice. First time was a couple years ago. It was pretty good. We decided to go for our anniversary. Monday morning, only 4 tables of customers. Nothing special about this restaurant. We asked the waitress if there were breakfasts with biscuits and gravy. She said no, you need to order the side, which was $5. Breakfast was overcooked, toast was burnt, nothing special about the French toast. $30 for two...not worth it. Outside...big specials sign showing exactly what I ordered with biscuits and gravy, just $5 cheaper. Biscuits were too soft, gravy had no flavor. I'm not sorry I accidentally left my leftovers."""
"2,""Goodness gracious, Flancer's is not for the light eater or the small stomach! \n\nIt took me far too long to stop into this tiny little shop considering that I live ever so close, and am always complaining about the lack of awesome food in this area.  The menu was so impressive that I had to have my server come back three times because I could not decide what to order! \n\nI ordered the BLTA with fries, and let me tell ya, I don't know how anyone gets through an entire sandwich.  I snarfed down the AMAZING fries, and half my delectable sandwich, and had to box the rest.  I could hardly get into my car, and don't tell anyone, but I definitely unbuttoned the ole' pants once I was out of public view.  OMG.\n\nMy one-star deduction is because upon arriving home, I flopped onto my bed for some rest because my stomach was working overtime on the BLTA, and next thing I knew, it was 3 a.m.!! I lost my entire evening to my sandwich.  \n\nAll discomfort aside, the food was outstanding, the prices were right for the quality of the meal, and I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu as soon as I can budget out the time to recover afterwards."""
"2,""We've been to Flancers many times and its always been great.  Its hard not to get the Philly Cheese-steak as it is *perfection*, but we've loved everything else we've ordered there too.  The place is very down to earth and could do with a makeover, but overall we really like it.  The staff is friendly and do a great job overall."""
"2,""I had heard a lot about Flancer's from the \""""Mouth by Southwest\"""" blog and was interested to try it.  I had heard of multiple tap takeovers and other events so I was excited to see what beers they had on tap.  All that stuff must have been at the other Flancer's location, because this location didn't look like it even had taps or a bar.  My husband ordered an imperial IPA from New Belgium that he thought was pretty good (in a bottle) and I ordered the prickly pear spiked lemonade.  There was not much prickly pear flavor, but you could tell the lemonade itself was fresh squeezed.  \n\nThe sandwiches were the real highlight of our visit.  I got a sandwich with pork, arugula, tomato relish and onions.  It was amazing!  The bread was incredibly soft, but it still had a chewy outer coating so the sandwich didn't fall apart.  My husband got the Philly and he really liked it.  He is very hard to please when it comes to Philly sandwiches.  He was a huge fan of the bread.  I really liked the green chili mac and cheese too.  The jalape\u00f1o mashed potatoes were insanely hot, but if you're into that, they are right up your alley.  I would love to try more of Flancer's sandwiches!"""
"1,""Went to Flancers the first time this last week.  I got the Prickly Pear Caesar Chicken.  I was not a fan.  The dressing didn't taste much like Caesar and while the Prickly Pear flavoring was tasty, it seemed odd for a Caesar.  I got the salad when we could not get a wheat crust pizza larger than 10 inch for the hubbie and I to share.  He said the pizza was okay, but it didn't look appetizing to me.  The bread that came w/ my salad, loaded w/ parmesan cheese, was tasty, but for a carb watcher, too much.  Now that I think about it, I don't remember the taste of parmesan on the salad.\n\nMy biggest knock on the place:  the lager beer selection.  American lagers only.  I don't care for American lagers.  Bud Light makes me burp, a lot, and American lagers to me lack the flavor of a Stella, Phuket, Corona, Peroni, etc.  For a restaurant that offers beer pairings, they need to overhaul the lager selection for those of us not into ales.  I'd visit one more time if I could have a Stella w/ my meal, but with the lager selection, I can scratch them off my list."""
"1,""Visited on Friday.  Ordered the Match with Hatch burger with jalapeno & cheddar potato pie on the side.  Presentation was good.  The burger was disappointing to be honest -- green chile was minimal (and not flavorful) and served luke warm.  The picture on the website and menu looks oh so much better.  The potato pie was good and had a bit of pizzazz to it that the burger lacked and was served hot.  Customer service was good and lots of \""""regular customers\"""" were about ordering.  I won't be back but given the regular clientele within, it probably satisfies many peoples tastes."""
"2,""Stopped in for a beer and to try something new for lunch. The staff was very friendly and patient with me looking over the menu. I took the waiters advice and decided to try the prickly pear chicken sandwich with a side of the green chili mac. Now, I was hesitant about this chicken sandwich.... I mean, prickly pear, what does that even mean? But take it from me... it is a must try. I brought the sandwich to my mouth and instantly feel in love. It is by far the most interesting chicken sandwich I've ever had. Is one of those things I can't explain WHY, all I can do is tell you that you will love it. The beer was great. The green chili mac was interesting as well, but delicious. I have just found my new favorite lunch spot."""
"2,""Just thought I'd help some customers out.\nI've worked here for almost 2 years now and what i notice is the thing that deters people the most is the price. So i thoght I'd help you guys out. For most basic custard without a topping, so like a single vanilla will run you around $2.13. Not that bad, but if you were to get 4 for eexample that'd be around $8.50. If we were to serve perfectly each time, 4 single scoops would be a pint which we actually do sell for around $5.06. If you dont mind sharing a cup and just using 4 spoons. But if you want some topping and a decent amount of custard which im sure you do. You will want to order the not so much ordered BANANA SPLIT! For $4.99 plus tax you get 3 scoops of custard,your choice, a banana (of course), 2 toppings, and a nut. That beats any custard item on our menu besides our Concrete which is also very good.\nNow for the Grinders. There isn't really a way around the price besides getting a job here and getting an employee discount. but let me tell you THEY ARE WORTH IT!\nWith fresh cut deli meats, fresh bread made from a recipe passed through generations, and their DELICIOUS and often misinterpeted pepper relish.

"1,""Several friends and I drove from Surprise, AZ to the annual Peach Festival at Schnepf Farms.  We have done this many times, but this was the last time we will ever attend.  The first obstacle was the slow moving traffic on Rittenhouse Road causing us to creep along for 45 minutes to complete the last 2 miles of the trip.  There were 5 Sheriff's Police cars there, but they seemed to do nothing to help.  We got in finally and for the first time did not have to wait long to have our pancake breakfast.  We then tried to buy peaches, but that was almost impossible, They only brought in peaches from the orchard every 1/2 hour to sell.  We had to wait in line in the direct sun and there was only one cashier for a crowd of hundreds.  The store had one cashier too.  No signs or directions.  We were so disappointed we are never going back again.  This festival has been going on for years why was it so poorly organized???\n\n We went down to the Queen Creek Olive Mill and enjoyed the air conditioning, a cool beverage, and bought several items."""

Last year my husband and teenagers went on the roller coaster about 8 times.  This year my twins are working at the farm learning working skills, customer service and teamwork.  How wonderful that the owners give back to the community in which their farm resides.  It is sad that there are complaints about the cost, this is the only time of year there is an admission fee and entertainment always has a price.  Arizona in October has beautiful weather and adults and children alike can enjoy the walks, food, entertainment and other things to do.  Lots of fun activities for children and adults.  How wonderful to have a local operating farm in our area.  As our children grow and grandchildren are born, I can't wait to continue the tradition with them.

We chose this place based on their location to the Salt River Fields for Spring Training.\n\nWe called ahead of time to see if they could handle 3 pedicures & 1 manicure at the same time. They said \""""Yes, come on in.\"""" Um, no. There were only 3 ladies working, and one was already busy. What should have been a 45 minute trip to the nail place, ended up being an hour and half!\n\nThe ladies here are not friendly, and they are slow. My toes look like I could have painted them myself. They severely lack color options for regular polish and gel. The space is average -- clean and newer pedicure stations, but the seats were not very comfortable. I would not come back again nor recommend to a friend."""
"2,""Great pizza and wings! The polish sausage's are the best and their hot roast beef sandwiches are awesome! If you are ever around McDonald & Granite Reef in Scottsdale you have try this place! You'll love it!"""
"2,""Like Home Depot this is a toy store for big boys.  While they have much the same as any other hardware store, some items are different brands. The staff was very friendly making our trip very pleasent."""
"1,""Terrible customer service!! Went in at 7:30 in the morning and it was not busy at all. Staff was very unfriendly and quick to just point you in the direction of items we were looking for and then turn around and go back to their task or paperwork. Not helpful!! Lynn was the only one that was pleasant enough to speak with us and offer advice on a project we are working on. Everyone else was just walking by, head down, moving slow. Perhaps they need to offer their staff COFFEE to WAKE them UP at their morning meeting! Oh, and take some happy pills while you're at it, too!\n\nSelection on what we needed was poor, too!\n\nAND they cut my key wrong a few days ago. I ended up going to a Lowes near my work...Happy Valley. The customer service at the Happy Valley location was far superior and what I expected from them. Go to the Happy Valley location for excellent customer service...Ryan was super helpful in the key department!!! For something so small as getting a key re-cut, you could tell he cared about his customers!"""
"1,""Like another reviewer here we made the mistake of buying an appliance from them (dishwasher). Both my wife and I made it clear that we wanted it installed and the Lowe's salesman made it clear to us that they would install it when they delivered it. We waited two weeks for the delivery only to be told by the delivery guys when they arrived that they don't do installations. \n\nWe had them take the dishwasher back"
"1,""I wish there was a 0-star Rating here, because he deserves it!\n\nI dropped my watch off for repair 3 months ago and I have not seen it since. He keeps telling me that his \""""watch guy\"""" hasn't brought it back. Or, his watch guy has been out of town. Or, he will check with his watch guy and call me later in the day, which he never does. At this point, I will give up on my $100 watch just so I don't have to hear any more of his lies. DO NOT GO HERE under any circumstances! I also find it strange that no one else is ever in the store when I go in. Ever. Something strange is going on here."""
"2,""Good service. The daughter works the front and she is nice and works hard to make sure the restaurant runs well and is clean. \nThe food is really good for AZ/MEX. Cheap. Carne Asada burrito is very good. Also, the beans are authentic. One of the best breakfast burritos around. \nNow, some people knock the location and decor. Well, I don't eat either one so I'l leave that to other raters ( my friends say I can eat a lounge chair in less than a minute). \nNice people and quick to get your order out. Recommended by this mexican food aficionado."""
"1,""The food was just okay, I have had much better from many taco joints.  I am rather bummed because this place is not far from where I live.  \n\nMy sister and I ordered chicken, carnitas, and carne asada tacos to share.  The carne asada was the best of the 3, but nothing to write home to mom about.  The carnitas was overcooked and crispy/burnt/dry.  The chicken taco was pretty good, but again nothing exciting.  The sauces (green and red salsa) were not very spicy and rather blah.  I can say the service was very fast and the prices were cheap.  Most of the tables were not cleaned off in the restaurant.  Also, we ordered everything without guacamole and that seems to be their claim to fame, so maybe we are a bit biased and missing out on the key ingredient.  \n\nI will be back if I am in desperate need of a taco nearby, but I will hopefully find a better place before that desperate moment occurs."""
"2,""As I've said before, I typically  don't  bother writing a review when there is already a voluminous set of other reviews stating everything I'd want to, and more concisely than I could... but Sakana is my favorite sushi bar in the valley, so I'm still going to add my two cents.\n\nI've never had a bad meal at Sakana. Even when busy, which seems to be more often than not as of late, the service is good, the prices are decent and the portions huge.\n\nRecently, they started having a Monday night happy hour-ish menu offering discounted maki rolls that include lettuce in the place of avocado. I've also seen promotions offering appetizers for 0.50 when you buy a Kirin or Kirin Light. Oh yeah, last but not least, you get orange slices with your bill... which is a nice touch."""
"2,""A prospective customer at Sakana must check out the Customer Appreciation Sushi Roll menu before ordering from the \""""main\"""" menu. Customer Appreciation rolls are the full size rolls at most Japanese restaurants in California and tastes just as good if not better.\n\n$7 for 5 large cuts of Hamachi sashimi. Add $2 for a bowl of sushi rice and you will be in sashimi heaven. The Ikura at this restaurant are the best I have ever tasted anywhere.\n\nBeers for as afforadable as $3.25. Sodas with free refills for $1.95.\n\nCan you find this quality at these prices in Scottsdale? I didn't think so!"""
"1,""I never thought I'd be giving my go to sushi joint 2 stars, but alas I am.  It's sad but true, over the past year I've watched Sakana slip. I'm not sure what happened to the little neighborhood sushi place that was once \""""authentic\"""".\n\nLast night was the last straw.  Like always I ordered a house salad that at one time was chalk full of tomatoes, fresh sliced mushrooms and a delightful ginger dressing.  This was not the case last night.  There was ONE sliced tomato and no mushrooms . The gingery dressing that I once loved has now been converted into the salty, orange mess.  I tried to eat it but after I felt the taste buds in my mouth disintegrating from sodium overload, I stopped. \n\nNext came the sushi.  We ordered 3 different rolls"
"1,""I don't know how this place got a 4-star average.  We showed up later in the evening, but they were still open and seating.  Out of 4 rolls, one was good.  The other three were pretty disgusting.  They were made sloppily, everything had TONS of mayo and not enough spice.  They smash up the salmon for their spicy salmon, which leads me to believe it's not very fresh, and it makes for a very mushy texture.\n\nThe miso soup was good, at least...\n\nAnyway, they turned on the bright lights and started stacking chairs before we had finished paying.  Sorta rude.  As a server who has worked in restaurants for a long time, I think that if you take tables until 9:30, you should expect to properly wait on them until they are finished.  Otherwise close earlier and don't take the table.\n\nI'm NEVER going back here,  Ew."""
"2,""My \""""go to\"""" place for Sushi.  Great rolls, busy yet fun atmosophere, and you can't beat the M-Thursday specials.  I agree with some of the other reviews about the waitstaff.  Some are a little forgetful but they are always polite and friendly.  Give it a try, you wont be disappointed."""
"1,""\""""I'm sorry you feel that way\"""" is often used to dismiss a woman's opinion or thought. It's an attempt to silence her. So not only does your sushi suck you try to silence  your customers that are taking their time to provide constructive criticism in a form of a review.\n\nThe sushi that I had was not fresh. Others have reviewed that their sushi was NOT fresh. If multiple people are saying your seafood is not fresh then it is not fresh. \n\nI was born in and spent a lot of my life in a fishing village off the Mediterranean Sea with a family full of fishermen. I also served in the United States Coast Guard and served in Boston and and more than aware of the seafood coming from there and how it should look like. I am more than qualified to know what fresh seafood is and what is not. I am also qualified to know what is real seafood and what is not. Imitation crab meat is NOT real seafood.\n\nI even took into consideration and lowered my standards a bit cause we are--after all in the desert.  Your sushi was not even \""""fresh for Arizona\""""."""
"1,""Customer Service Sucks at this golf course soooooooo BAD!  Been there 4 times and every time have an issue checking in or with one of the GOLF Pros.  This golf course by far has the worst employees ever. The course is usally in good condition but always get turned off by the employees. On top of it all they do not even have a driving range to practice. Do not recommend this course at all."""
"2,""I love this place. Great breakfasts, lunches and dinners. \nTheir pastrami is the best in the state, and their turkey that is used in sandwiches tastes real (as in NOT the watery deli stuff you find in most places). They did get rid of my favorite \""""sandwich\"""",  the El Paso Wrap, but I've found they'll still make it for me when I get a craving for it. The chicken soups are delish and home made (and wonderful when you are sick with the flu or a cold). \nNeedless to say, their bagels are killer. \nFrequently a line, but worth the wait, if you have the time. \nHighly recommend this place!!"""
"2,""Very good bagels and sandwiches!"""
"2,""Great service, even for a busy Saturday.  Our server was a grandmother too, which was really cool.  Food was above average but nothing great.  Bread/toast was good, pancakes I can't understand why they're popular, and actually the Southwest breakfasts were rather good - breakfast enchiladas, for example.  Popular spot, and I can see why."""
"2,""Best bakery in town! Feels like new York"""
"1,""First, I want to say from my experience, Chompie's food is very good. Not excellent, but very good.  The service, on the other hand was very poor.  Chompie's is a bit on the expensive side. If there service was good, I might accept that but with poor service, I can't give it higher than 2 stars. \n\nI went to the bakery during lunchtime on Sept. 13th. It was busy so I waited in line like everyone else. As I moved along in line I was asked for my order which included a few bagels, some cookies and a takeout sandwich.  So I'm pulled out of line by one lady who want to ring up my order at this cash register at the stat of the line, not at the end of the line where you usually pay.  I start to take out my wallet and she tells me credit card only, if I want to pay with cash,  I have to get back in line and wait for the OTHER cash register.  O.K. I give her my credit card to pay, but I'm thinking that was annoying. \n\nShe tells me my takeout order will be ready soon. It was a simple bagel sandwich.  So I wait, and wait, and wait. 15 minutes later I ask the lady for the status of this, and it turns out the lady never sent the order to the kitchen so of course its not going to be done.  5 more minutes and its finally done.\n\nThey need to get a bit more organized and provide better service, or I can tell you I will never be back.  There are too many other good places around to deal with one that couldn't care less about my business."""
"1,""Coming from Michigan which has one or two outstanding Deli's, Chompie's was a huge disappointment.  Their corned beef was lousy compared to Vienna brand.  Their prices are beyond ridiculous.  I will continue my search for a good Jewish Deli in Arizona."""
"1,""I really don't want to give a bad review of this place, but they don't seem to have the same standards for the take-out orders that they do for their dine-ins.\n\nDine ins are great, the food is always excellent. \n\nI've been ordering take out lately and there's always been a problem with my order. \n\nI get the Cabo skillet with homefries, and they keep not including the salsa and sour cream condiments. Today, I didn't get the melted jack cheese on my skillet, which completely killed the meal for me and was the last straw, which is why I'm writing this review. \n\nThey also made my home fries hash browns instead, which were underseasoned and undercooked .\n\nQuite a shame because I get nothing but the cabo skillet and its usually been excellent without any of these problems when I dine in. \n\nI ordered a different skilled and asked for scrambled eggs, instead I got overcooked fried eggs which also killed the entree. \n\n\nI'm going to give them another chance next week, and if the same problem presists I'll probably stop eating here again."""

Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.\n\n...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.

"1,""Oh my goodness. I haven't had a good experience with Chompie's lately and it's not just this location. The service is ALWAYS a hit or miss. I walked in last week when it was pretty slow and the two ladies standing around at the front didn't even say a simple \""""hello\"""". I asked them if we had to wait to be seated and without answering, they looked at each other with a smirk and nodded at the hostess to \""""take care of us\"""". \n\nNot the most welcoming feeling.

"1,""Used to come here all the time in the past (few years ago) and the tong sandwich was always great.  However, came back over the Thanksgiving holiday this year to get my tong sandwich fix while back in town, and the meat was over cooked and dry.

"1,""This place was recommended to me so I decided to try it out. BIG mistake. I tried their Jampong soup and it was the WORST Jampong and worst soup I have ever had. The noodles weren't fresh...infact they tasted like they had been frozen for 5yrs too long. Extremely mushy and not edible. The soup was bland and was not proper Jampong soup. I think they mixed a couple sauces together with water and called it Jampong. The seafood and beef were dismal and the shrimp that was in the soup wasn't cleaned properly. Please do us all a favor and take this so called Jampong soup off your menu."""
"2,""Let me sum this up: I liked the way I looked.\n\nI needed to rent a tux for a black tie wedding in about two weeks. Came in and was quickly greeted by younger looking employees who were very friendly but slightly unpolished. When I think of suits, I think of older gentlemen, preferably with accents and finely coiffed beards. Nevertheless, the young lady working the computer pointed out various shapes, sizes and selections for my tux. She ascertained my budget and attempted to fit it. Despite my ignorance, she guided me through the process of accessorizing appropriately for the style I wanted. They took my measurements and told me to come back a couple days before the wedding.\n\nTo my satisfaction, the tux came in early! Everything fit perfectly and I walked out a happy and prepared man.\n\nPolicy states that you must return the tux (in one piece) the day following the event. The nice thing is, ANY Men's Wearhouse will accept back your partially soiled attire. I made sure not to lose pieces and avoided any penalties.\n\nThe whole rental cost me about $120 (including deposit). Pricey, maybe. But, consider all the free food and drink at the wedding! And after all, isn't looking awesome, priceless?\n\nTuxedo Renting Tips:\n-If you choose suspenders, do it for function. No one will actually see them... unless you want them to.\n-Don't forget to brush off those nice cufflinks you got as a grad present years ago. Otherwise, you're stuck with the free ones they include.\n-Bow-ties are cool. The ones they give you are clip-on. Unless you're really good at tying one, opt for the clip-on."""
"1,""Our party of four met at Houston's for a late lunch this week.  The service was excellent and the food was very good, though over priced ($14 for a small plate of veggies? ), but we all left with the same complaint, \""""Why do they play such loud music?!\""""   We could barely hear each other despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty.    The ambiance of Houston's seemed to conflict with loud music overhead -- I won't be back, even if eating alone."""
"1,""Got me usually good food.Placed was packed.Steak was average and French fries cold.Service was fine."""
"2,""Definitely call ahead for a reservation.  We were out and decided to eat her since it was near by.

Would I eat here again,  definitely buy only with a reservation."""
"1,""My wife and I have been going to Houston's for about 5 years, as time goes bye Houston's service/ food has really taken a back seat to the quality food/service we were used to. The last two times for dinner my wife and I love the prime rib French dip we were told both times they were sold out of the prime rib, so we opted for the Hawaiian steak(yuk) ask for medium rare it was over cooked n the taste was awful, as we were choking down the Hawaiian steak we watched waiter after waiter serving the same prime rib French dip to customers after we have almost finished are dinner, The service the last two times there has been just terrible, I know I won't be back, to all u Houston lovers enjoy, but don't settle for less like I did, Houston's has gone down hill, peace, John"""
"1,""What a terrible experience.  I love Houston's and there are very few restaurant chains that I can say that about.  I look forward to going to a Houston's any time I can.  We went into this one on a Friday evening, February 21st of this year.  It was later in the evening but we were just going to have a drink at the bar and perhaps a snack.  We walked in and the place was jumping.  Luckily there were a few seats available at the bar where we saw one of the bartenders JUST serving entrees as we arrived.  We were met by a female bartender (blonde) who stopped us in our tracks to say \""""sorry we are closing and so longer serving\"""".  Again- the place was packed and people were still waiting for their dinners!  I know the difference between stopped seating vs stopped serving!  She was so fricking rude that it has stuck with me these past four months!  We explained we were just looking to have a drink and maybe a snack but couldn't even get the sentence out before she shut us down again.  Clearly she had after work plans or took a cranky pill but one this is clear- she should NOT be behind the bar at This or any other decent restaurant!  She has a very bright future down at the DMV however.  Thanks for trying to kill our evening Ms Sunshine!"""
"1,""I used to LOVE this restaurant, but after some recent experiences, I plan to take my business elsewhere.\n\nTheir service remains excellent, but food quality has seriously soured.  I ordered the Chinese Chicken salad (chicken on the side since I am vegetarian), which they accommodated.  My mom and I split this along with a side of french fries.  The salad used to be so big I could eat and eat and eat and not make a dent.  We devoured this one quickly.  The carrots are in chunks instead of shredded and there are too many tortilla strips.  The greens are even lighter in color and less crunchy.  My mom enjoyed the chicken and the amount they provided.\n\nThe fries were disappointing.  They have changed the potatoes so they are much chunkier (not the shoestring yumminess it used to be) and the flavor is more comparable to fast food than to anything worth of a seated restaurant.  I didn't even eat them and decided to fill up at home instead.  Our server did take the fries off the bill after we mentioned how different they were.  We were told that they were changed for quality, but I am positive it must be a cost issue.\n\nI would go to the bar for a glass of wine as I still like the ambiance and service, but the food is not up to par anymore.  I have other restaurants that are tastier."""
"1,""Bought a hat and some other things.  Got home and discovered that the hat was rung up twice, not such a good deal after all.\nCame back with the receipt showing the double charge and the surly manager explains they would have to check their surveillance video, etc., all for $7.\nWe'll not be back."""

"2,""Stayed there for a few days for work and had a great time. \n\nPros - Nice rooms, super friendly staff (except the man in the gift shop who was strange and kind of rude), food was excellent in the restaurant, Starbucks onsite and of course, the outdoor hot tubs.\n\nCons - There's not really much around the resort except for other resorts.\n\nAs I was there for work, I didn't pay for it so couldn't say whether it was good value or not."""
"1,""Beautiful pools are the only thing going for this place.  The reception staff is slow and not especially friendly. The rooms are drab.  In a resort, I expect atmosphere and a sense of place. There was none. The fruit basket I preordered for delivery at check in was never delivered. The availability of service at the restaurant and bar were spotty at best and again not very friendly. Weddings are the priority here and twice during my stay, the staff put me aside so brides could walk in front of me at the reception desk to be served first. \n\nOn the last night of my stay I came home after a full day out to find my room door ajar. The room was serviced in my absence and one of the staff had not taken the care to properly close my door. My room faced a parking lot and busy Scottsdale Ave. I reported this and got assurances that no one had ever had anything stolen from their room before. Fortunately I did not have anything stolen. \n\nI had prepaid for late check out on arrival. On my final day, I returned to my room to find my room keys had been deactivated at the normal check out time. I went to the desk to get them reactivated. Even though the front desk verbally confirmed my late check out when I first arrived and registered, that had now mysteriously disappeared. The room key cards were fixed and I returned to my room to find an un-uniformed staff member milling around my room. She didn't even greet me. Instead she glared at me and barked \""""when are you leaving?\"""".

"1,""There are so many reasons to give this Bashas only one star (or less).  My first complaint is the lack of staffing either available, or willing to help.  Rarely do they have more than one or two aisles open for checkout, and even the self service checkout is run by one of the cashiers inconveniently located at the single open checkout lane.  Therefore, anyone checking out in self service that has (1) any alcoholic beverages, (2) any coupons, (3) has to input their phone number for their Bashas \""""rewards\"""" because they don't have their card with them ,(4) wants to pay by check, (5) has fruit/vegetables that don't show up on the screen as options, (6) well....you get the point - ALL have to wait for the cashier to leave their station to come re-instate your checkout after it's been frozen by the automated system.  In addition, this morning I ran into Bashas on my way to work for my staple morning Diet Coke, and EVERY lane (including all of the self checkout lanes) was roped off except one.  There were no less than 6 people in line ahead of me, all with significant groceries, and the checkout clerk (who was working at the speed of molassas) didn't call for additional assistance until 4 more people joined the line behind me.  And even then, no one came to help.  \n\nIn addition to the terrible (and terribly slow) service, the location of products on occasion mystifies me.  Why is the canned tuna located in the Asian section?  Why are tortillas located at the end of the chip aisle (rather than the Mexican section?)  The don't even CARRY Truffle Oil!  \n\nThe only thing I really like about this Bashas is it's cool wine chiller.  Place a room temperature bottle of wine in the chiller for no more than 4 minutes, and you're ready to join your party with a perfectly chilled Chardonnay.

I like having a smaller canvas of grocery aisles sometimes....not every store needs to be SUPERsize....but this store is right down the street from a Safeway, a Wal-Mart SuperStore, and a Fry's....these stores all have way more variety and efficient systems and employees. It's just my humble opinion, but if I can get in and out of a 22-aisle market faster than a 14-aisle market, there is something worth looking into by the management."""
"1,""This store is right near our house, so I run in often.  It's pretty lacking in the features of a grocery store:\n\n- service is terrible - the cashiers are super slow, confused and sometimes disheveled.  \n- the self-checkout machines have an issue just about every time.  i use these everywhere i can, typically with great success....and the attendant is usually nowhere to be found.  When they finally arrive, they're confused and slow.  \n- the selection is paltry - they have pretty obvious things but don't expect many brand choices, options, etc.\n- the prices are a bit steep, compared to bigger, nicer stores, plus they don't seem to have a lot of sale items\n- the produce is pretty terrible.  the guy who works in that department will cheerfully help you pick a pineapple, though.\n\nIn summary, if you don't live just down the street, avoid this place."""
"1,""THEY MADE QUACKING-TALK TO MUCH HAND GESTURES TO MY FACE!\n   \nI took my cashmere wool blend coat to Celebrity Drycleaners.  Because of the cashmere blend, I specifically asked for a quote on the item.  The quote was reasonable, upon my return to pick up the coat I was charged double what I was quoted.    I was told there was no way they quoted me that price and they called me a liar.\n  \nIt was so rude, the other customers in the store started to argue for me (thank goodness for good people sticking up for each other).\n  \nWhen I continued to try and get the quoted price, the counter person made the gesture with her hands, like a duck quacking (the gesture you make when someone is talking too much).   Wow!  I called her out on that!   It was so rude.  \n\nWhen I asked to talk to the owner, the lady suddenly didn't understand english.  Then, after finally understanding the word \""""owner\"""" said she was the owner.  What a joke!\n  \nI filed a compliant with the Better Business Bureau.

"2,""The first time that I visited Scottsdale, I stayed here only because they were hosting the convention I was attending.  They have two large swimming pools, the rooms are nice, and they have free WiFi, which lately seems to be rare in more expensive hotels.  Why can I get free WiFi at the Super 8 Motel in Ogallala, Nebraska, but not the Logan Airport Hilton in Boston?  But I digress...\n\nA good, hot breakfast is served each morning with options like made-to-order breakfast burritos and more traditional fare.  The staff is also helpful in recommending local restaurants and attractions."""
"2,""What an amazing hotel! The complimentary breakfasts rock, the rooms are spacious and just perfect! Our room had an awesome side view of camelback from the balcony and the quiet environment was the best. Though it was quite chilly to go swimming, I do regret not swimming in their heated pools during my stay. I would definitely stay here again!"""
"2,""Chaparral Suites have big rooms that work great for a family of four. We stayed in a double queen and the pull out couch in the living area was nice for the kids to have separated beds. The rooms are on the older side but the entire hotel has lots of character. There is plenty poolside space to lay about.\nWe also enjoyed the cooked breakfast in the morning and the complimentary drinks in the evening. Looking forward to returning soon."""
"2,""It's definitely a good place to stay if you are in Scottsdale. It about a 15-20 minute walk to Fashion Square. It's also close to Old Town. \n\nWe were able to get good savings from hotels.com. I have seen Living Social offers so discounts so there are other ways to get discounts. We were able to save quite a bit of money since the hotel offered a free shuttle to and from the airport. They also offered free hot breakfast that was made to order. There was happy hour from 5:30-7:30 pm. \n\nOur room included a living room, kitchenette, two TVs, and an additional sink in the bedroom. The additional sink was great for my aunt and I especially when we needed to get ready at the same time. \n\nThere is also a Dollar Rent A Car on site. Renting a car is easy, and they do offer an AMEX discount. Concierge was very helpful as they booked our Sedona tour prior to our arrival. Some of the front desk staff were more friendlier and nicer than others. \n\nUnfortunately, the place especially the courtyard area did not look as pretty as the pictures. Although the rooms are nice and clean, I agree with other Yelpers that it does need a renovation. \n\nI recommend this hotel if you are not going to be on site the majority of the time and for the great amenities. Otherwise, if I had the money, then I would stay at resort."""
"2,""Sure the place is a giant gimmick, but its a fun gimmick and for what it is they do it well enough.  The food is what you would expect from a diner and it really isn't bad at all.  My boyfriend loves the shakes, I can't do much ice cream so I haven't had one.  On certain days of the week they have awesome deals for kid's meals.  One other thing that impressed me about 5 & Diner was found on their website.  First they have all of their nutritional information available, but even more impressive is they have a menu for Gluten free choices as well as Lactose free choices.  Very cool in my opinion."""
"2,""I'm sitting here right now enjoying my country fried chicken! Its really yummy. The gravy is also very tasty. This vanilla mr. Pibb is vanilla as vanilla can be. Im all around pleased. The service is good, food is good and the ambiance hits the diner feel spot on."""
"2,""My family and I have lived here for almost 3 years now, and we are staying put for a while. \n\nThe community is small, but we love that about Miramonte. Most neighbors are very friendly, and the grounds are always kept tidy. The pool area is beautiful and very relaxing, offering a fire pit and cabanas. We love swimming as often as we can! The fitness room may be small, but it gives you enough to sweat and burn. \n\nThe neighbors, most anyway, are always friendly. Parking is never a problem, in the 3 years we've been there, only twice has our parking spot been taken. When it is, we ask nicely for it to be moved and it gets moved. \n\nMaintenance is incredible, super quick and very friendly. The front office staff is also very friendly and helpful. \n\nWe have a small dog and 4 year old, and we love it here. It's the perfect little place for us, and we recommend it to anyone. We do face Hayden road, but noise isn't too bad. In the mornings, you can sometimes here the band at Saguaro high school play, and i'm sure the neighbors facing Pueblo elementary hear the giggles, screams, and running of small kiddos, but other than that we have no complaints!"""

"2,""One of my favorite breakfast & lunch spots since I moved to Arizona. I can't say enough good things about this place. The owners are wonderful and the food even better.

"2,""Probably not a destination you would visit unless you worked here or wanted to have a business meeting and thats the kind of people you run into here.  Beautiful business people.  I met a friend just to check out the baked goods and try the coffee.\n\nIt's really a full dining experience with a breakfast and lunch menu that look delicious.  I got to spy some of the lunch items heading out for catering and they looked fab!\n\nCoffee and baked goods were good but I think I spent as much in parking fees as I did in coffee.\n\nStaff is probably the only questionable factor here.  Manager was correcting them loudly in eating area which seemed very unprofessional.  Good workers are hard to find.\n\nThanks Romancing you do a great job!"""
"2,""Amazing!  Hidden jewel of Tempe and wonderful people!"""
"2,""Great location, lots of gas pumps. \n\nEasy to get in-and-out of: right off the 101, about 30 seconds west of the freeway.\n\nI only go to Chevron and this is where I go besides the one on Scottsdale Rd and Bell."""
"2,""Needed a quick bite in Scottsdale so I used the Yelp app and swung by this place.  I was a little taken aback by the location but once we got inside, it was nothing but goodness.  We had the pizza hoagie with potato salad.  Amazing.  The potato salad was nice and tangy with no celery, just the way I like it.  The pizza hoagie came with a generous amount of cheese and delicious tomato sauce.\n\nStaff was super friendly and helpful.  Definitely a keeper.\n\nCash only!"""
"1,""I think a more appropriate name for this restaurant should be \""""The Disappointing Egg\"""", as I was very disappointed in my meal. I got a veggie omelet that was supposed to include broccoli among other vegetables. The \""""broccoli\"""" in my omelet was literally a pinch of broccoli scraps that you might find at the bottom of the bag. It was mostly onion, which is a pretty big cop-op for an overpriced omelet. Granted, this was my first time here, so bear that in mind w/me review, this experience has lead me to not want to come back. I found it to be a waste of time, money, and calories."""
"1,""Prices are way high for a breakfast place. Over 25 dollars for two adults. Cute atmosphere, but the food, which sounded unique and delicious on the menu, did not live up to the talk. Super disappointed."""
"1,""Bad from the start. Dirty silverware, really dirty table. The waitress seemed bothered that I asked her to wipe the table down. The food either over or under cooked.

"2,""Decent breakfast and service. Cute little restaurant. The fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing!"""
"1,""We used to come here when I was a kid-so recently on a visit to AZ we tried it out again. Not bad-it was weird that there was a special \""""only if you pay extra\"""" section of the salad bar that had the good stuff like chicken and artichoke hearts for a few extra bucks, but it ended up not mattering because we went for the 2 meals for 20 dollars route.\nIt was fine-and the Greek Lemon soup was actually good. We were there right before it closed and a person working there gave us each a bag of chocolate chip cookies for free at the end of the night. That was nice."""
"1,""Its a salad buffet....thats it! It's boring.  It's clean, good service, but its not exciting."""
"2,""So I'm sure like most guys this is not a place you would want to spend a Friday or Saturday night at a theater..... But it was date-night with the Girl and I saw there was Hairspray showing at this theater. Once again not how i want to spend a weekend night but I know my GF and she loooooves that musical. So being the good guy I am I got tickets. \n    I was expecting to go and sleep through the show and call it a night......however once the lights went down and the show started I was blown away! The cast was awesome there were no mess ups and everyone was on key. I really enjoyed myself, everyone was enthusiastic and professional the guy playing the mother was fantastic and it was all around a great time. I am for sure going to make this a date-night staple from now on..... Hope they bring the Producers soon."""
"1,""I really enjoyed shopping here until yesterday.  Everyone is always helpful all over the store and even at check out when they thank you by name.\n\nI was picking up some Ranger IPA on my way home and Serena was at the check out counter.

"1,""My boyfriend and I are visiting from San Diego and were looking for a good happy hour.  The two-for-ones brought us to this place.  The vibe seemed pretty good, the music was pretty good but the people watching was actually the best.  The bartender staff were pretty wild and seemed to be having a great time.  There was also a speed dating event going on - pretty \""""40 year old virgin\"""" ish.  \n\nThis is an interesting crowd as there were a number of guys with shaved heads - is that an Arizona thing or is it symbolic of something else?   The crowd demographics are either young or old and not much in between.  \n\nThe appetizer food that looked good on line sucked!  Although cheap, you got what you paid for.  We had crab cakes, chicken wings, calamari rings and french fries.  French fries were way over cooked and too brown"
"1,""I know I won't get any freebies on this review but who cares. Truth is more valuable.\nI dropped in last night. It was the cheeziest get together I've ever experienced.  Filled with people who don't know how to socialize, sad faces abounded, appeared to be a park and swap gig with cheap jewelry on tables for sale.!   The way 90% of these patrons were dressed, astonished me! OMG. Cheap cheap and quack quack!  I should of known hwen I noticed the cars in the parking lot, I've not  seen  so many old cars and trucks, since  I attending the Park and Swap experience. The drinks (wine) is so bad, you can expect to spend most your time 'later"

"2,""Love Shane Co! My fianc\u00e9 surprised me with the most beautiful ring from here and the diamond is absolutely gorgeous! The ring was a little loose, so we took it in (which is kind of far from us) and they were able to resize it and polish it all in one visit :) Over all, we've been very pleased with our experience at Shane Co!"""
"2,""I was very happy with my sales person and my purchase. They were not high pressure  and the ring and diamond I purchased were a higher quality and better price than other places I had been. \n\nIt doesnt stop there either, the  warranty plan we recieved was FREE and does not require us to bring the ring in at scheduled intervals to keep the warranty valid (Other stores charged for warranty plans and required the item be brought in every 6 months for a cleaning and checkup to keep the warranty valid) . After about 2 years my wife noticed one of the smaller stones had fallen out so I took the ring back and they replaced the stone no questions asked. Also we can take it back at anytime for a cleaning. \n\nI would highly recommend anyone to at least visit Shane Co. when they are looking for any jewlery item."""
"2,""The staff is very friendly. The rooms while a little dated are clean. Every room has a mini refrig, microwave and coffee maker, a big plus in my eyes, I love every morning you can go and enjoy a lovely free breakfast inside or out on the deck or even back at your room. At Night they have fresh coffee and cookies if you are looking for a snack, \nThe hotel is well located to shopping and night life. This is the only place I will stay when I come to Scottsdale,"""
"2,""A decent little nail salon that I go to if the place I regularly attended is way too busy. The ladies (and the guy) are really nice and its never really busy  (at least when I go) and the only reason I don't go their more is because its just a little bit more expensive. Not by much, but I just have a great rapport at the other place as I have been going their longer.  If you are in the area, check out China Nails. They will definitely take good care of you."""
"2,""I went back for the Wednesday night wine class and had the pleasure of enjoying the company of Donald S. and the Beautiful Carin for my visit. \n\nThis event is informative and fun for singles, couples or small groups. $15 per person gets you generous pours, a bottle of water (to cleanse your palate) and a meat and cheese tray for the table. \n\nEveryone tastes each wine at the same time and each wine is introduced by the distributor/representative who explains the terroir, process distinctions or  trivia about the wine maker.  A great opportunity to learn what you like and don't like about wine, but not pretentious. We were able to enjoy short conversations in between explanations. \n\nReservations are strongly suggested but can be made the day before the event, depending on the size of your group."""
"1,""I do not recommend this school. I was extremely dissatisfied with the school's inflexible policies, the communication rendered by employees, and the effects enrollment there had on my child.\n\n1) Incompetent Care\nThe entire time my three year old attended, she had a rash on her rear, as they did not wipe her properly when she used the bathroom. Three year old's need assistance in getting cleaned up after they go potty - this is daycare 101. As soon as my child would come home, her rash would clear up - then return during the next week at school. I spoke to the employees at the school about this on several occasions and nothing was done to correct the problem.\n\n2) Forced Naps\nTwo hours out of the five my daughter attended Scottsdale Academy daily, the children were required to nap. No provision was made for children who don't nap (mine just happens to be one of those kids who don't). They are not even allowed to quietly read or draw - they are forced to lie there. Failing to provide an option for a quiet activity / assuming all children fit one mold is simply bad childcare.\n\n3) Inflexible Policies\nThis school requires that you pick up your child at a certain time, regardless of what time you drop them off. For every five minutes you are late, they charge you $5.00. They are completely inflexible about this regulation, even for moms who have other kids to pick up across town after school. Because of this rule, I was forced to pick up my little girl at 2 PM before the other after-school pick-ups I needed to make, thus reducing the amount of time she was spending at Scottsdale Academy. They would do nothing to modify their fees to compensate for this, and were completely unwilling to make adjustments based on actual hourly attendance. It's as if they do not want your business!  Interesting business model - I imagine attrition is high at this school. I know I was only too happy to withdraw my child. (By the way, they don't refund any of your money when you withdraw.)\n\n4) Communication Problems\nThe daycare workers at Scottsdale Academy do not communicate with parents about the daily experiences/progress of their children. A slip of paper is provided at the end of the day telling parents that the child napped or did not, ate or did not, and what project was completed. No other information is shared - nothing about social interactions, milestones, problems, or other pertinent issues. When I arrived to pick up my child, everyone there acted as if they were too busy to stop and talk to me."""
"2,""As a person who regularly stays at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I consider 5 stars a big deal.  I stayed here, with my mom, for one night before staying 2 nights at said Ritz-Carlton, and I was upset that I didn't stay here the entire time.  The rooms at this resort far exceeded my expectations.  It's usually a timeshare type of place, so the full kitchen and separation of the bedroom was expected, but the enormous and luxurious bathroom was not.  I mean, the tub can easily fit two people AND has jets, and the shower is big enough to have a decent-sized party in!  Also, the sofa has a pull out, so the rooms are very accomadating.  This is by far the best place I've ever stayed in the Phoenix-Metro area.  I have a 3-night stay booked for the first weekend in September, and I can't wait!"""
"2,""Efficiency condo but roomy, with louvered doors to shut off bedroom, and bed very comfortable.  No full kitchen as advertised and no ice-maker.  Free Wi-Fi!  Set-up a little strange but nice:  you park your car and a bellman takes you to your room in a golf cart!  Nice to have someone load and unload but of course that involved a tip!  Sometimes parking involves a long walk back to your car.  Nice young men James and Josh very friendly and helpful as bell men.  Nice outdoor porch, but almost got a haircut from a stray golf ball!  Pool and hot tub roomy and nice.  Roomy jacuzzi tub with large window.  Windows have blinds between glass that are difficult to black out.  Shower nice but at times hot water took a while to come up.  Would stay here again!"""
"2,""Fun place for groups! Benihana wouldn't be my first choice for sushi or for going out at all really, but if you have a special occasion for some friends it would be a good place to consider. Pricey food, but I thought it was good. Haven't tried the sushi yet. \n\nBenihana is known for it's tables which are centered around a stove. You get your own chef who comes over and prepares your whole meal for you! They do lots of crazy tricks and entertain the table while cooking. Lots of fire tricks too! \n\nIt's the kind of place you can say you have been to and it"
"1,""As you can probably tell by my other reviews-- I'm one of those, \""""if you don't have something nice to say....yadda yadda yadda.\""""  But in the spirit of Yelp and actual critical review--- I'll have to suggest steering clear of Benihana"

The garbage can next to our table was full and was dirty.

They weren't any less precious or savory. \n\nIt's a restaurant where it's hard to recommend one dish over another because of the uniform excellence, so have whatever appeals to you, and don't be afraid to try something new, because it will surprise you with just how good it is.  You will become convinced that it is one of the very best restaurants in the state. \n\nThey've got a tarte tatin, which is a sort of french apple cake-tart, served with cream that has just the slightest, most surprising and delicious hint of brie in it.

"2,""We were feeling courageous on a Friday night at 6pm to try and have dinner here, as it had been a while.  \n\nWe were lucky to get in right away, as there is usually a wait of about 30 minutes.  \n\nWe were seated and promptly served warm bread and drinks.  Our waitress was on top of it and she was pleasant, even though the restaurant was PACKED. \n\nThe app of grilled artichokes were brought out and about 10 minutes later our food.  The food is always good and generous portion sizes and reasonably priced.\n\nThe bf had the BBQ chicken pizza, which is always amazing but this time was especially good by his comments.\n\nI enjoyed the lettuce wrapped chicken tacos (asian).  \n\nOverall, this experience was as good as it usually is.  The only downside is the restaurant is always very VERY loud and table space is very small if you are not seated in a booth (we were not).\n\nFor a chain restaurant, this restaurant, especially this location is worth it."""
"2,""I love the food at cheesecake factory. I can't go there often though because they don't have organic non chemicalized products. If they had non GMO chicken and organic salads i would be back.

Cheesecake factory should offer a non GMO menu for people who would pay a little less for food that is healthy."""

"1,""Today was my last visit. The customer service is consistently poor and in a day and age where the average consumer has a multitude of meal options in front of them, what really sets places apart is how they interact with patrons.

"1,""Stopped in here for a quick bite around 2PM on a weekday. Had the chicken wrap, which when it arrived had obviously been microwaved and possessed no discernible pieces of chicken. A lot of sauce and warm gooey fried muck made up the rest of the interior of the wrap, although the lettuce and tomatoes seemed okay for the couple of bites I took. The coleslaw (side) seemed fresh and was enjoyable since that was all I got to enjoy this day. Save your $8...unless you like a cup of overpriced coleslaw.

"1,""What a disappointment! \n\nWent tonight with wife and our 11-month old daughter, looking forward to giving a locally-owned store some business and picking a special present for our little gal. \n\nGreat selection of toys, cute store, lots of interesting things right inside the door. However, after 20 minutes, no-one had acknowledged us, said hello, offered assistance ... nothing. This despite the owners and two young employees were walking around and only 1-2 other customers were in the store. -2 stars.\n\nAsked the gal behind the counter if we could open an item for our daughter to try it out. This would have required removing 2-3 pieces of tape, but no - not possible. -1 star.\n\nBut the straw that really broke the old camel's back came when we were offered to sign up for their mailing list. Members of the list get a little birthday gift every year. Great, we thought - our daughter's birthday is two days away. Alas, \""""she'll have to wait till next year\"""" because store policy dictated a few more days notice! Say what? Yep, \""""wait till next year\"""" we were told again. -more stars than I can deduct!!!\n\nSo we took our $50 purchase and left disappointed with no plans to return. Even Buy Buy Baby has 10x better customer service, greets you, offers assistance (sometimes even too much), but a mom & pop store can't even say hello and welcome, or see the awkwardness in denying a birthday gift to a first customer who could have become a regular for the next 10 years? \n\nHello and goodbye, Kidstop.

I have never stayed at a resort where the maids come past 3-4, let alone that late. Our room got cleaned once in 4 days. Terrible customer service. So hard to get ahold of anyone while staying here. Left countless messages that went unreturned. Set up cabana at pool and let concierge know I would have guests weeks in advance via email. Day of they told me I had a limit. Almost Ruined birthday party. Pretty much Ruined our stay as it pissed me off beyond comprehension. I was forced to talk to multiple different managers delaying start of festivities. Finally I had to pay for another room that I didn't need to get everyone in. All could have been solved with  clear communication from beginning on their part. Food sucks on top of that. Too many good options in this area to deal with the garbage customer service and nickel and diming guests who plan to spend thousands here over one weekend. My experience at this hotel has soured me on the entire westin and Starwood brand. People come to resorts to relax and have fun. My stay here has been anything but due to them putting me through the ringer and trying to squeeze every last dollar out of me. Avoid at all costs."""

There is a golf course, tennis court, swimming pool, hot tub, fitness center, shuttle to the small shopping center, gift shop,  bar and during the summer this have this complex water park open during the day only. This resort made my stay wonderful.  Nice views of the golf course which I find odd, but sure. Everyone was attentive towards requests.  I wanted to see how long the walk would be to Scottsdale quarter and they offered to call up the shuttle driver to take me there.  It was a nice drive through the lanes,  as it would have taken me ten minutes to walk there.  I did walk be to the hotel in ten minutes, so the attractions aren't far from the resort.   One setback is depending on where your room is relative to the lobby you might be giving yourself a self guided tour of the resort.  It spans a huge area.  \n\nI was there during December so I got to see the 3D holiday paint scaping lightshow during dinner. Very clever and unexpecting for a place like this.  For those who were staying in the rooms where the lights were going to shine through, they got a friendly door knock to close their blinds for the show :) It created a nice christmas touch to the season."""

He said they had to use only oil their computer tells them to use.  \n\nI chucked them the deuces  and peaced out.  Drove up the road to Jiffy Lube on Shea and was greeted with awesome service.  I even pulled a coupon from their website which expired 12/31/13 yet they said they will take any coupon expired or not, for anyone.

"2,""As soon as I walked into Arrivederci in Scottsdale, I felt welcomed.\n\nThe cute, bustling Italian restaurant was cozy but elegant, with lots of chatter and linen-covered tables, and the staff at the door and servers were super-friendly. The spot is locally owned, with a second location in Ahwatukee, and my pal and I got a nice table in the corner of the restaurant to enjoy the homemade Italian food at.\n\nWe both liked how there were wine racks dividing the main dining area from the bar area, and there were pretty paintings covering the walls, while the restaurant glowed in a soft yellow light. Our server was excellent and professional, and I'd say it's a great date place if you're in the area.\n\nWe started with the Portobello Reganato con Fontina ($8.95), a mushroom topped with cheese. Our server said it was one of their most popular appetizers, and I can see why: it was plenty of food for two people to split and had a ton of cheese. The mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nOur meals came with freshly baked bread, and I ordered Ravioli Caprese Gratinati ($14.95). It was a pretty traditional cheese ravioli, and nothing really stood out to me about the dish, though my companion really liked the fresh tomato sauce it was smothered in. The pasta was thick but a great consistency-there wasn't anything wrong with it, but I've just had more memorable meals.\n\nMy guest got the Vitello Madeira con Porcini ($18.95), which was veal covered in a mushroom wine sauce and served with pasta. He said he would have preferred a cream sauce instead, which is totally available to you, but he really liked the veal.\n\nFor dessert, we had the epic chocolate tiramisu the spot offered. It was a giant slab of my favorite dessert, and it tasted pretty heavenly. Definitely get it if you go here-I could have eaten the whole thing myself!\n\nMy favorite part about dining at Arrivederci was definitely the atmosphere and the service. I love places that make you feel at home, and Arrivederci certainly does that with zero pretentiousness from the staff, and I also appreciated the casual elegance vibe the place had. Not to mention, I'm still dreaming of that dessert."""

It was a $5 cover to hear the house band, which was no biggy and then I asked for a diet coke which was another $3. Again, no problem paying for the diet coke. After about 30 minutes and some dancing, I went up to the bar for a refill of the diet coke expecting the refill to be free. The bartender told me it would be another $3. I mentioned that I was the responsible one for a table full of people drinking and that I thought the point was not to encourage drunk driving and to encourage people being responsible. Well that got me nowhere so I asked for a glass of water instead. I was told that the bartender couldn't give me water because it was a two drink minimum to get water.\n\nNow it's July in AZ and I had been dancing. We had a table full of people drinking and ordering their drinks from this same bartender who can't give me a glass of WATER. Really?

"1,""Total RIP OFF. I went into the store for a price quote on a new motor and some replacement cartridges and they gave me a reasonable price but when I called them to come out to do the work they charged me an extra  15% on the cartridges then what they had quoted they would cost. The repair man also did not bring the replacement motor that was ordered so he could charge me for an extra 45 minutes while he drove back to the store to get the motor he had forgotten. I was also told that the new motor would come with a new pump housing in the original quote which it did not. When I called to ask the manager about the pricing he was immediately standoffish and hostile. I couldn't believe that they treat their customers this poorly. The repairman had done about  25 minutes  of work and they charged me 210.00 dollars in labor alone not to mention a price increase of about 15% for all the parts quoted. For about 50 more bucks I could have replaced the entire system. I would advise anyone looking to have their pool serviced to go else where and avoid this dishonest company."""

He came back in to grab me since his oil change was done and the sales associate asked me, \""""What are you looking for? Or are you just looking.\"""" in a tone that suggested I wasn't welcome.

Mine came with a breadlike object on top and when questioned, he said, it's a cracker stick, like that was okay. When I picked up the bowl and handed it back to him, he started to remove the crumbly stick, like that would now make my contaminated salad gluten free. Then, the crumbs fell into my daugher's Caprese salad, so both had to be reordered. My daughter's dish was not correct, nor was her pasta side, so they remade the pasta. Gluten free pasta cannot be al dente, but this was. I found a piece of non gluten free pasta mixed in with mine, leading me to suspect they make the gluten free with the regular pasta. Dirty dishes were not removed in a timely manner nor were water glasses filled. Just an odd, outdated place. Felt like I was back in Jersey, without the good food."""
"1,""I recently visited La Torretta while spending the weekend in Scottsdale. \nService here is great, but everything else about this restaurant is horrible.\n\nWe arrived at 9pm for our dinner reservation there were 4 other tables in the restaurant. We were seated promptly. Our waiter was attentive, comical, and polite. \nWe opted out of appetizers and went straight for entrees. Our food took forever to arrive. We waited about 40 mins for our dinner to arrive. I ordered the halibut special which came with a lemon artichoke/capers sauce with a side of ravioli, and steamed veggies. The halibut was a bit dry and the sauce was not good. It tasted like it came from a can. We also ordered the Lasagna al Saltimbocca. The description reads (Baked hand made wide ribbon pasta with ragu of wild mushrooms, veal and prosciutto) Regrettably, it ended up being regular lasagna with ground beef. There were no mushrooms, no veal, and no prosciutto. \n\nThe worst part of the dining experience was the bill. The halibut was $35 and the lasagna was $22. Frankly, you can get better Italian food at Maggiano's. The great service doesn't justify the overpriced food. Don't waste your hard earned cash at La Torretta."""
"1,""The first thing you notice is the smell.   If I hadn't have been starving, I would have walked out.   The place is dark and dreary, with a wait staff to match.  Clearly they have their own little dramas going on that trump customer service.  But to be fair, they do all call you \""""sweetie\"""" and \""""honey\""""  once they get around to showing up, there's the consolation. My meal came fairly quickly, so no complaints there.\n\nThe food was actually decent.  I had the smoked whitefish salad appetizer, which was a nice plate for a single diner like myself.   The platter included a nice helping of whitefish salad, cream cheese,  lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, capers, olives and pickles along with a toasted bagel.   The salad was very smoky and  tasty, and everything seemed fresh except for the olives, which were very strange and mushy.\n\nThe problem with trying to eat in a place that smells so bad and looks so dirty is that it's hard to get past all of that to really enjoy the food.  I just kept wondering what state the kitchen was in.   So, despite the decent food, I have to give this place a two star rating.   Maybe call Robert Irvine!   Unless it's freshened up and the smell is gone, I'm not going back.  Not even for such good whitefish salad!"""
"2,""My Husband and I took my Grandma to Ristorante Giuseppe this evening.  Since it was a weeknight after a storm there was practically no one there, which was fine by me since I already knew this place could get crowded (based on other yelp reviews).  My Husband and I shared the one of the pasta specials, which was baked ziti with all sorts of meats.  It was creamy, cheesy, meat filled goodness.  We also had a salad and garlic bread, which was also unique since it had a kick.  My Grandma had the pork parmigiana, she loved it.\n\nOverall, this is a small Mom and Pop shop and it was VERY good.  It's always nice to support great places like Ristorante Giuseppe that are family owned and have great authentic food!"""
"2,""I have only been here once, but I cannot wait to go back. My favorite part was the atmosphere. Cheesecake is awesome, the food was so authentic (no Olive Garden menu here!), and the owners even went table to table to chat with everyone. \nVery busy, but still a great experience.\nYou should try it at least once. Bring cash!"""
"1,""Decided to go here after reading the great reviews but was terribly disappointed in the service.  Waited 40 minutes for a table when for 30 of those minutes we stared at 3 empty tables just waiting for people to be sat at them- they remained empty while my party and 4 other parties waited the full 40 minutes wondering why those tables were remaining empty. \n\nWe were finally sat and waited another 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged by the server who clearly was more interested in socializing with the other staff members than with providing good customer service to his tables. We finally placed our order after flagging down the server via another employee. We then waited another 45 minutes for our food before the waiter returned and blamed the delay on something that was \""""beyond his control\"""" and it would be another few minutes,\n\nWe were so annoyed at this point that we told the manager to just box the food up and we would take it to go. To their credit they were apologetic and even threw in 2 free desserts. However, the damage was already done. I guess I would give this place one more chance only because of the great Yelp reviews but I would make for darn sure that we do not get the same waiter with his head in his ass. We ate the food in our hotel room (we are from out of state) is was pretty decent."""
"1,""Traditional 70's style Italian-American food in a strip mall mainly notable because you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee.  Don't believe the hype - this place is nothing special.\n\nContrary to the many reviews here that comment on how cheap it is, I found it a bit expensive for what you're getting, which is not exactly nuova cucina.  $15.95 for two small (non-homemade) cannelloni a la carte is not a bargain in my book.  Their linguine with white clam sauce is some canned clams tossed with a copious amount of oil (1/2 a cup perhaps) and some boxed pasta for $12.95.  The $9.95 \""""insalata Romana\"""" is a plate of tired iceberg lettuce, a tomato wedge or two, and a few shreds of bland cheese swimming in a very tart vinaigrette.   \n\nThis is the kind of food that used to represent Italian food in America before the food revolution of the 80's.  The kind of place you'd find, not in New York or Chicago, but in Terre Haute or Tampa at a time when \""""eye-talian\"""" food was still considered a bit exotic.\n\nThe many reviews stating that this is \""""real homemade Italian food\"""" are a bit puzzling since it's neither homemade nor Italian.  This is very old-fashioned pre-foodie Italian-American food and while it's OK for what it is, it certainly isn't \""""real Italian\"""" food by any stretch of the imagination nor is it, for the most part, homemade.  \n\nN.B. No, a visit to this restaurant is not \""""just like going to Italy.\""""  For that matter, it's not just like going to Little Italy.  I realize Phoenix is not exactly a mecca for italian food, but WTF people!  \n  \nThe mostly 60+ crowd seems to love it.  I can only guess that they are overwhelmed by nostalgia for a simpler time, because while it may not be Kierland pretentious nor a crappy chain restaurant, the food just isn't very good.  Seriously. \n\nThe servers have a strange attitude that I guess is supposed to be \""""east-coast\"""" or something (rushed, cocky, borderline rude) but seems a bit out of place in what is basically a mom and pop strip mall joint serving canned food with plastic red checked tablecloths and thin paper napkins.  In any case, they are very selective with their attention and you can wait quite a while to get something.\n\nAlso, as several other reviewers have pointed out, they give you a non-itemized bill with just the total due written on it which seems to include an extra 10% or so with no explanation offered.   This seems quite bizarre to me but apparently no one objects.  At this restaurant, $15.95 + $12.95 + $9.95 somehow add up to $45.65.  The non-itemized bill is a weird affectation at best - why would you do that, especially in a cheap joint like this?  But to do that and then mis-calculate?  There's a word for that in Italian - it's imbrogliare. \n\n$54 for two with tip for a simple shared salad and two pasta dishes with no meat and no drinks."""
"1,""Had dinner there Sunday evening.  I have been in the valley 12 years, and this is the worst food that I have ever been served.  A piece of veal that was most  likely left over from Friday or Satuday night.  They probably put it in the microwave.  It could not be cut with a knife, dried out, a grease ball.  They should not serve dreck like that, and charge you for it.  The waiter looked, as far as clean hands, like he just finished doing the yard work there.  A shame that we wasted so much money on a horrible dinner.  Even the pasta they served on the side was total grease.  They took away the large salad we ordered that was half eaten without even asking.   That was rude.\n\nI realize it was a Sunday evening, but, please, do not serve such inferior food, and please wear a clean outfit if you are going to serve the public food.  I will never go back there, and will let my friends know what a horrible experience we had."""
"1,""I found black hair in my meatball sandwich(I'm blonde), when I confronted the owner he said \""""that's possible\"""". Extremely disgusting and rude! Didn't even take the sandwich off the bill. Also they only take cash here. Wonder why? Don't go here, unless you like eating hair."""

"1,""It's a great place to get your teeth worked on.  However, give it about a few months and then you receive a bill in the mail for some balance, even though you paid in full when you were there.  Now, the explanation was that due to the insurance not covering some minimal amount, making it worth it to ruin a good reputation by sending me a bill 5-6 months after.  The lady on the phone said that I just paid the estimate, and not the actual amount.  So why would this place misquote their customers?  I've been to a few dentists, and never has this happened to me, where I paid in full after the procedure was done, and then get another bill 5-6 months later.  Unbelievable.  Even though the dentist does great work on teeth for what you came in for, be careful of additional recommendations for extra($$$) work as it is not necessary to get right away(ex. root canal, crown, etc.),that's if your teeth don't hurt.  Am I going to be looking for a new dentist?  Mostly like yes, until this place gets their billing straightened out.  Remember, I wasn't looking for a freebie, as I paid over $500 to that place, the 5-6 months later bill was minimal, but it's the principal that counts."""

The decor was very pretty as well. In the morning we got free breakfast that serves from 6-10am. Their breakfast was beyond what we were expecting. Very delicious with bacon, eggs, bagels, etc. I definitely would recommend anyone who's stopping by Scottsdale to try this hotel. Completely in love with it!

"1,""I've read the reviews before playing and got me interested.  After playing, I'm not sure what you all saw in this course.\n\nI played the North and the South on the same day in mid March as part of our annual mancation.  We paid $320 to play both courses on the same day.  Here are my thoughts.\n\nEither courses lacked any real feature.  They were flat and boring.  No elevation changes, no scenic desert scape and the holes were generally boring in design.  Just a flat course in the middle of the desert.  There are plenty of better courses in Phoenix that are cheaper and way more entertaining and challenging for much lower price (500 club, ASU Karsten, Papago, Dove Valley, etc...).  If you want to pay this kind of price and enjoy the scenery as well as challenge, try TPC Scottsdale, Ocotillo, Raven, Triology, Troon North for starter).  I'm not opposed to high green fees just as long as they provide value.\n\nOn the day of the course, the greens were rock hard and didn't hold a single ball - not even a nine iron on to the front of the green.  When we got done, none of us walked away with 'oh, what about that hole' with any enthusiasm.  For the price we paid, this was not much better than a muni track.  Sorry TalkingStick, you're just a stick.\n\nOn the positive, the staff was generally friendly and helpful.  However, the Marshall did nothing to keep the guys in front of us at pace with the group in front of them.  I suppose that's why they took the 'Marshall' tile away and gave them more benign 'player assistant' title."""

"2,""This place is ah-mazing.  It's a family-owned business and they came from LA to Arizona to setup shop.  \n\nThe sushi is so yummy.  We had Toro and a rainbow roll.  The quality of fish is excellent.  I also had the udon noodle soup which I split with my mom.  It was the perfect accompaniment to a chilly winter day.  You can split it easily, and they bring you the bowls and spoons to do so.  It even has a soft boiled egg in it! Yummy\n\nThe menu has more than standard rolls, there are a lot of fusion rolls to choose from!\n\nThey also had hot green tea that was so good.\n\nThis place is intimate and welcoming, definitely worth becoming a regular at!"""
"1,""We've tried this place several times in the past few years, and each time that we do, I end up kicking myself for giving it another shot.  I just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here!  Once again, the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best.  Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish (or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had), but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster.  We sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled.  We had some Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls, one of which was the Negi Toro roll that I had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had.  We'd actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the Maguro nigiri and were ready to leave, but as soon as we flagged down the waitress, he presented the two pieces to us, nearly a half an hour after the last roll he'd served us when the place was less than half full.\n\nI find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place.  That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant.  The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley.  Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh, high quality sushi in Scottsdale, I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade."""

"1,""12/03/12\n\nHmm... I could've sworn I had written a review of this place before.  At the very least, I uploaded a few pics of our breakfast here many months ago.  Took my Mom to try the oven-baked pancakes once.  Do yourself a favor and pass on these!  Guess the review AND photos were taken down.  (Let's see how long this NEW review sticks before it's taken down, too.)\n\nCousin texted me yesterday and asked if I'd join her for breakfast at JP Pancake today, and I texted her back guessing that it was too late to warn her not to buy the Groupon... Yes, it was.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to see if JP had improved on its service and food prep.  As you can see, it hasn't...\n\nWe arrived around 7:35 am to see a deserted parking lot with the exception of one car parked in front of JPP.  It looked like we were the only souls there, besides our server and the cook in the kitchen.  I thought perhaps we'll get better service this time, since we were the only customers.  The young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted, handed us the menus and asked if we'd like some coffee or juice to start with.  I asked for coffee, while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa.  He said he'd see if they had any in the back first.  He came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa (Swiss Miss and canned whip cream) and said he'd be back with my coffee.  Upon his return, we placed orders of a \""""Golden brown\"""" waffle ($6.25), two full orders of French toast (one with strawberries, one with bananas, $7.95 per), and two sides of bacon (3 pieces each, $3.25 per).  I later asked if the side of ham is off-the-bone, and after consulting with the cook, he came back with a \""""yes.\""""  I placed a late order of that, as well.  \n\nWhile the service was good (food arrived fast, server checked back to see how we were doing), the breakfast we had wasn't as good.  Our French toast slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA were very dry-- the menu stated challah bread, but I think it was more like cake, and the slices could've used a longer soak in the egg batter.  Out of the six halves on my cousin's plate, she only had one (and all but one of her berry slices!), while I had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter.  I would've suggested we share a plate, but she didn't want to get bananas, and I didn't want any berries...  As I've said, the only winner this morning was the waffle, and I think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success.  (Also, I brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup, since most restos offer up a non-organic cane and corn syrup blend.  My cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurant's own syrup, ditched that, and then used mine until she was finished eating.)  Their sides of bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg#OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg were very costly, considering that these were very thin slices and VERY greasy (even for bacon!).  I wouldn't hesitate paying $3.50 for a very nice plate of THICK-SLICED bacon, all-natural even, but these were pathetic-looking.  As unfortunate-looking as they were, however, they did save breakfast for my cousins.  As for the miniature slice of ham http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA#cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA I was presented with, I sent that back.  I may have been a fool to agree to waste my calories on a horrible breakfast this morning (thinking it was time to give JPP another chance for improvement), but I'm not that big a fool to allow my cousin to be charged another $3.25 for a paltry serving!\n\nAlso, zero props to our server who freaked my cousin out by hugging the wall by the kitchen with what I thought was the hope of keeping out of our vision while being able to hear our conversation without success!  Her sister confirmed seeing this behavior and thought it was very creepy, too.  I wished they'd alerted me sooner (by asking me to switch seats) so that I could see what they were talking about.  Overall, what a lousy way to spend $35* and a breakfast meal out!  :(\n\n*Original ticket was just under $45, which showed the order charges totaling under $38 before tax.  If you account for Scottsdale's food tax of 8.95%, what was the extra $3, or so, for?  A hidden tip?  Finding this hidden charge was surprising, because our server did not know we were using a Groupon.  There was a sign on the door that stipulated that all Groupon customers will be charged an 18% tip at checkout, and my cousin did not mention her Groupon until we were given the check.  Perhaps, just perhaps, JPP assumes that all of their customers are Groupon-users?  Not far-fetched, since the Yelp reviews can't be helping JPP these days..."""

Its freeking amazing!!! We haven't had a dessert at the melting pot that we didn't LOVE!"""
"2,""This is one of my absolutely favorite places to eat. Here is my guide to having a 5 star experience at this restaurant. \n\n1. Make reservations a few weeks in advance to be sure to get the time slot you are interested it. They fill up fast.\n\n2. Go for an occasion, not a holiday. Go because its your birthday, or you are celebrating a big business deal. Not on Valentines Day. This is not me saying it would be bad on Valentine's Day, but most people get frustrated when its busy at places like this and don't realize that, well, yeah...its VALENTINE'S DAY. (If you can set the right expectations then HECK YEAH go on Valentine's Day)\n\n3. DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT take your kids here. It is not that the staff wouldn't be amazing to your kids, it is the fact that most people are here for a quiet night out, not a screaming 2 year old. (I leave my screaming 2 year old at home.) Here's the catch, if your kid is old enough to enjoy a good meal and experience and you would like some one on one time with them to perhaps congratulate them on good grades etc, this may not be a bad idea. Again...screaming 2 year old = NO.\n\n4. Finding deals for this place is also a good tip. Sometimes you will see coupons in your local mailer, or you can sign up for their newsletter. If not prepare yourself for a high bill. Same as when you go to Fogo de Chao. You know you are going to a nice place, you also know you are paying for it. Go in with a good mindset and be expecting it and it wont shock you, either that or drink some of their fabulous cocktails and then you wont care!\n\n5. Booths with privacy curtains. Don't ask. However be aware that they do have them and they can be fun. (Assuming here, I have never sat in one).\n\n6. Last but not least and most important. I do not care if you are on a diet, or diabetic, or hate chocolate (what kind of nut are you). Make time, don't eat for a week, take insulin, and have the chocolate fondue. This is absolutely amazing and worth the trip every time!\n\nFollow my 6 steps and you will have a great time at The Melting Pot!"""
"1,""ok so, first of all, if i had known we had to cook our own food i never would have gone here. second of all, the cheese was good but not $16 good. the food was ok, but if you get something different from your date you still share the same pot so the flavors get all muddled. plus, the lighting is very dim in this restaurant so it was very hard for me to tell if my pork, chicken, shrimp and any other must be fully cooked foods were fully cooked. i must say, their curry sauce was amazing, and so were the chocolate covered strawberries, which is why i'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. i will not be back to throw away close to $100. i can go to ruth's chris and have an amazing meal for that price. i'm very disappointed."""
"1,""We were here 3 - yes I typed three - hours for a meal with two little kids.  Very long waits between the courses with no attention from server.  Of the three hours at least 60 full minutes was spent without any food in front of us.  But the best part, incorrect charges on the bill.  Wines prices upcharged on actual receipt to 1.5X the price listed on the menu.  I asked the manager on duty why there was a discrepancy and he went behind the bar, got some cash and gave it to me.  Now mind you, it was of course, no where near the amount I was overcharged but I guess it relieved his conscience.  He handed me the money and said \""""It will take me too long to find out who your server was and look up the transaction, so here you go.\""""  Unreal!  Food was average to below average and prices for what you get were a real rip off.  Original style broth that was recommended was so chock full of pepper you were downing water all night - if you could get a refill.  Save your money and time - go buy a fondue pot and do it at home.  You do all your own cooking here anyway so why not.  Will not return.  Hope this saves others a bad experience as well."""
"2,""Great anniversary dinner. Justifiably recommended by our friends.  Lovely and decadent. We loved it"""
"2,""I've been here a few times. A couple of times with the husband to enjoy a Groupon and a special menu option. And twice for ladies night with the co-workers since they do a special ladies night menu the first Tuesday of every month - which has a good price for all you get!\n\nWe almost always call ahead and make reservations - on ladies night, a reservation is a MUST since it fills up quickly.  The staff is always really friendly and they are more than happy to walk you through the process if you are new here.  The drinks are strong and the food comes in stages so you can really make this an great date night.  \n\nI'd be torn to choose between the cheese appetizer and the chocolate dessert for my favorite part of the meal, but since I'm more of a sweet than salty fan, I'll go with the dessert.  They always have special check-in offers and from time to time they offer Groupons, as well.  If you sign up online for their mailing list, you'll get some decent offers there, too!\n\nOverall: A\nA great spot for a date night experience, ladies night out, or special dinner for a loved one! Be sure to seek out specials since it can get a touch pricey."""
"1,""Made reservations and still waited 15 minutes in the lobby awkwardly as no one was paying attention to us. This was my first time at the melting pot so I had no idea what to expect but after waiting and finally being seated we sat at the table for another 15 minutes before the waitress showed up and awkwardly/reluctantly introduced herself. Anyways, we got the new cheese fondue thing they had, and the coppa bean something rather. Not my favorite fondue or broth but the filet mignon was delicious regardless as was the ahi tuna.  All in all, I hope I will never have to go back, It just isn't my cup of tea apparently."""
"2,""This place was amazing! The staff was friendly and informative and the food was delicious. Our server Ashley (not sure if that's the right spelling) was sweet and friendly, she even asked if it was alright if she used us to train a newbie first, which was very considerate. The newbie, who I forgot her name, did a spectacular job even though we could tell she was nervous. My only complaint was that the prices were insanely high. I wouldn't recommend going unless you had a coupon or are prepared to pay at least $30 a person. I also felt a little under dressed, but that's not the restaurants fault. Everything else was good though, and I will return in the future!"""
"1,""Don't go here!  I went it for a bang trim and hair cut and came home with an uneven mess.  My hair is naturally straight with NO layers or anything else.  All I asked for was to have my bangs trimmed and the ends trimmed up to get rid of split ends.  When I came home I was embarrassed at how my hair looked.  It was unbelievable how uneven the bangs were and the ends of the rest of my hair was.  I would not recommend going here.  Also, the stylist I had wasn't very friendly and even criticized me for straightening my hair everyday."""
"1,""The club is clean and well maintained.  The staff is polite, helpful and knowledgable.  There are a variety of classes offered throughout the day.  These are the hallmarks of a great club and Gainey Village has them.\n\nThe problem for me is the unventilated fryer/grill snack stand in the middle of the club.  The smell of fryers and griddles is absolutely thick in the air throughout the entire club like a stale Denny's.  This club used to limit its offerings to healthy wraps, smoothies and salads.  No problem - you could take it or leave it.  Bad enough a \""""health\"""" club serves fried foods, it does so without ventilating the fryer smoke through a proper commercial hood.\n\nThe heavy, oppressive greasy smell of the place is absolutely off putting and not the setting for a workout that one might want, unless the Village's target audience is now kids who crave greasy fast food.  Unless you get the urge to workout each time you smell fatty smoke, I suggest you consider whether you are willing to adjust your workout schedule to times when the improperly ventilated fried food stand in the middle of the club is closed."""
"2,""Love coming here. Usually get the spicy white meat chicken combo. The spring roll makes the meal for me. Friendly staff and owner (Marlene)."""
"1,""Samurai Sam's tries hard at creating some Asian inspired food\n\nThe three of us came here last week, each ordering something different. I had three chicken tacos which were good, but had virtually no meat. As you can see from the photos, it's hard to find any. Lots of veggies though.\n\nAs for my friends, they each ordered different types of teriyaki bowls. Both came with a lot of rice, but again not much else.\n\nSadly, you can get  nearly twice as much food at Panda Express.  It's hard to justify coming back, our bill came to $24.70, including two soft drinks and one water. So, Two Stars and yes, we have had better.\n\nSorry!"""
"1,""Went in to change from IPhone to Galaxy, the lady working there acted like is was a real imposition to have to wait on me.  Told me they charged $20 the transfer my info from old Verizon phone to new Verizon phone, ok that I understand.   She said we would have to change our plan even though we had not purchased the phone from Verizon, ask her to check and make sure that was correct.  She then started texting on her phone and left me standing.  After a while her associate came over and helped me. I did not have to change plans and even though it took over 4 hours to transfer the info I finally got it done.  If you would rather chat and text with your friends I suggest you do not get a job that requires customer service."""
"2,""Honestly, I might go broke if I lived within the general vicinity of this mecca of grocery stores.... This is the creme de le creme of Fry's, hands down the best single grocery store in all of Metro Phoenix.\n\n~What To Do~\nWay too much. First you can shop for pretty much any specific grocery need you can think of. They have a Coldstone inside....yes, Coldstone. They have a coffee shop, a car rental counter, a valet.... they also have a cigar/wine bar which specializes in wine flights...and a top flight sushi station. *gasps for breath*\n\n~The Good~\nOh, there is so much good. This place is stocked to the gills with extras that we can only dream of at other locations. Their specialty bread area, with artisan breads is surprising. The wine bar looks nice, although I haven't personally tried it myself. Its hard to explain this spot, other than it is a Fry's on steroids. The food is a bit nicer, and each aisle or section has different higher end items that you just don't see elsewhere. This is Fry's answer to Whole Foods and Sprouts, yet at a Costco size level. You simply must go... like Nike, Just Do It.\n\n~The Bad~\nWELL..... If you need a scooter, your battery might run out trying to see everything (I'm sorry about that God, that was my bad). If you loathe walking, in other words, then do not go here... All joking aside, the only negative I see is the location. It serious just plays directly to its clientele, upper class Scottsdalians (or w/e you call them, haha). People like myself in Central Phoenix and he surrounding cities are left in the dust, and its completely out of the question thinking about driving to shop here. Ha ha, no way. That's my biggest issue, just simply the fact that they placed this so far away from the other cities... meh..\n\n~The Down Low~\nDespite the location issue, this place is too great to lose even a half a star. There is too much good stuff.  5 stars for the typical good service, large selection, additional never-before-seen amenities, and the comparability of service to that of higher-end grocery chains. This place steps its game way up. Scottsdale, you are lucky!!!!!!!!"""
"1,""This is supposed to provide veterinary services and they do have professionals on the premises. A few years ago this store did help us with a dog having problems. Today they weren't doing so well. We needed a prescription from our Oregon vet filled. My wife called three times to confirm it could  be done and get a fax number. Our vet faxed it. We then visited a crowded, hectic waiting room and after 15 minutes found they don't fill prescriptions. I understand licensing though I don't understand why they don't have a license to sell dog medicine. My problem is that they didn't tell us they couldn't until we had considerable time invested. It didn't help that there was no acceptance of responsibility."""
"2,""Every time that I have been to this location.  I always leave happy.  Not only do I love their $ menu, but each time, the service is great.  They are always asking me how my day has been and more importantly, they are smiling.  I love that."""
"1,""I went for my first time to this nail salon and I will never go back.  The woman who did my nails talked the entire time to other manicurists in Vietnamese or whatever which in itself is rude and makes one feel paranoid that they are being talked about.  That would have been tolerable if the manicure itself had been worth it but it was a terrible manicure that lasted two days at most and some nails are are chipping and jagged already. I am a once a week client of manicures so my nails have been very well taken care of- until this week."""
"1,""Although Mimi was very nice, my manicure was horrible in every way a manicure can go badly. \n1. Polish so thick I have air bubbles on every nail. \n2. Completely uneven polish by the cuticles. Honestly, I do a much better job myself. \n3. It's been almost 2 hours now and it's STILL not dry and looks like an elephant stepped on my nails. \n4. The place was not very well ventilated and it's clear they rarely clean the place because there was a layer of dust everywhere. \nI would never go there again."""
"1,""WAS expecting the deliciousness of In-N-Out times two plus the options of Five Guys.... NOPE. Pretty much glorified cafeteria food. Hard store-bought bun, white iceburg lettuce, and limp pickles.\n\nNo unusual hamburger combos (like blue cheese, arugula, etc). No juicy beef patty. No fresh, ripe ingredients. No like!\n\nPlus the sodium on their fries is enough to cause a person to contract acute pitting edema :)\n\nWhy all the hype??"""

There is hardly any issues with scheduling an appointment and they don't make you wait forever in the waiting room or the exam room.\n\nI saw Dr. Cannon for the firstime on my last visit there and was pleased with his evaluation and treatment of my daughters issues."""

"1,""Sad to say, Ajo Al's continues to slide downhill.  At two recent trips we were served food that was obviously not freshly prepared - for example, eggs with chorizo which suspiciously had no trace of oil.  How is this possible since chorizo is so fatty?  Answer - the chorizo had been pre-cooked and then dumped into an egg mixture.  The result was burnt on the bottom but the cheese melted on top and the extremely hot plate told me it had been heated again, probably in an \""""alligator\"""".  The result was dry, almost tasteless, and completely unsatisfying.  \n\nYou want more - the chips were stale"

"1,""Biggest complaint I had with this place is the cleanliness.  Floor was pretty dirty and the legs of the chairs were gross.  The sandwich was ok, wouldn't run out and get another one because it was fantastic.   I asked for a side of yellow mustard and he gave me Heinz mustard packets which is usually no big deal, but the mustard inside these packets was gross.  I think it might have been way over its expiration date.  I had to scrape it off."""
"1,""Not a fan of my sandwich being tossed into the microwave twice. I think they heated up the turkey in the microwave and then they decided to melt the cheese in the micro as well. This was the turkey rueben and it was a pretty lame move on these guys part, especially when I see a flattop grill right below the microwave. Bread would have been crispier and the sandwich as a whole would have been great, but even these two local women decide to take shortcuts and the results are a soggy sandwich made by lazy cooks/owners. They still use quality turkey, but the rest is a joke."""

"2,""Awesome bagels, nice people."""
"2,""Not only are their bagels delicious, but they have THE BEST COFFEE in the valley, hands down.  Add a touch of cream and a little sweetener to their hazelnut vanilla brew or their breakfast blend for a slightly less sweeter version and it's practically HEAVEN in cup.  I'm not kidding.  I am a serious coffee drinker (couldn't tell ,could you?) and I am very picky.  So picky that before I discovered Lox, I would only drink the coffee that I made for myself at home because no one else's was good enough.  However, now that I have had the glorious coffee from Lox Stock & Bagel even my own coffee doesn't measure up.  I literally stop by and pick up a cup from there almost every day. YUMMMM!"""
"1,""I am surprised by all of these great reviews.  People comparing this place to bagels from New York.  No comparison whatsoever!

"1,""As relocated New Yorkers, we have searched for a good deli to satisfy our noshing needs. Sadly, this is not that place. The bagels tasted like Wonder Bread. You can get better Nova at Costco.

"2,""Our go-to neighborhood bar. This Zipp's far outweighs the Camelback location, in  my opinion. Maybe it's the more \""""in-tune\"""" servers or just the overall better quality of food - but we always choose this one to quench our wing and beer cravings! Their medium buffalo wings are the best in the valley that I've personally had and their happy hour drink specials cannot be beat.

If you want a good premium pint, a dozen medium wings and good service overall - Zipps' on Via De Ventura is the spot you should choose!"""
"1,""I enjoy most Zipps locations but this one has the worst management of all of all Zipps. Truly rude and definitely incompetent.

"1,""I attend Zipps often, however this Zipps on Via De Ventura, was not impressive. I invited a fairly large group of friends to come out Sunday to watch the playoffs. Sitting outside was not an issue since they had TV screens and a lot of tables that were empty. The problem was there were no heaters outside, no wonder it was empty. Now I know this is Arizona, but it gets pretty chilly outside in the winter especially when the area is shaded. Fifteen of my friends left and went elsewhere because it was too cold outside. Dollars out the door if you ask me. I ended up getting a booth inside with a few of us that decided to stay because you can't beat the happy hour prices for food and drinks anywhere else, but I froze my ass off the entire time. \n\nMy service was good with my first waitress, however when the next one showed up I had to flag her down for drinks as well as for my bill. Now if the place was packed I could totally understand the slow service, however it was a lot less empty then when I first arrived."""
"1,""I've lived at San Antigua for about 3 years.  My apartment is not updated, which is fine with me, because it saves me money (and I work only a mile away, so the commute is fantastic).  They did put in all new appliances about a year and a half ago, but I think they are the lowest quality possible. The original microwave had a tag inside that it was manufactured in August 1993 and it was not pretty.  But it was clean and it worked better than my new one.  Same with the other appliances. I would have been happy if they had replaced the washer with a efficient front loader!  But the one I have doesn't even have a delicate cycle.  I wash all of my work clothes in lingerie bags (I have about 10 now) to protect them from the beating they would get in that washer.\n\nI have had a few maintenance requests, and they have usually come right away.  I noticed comments about the water being off, and the water was off often.  Once until late at night (when the notice said during the day only) and there was no way to get an update.  It was very inconvenient and annoying, but that is resolved.\n\nMy main issue is with the office staff, which is what is driving me to write today.  The two main ladies I've interacted with in the last year (I think one is gone now, but her replacement is no better) are not helpful at all.  Last year I was going to be away for 4 weeks and I asked about how I could handle my rent and my water bill payment (I was to return on the 4th of the month).  I could pay my rent ahead of time (not ideal, but that's fine). But for the water bill, I should pay more than the amount I paid for that month to make sure I covered next months, because they charge you a late fee if you are one day late.  I think they should have worked with me for the $20 water bill that would have been 5 days late.  Their attitude was \""""too bad\"""" and they weren't even nice about it.\n\nThere used to be a drop box that I would drop my rent into on my way to work on the first, but that is now gone. You can pay your rent online now, but the water bill doesn't show up on your account until sometime on the 1st usually after 10 am (I can usually pay at lunch time and its there).  Today however, I went to pay a little after noon, and the water bill did not yet show up on my account.  I called the office and was told they were having trouble with getting the water bill online. I could bring a check in to the office.  I pointed out they don't have a drop box anymore.  She pretty much said I would be charged a late fee if I didn't pay today.  So I hope I remember to go back online to pay that portion and I have to hope it is there to pay. Its like I get a 6 - 8 (if I'm lucky) hour window to pay the rent and I better make it work with my life.  It is very frustrating and annoying.  I've never had issues like this any where else I have lived.\n\nLast year I probably would have rated them 4 stars, but with my issues with the office staff, I am down to 2.  And I'm considering moving out when my lease is up in the fall."""
"2,""I loved living here!  \n\nI have lived at San Antigua for almost a year.  I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here.  Yes, the units are dated, but wonderful floorplans, very clean, spacious decks, extra storage, actual laundry rooms (older equipment, but works great).  I am a single woman and feel completely safe despite often arriving home late.  I LOVE that they allow pets by breed (not size).  \n\nThe award-winning grounds are outstanding with something beautiful blooming year-round and well maintained palm, pine and native trees.  There is a wonderful greenbelt where my dog loves to run each morning and meet his many pals - a virtual playground for the dogs.  The adjacent golfcourse and walking/biking path is easy to access and another beautiful place to walk.  the many varieties of migrating birds are spell-binding from geese and ducks to beautiful huge blue heron and two or three kinds of all white birds - snow geese? egrets? not sure, but I counted over 40 of them one day in the golf course lakes.  \n\nWhile the pool furniture may be older - it is in very acceptable condition -- the area is super clean, the pools and fountains are beautiful and well-maintained. The gym and common areas as well.  \n\nThe maintenance staff is super responsive and friendly, as are the groundskeepers.  The office staff is helpful, and responsive, but seem to have their hands tied by a less caring management.  You definitely get the feel that the complex is not a labor of love, but about business and the bottom line.  And, in fairness, it is a business, not a condominium complex. Doing more would increase the rents which I thought for all you get were very reasonable.  If they were condos,  I would buy in here in a minute.  Also, people who live here are friendly, respectful, all ages,  and it is very quiet - unlike several other complexes I considered. The unique 3-bedroom units are great for families.  Also,the central location and easy access to 101 is ideal. I am very sorry to be heading back North and leaving San Antigua, but will remember my time here very positively.  Would highly reccomend to anyone."""

The air conditioner in the rooms wasn't working \nAnd they brought us a floor heater which wasn't enough to keep the room warm in the cold winter.The  4 paws program costs $150 per 6 day stay and all they gave us was an old dirty pet bed and a pet dish which we didn't think was clean to use .The towels in the room were old and felt like they've been used for many many years. Overall the ground and the pools were the nicest part of the hotel and the rooms were the worst part of the hotel did not feel like a five star hotel. Oh and the beds are super uncomfortable and so as the pillows. We were here for our first year wedding anniversary and it was noted in the reservation but not once was acknowledged. The food is pricey and not really worth it . Two orders of salmon and a guacamole and chips starter cost us almost $70 . The next day we went out and shopped for dinner."""

"1,""I've stayed here several times over several years. The decor is nice, the setting is serene, and the beds are comfortable. But, I can't imagine staying here except through name your own price bids on Priceline. I would bid a lower star level on Priceline, except for fear of getting some unlikely but dreadful outcome. Bidding for Scottsdale Conference Center, more Conference Center than Resort, is risk management. Sadly, I've never gotten a (different) resort in Scottsdale to take my bid. Many complain about the resort fee and the location of the self-parking. I don't love these either, but I think they're immaterial. (More thoughts on the resort fee at the end.)\n\nI have not raised any of the following concerns before this review, because it seems futile. I have never used the pool. Why would I? It and the surroundings are forgettable compared to many relatively pedestrian hotels in the metro area and elsewhere. Also, the chemicals in the hot tub were so strong that they bleached my trunks. The chairs in the room are uncomfortable (and I don't think they are antiques, which might be worth having even if not comfortable). There are some really simple fails that I can't believe the hotel doesn't fix, and the lack of effective response seems to speak to the hotel's lack of concern for guest satisfaction...1. If you can actually get it brewed, the in-room coffee is vile--yes, vile. Remember to bring your own coffee with you, if you like having decent coffee before going out in the morning. 2. The coffee pots are dysfunctional--they get stuck regularly and don't complete brewing"

"1,""If I could give it a zero, I would.  Time was, I would have given it a four star rating mainly because of the courtyard right outside of the suites.  However....  They have recently changed the management team and much of the staff.  The new staff and management are unbelievably rude and nasty,  We used to stay there while in AZ (I mean for 2 to 6 months at a time, yes, that long).  Mainly because they do take dogs and our dogs liked the courtyard area.  This last time, I had numerous run ins with the staff i.e., one morning the guy next to me left his alarm on when he left.   At FIVE A.M.  The front desk refused to go shut it off saying they didn't want to disturb him if he was still there.  I'm like \""""if he's still there, he's dead, because the alarm is REALLY loud\"""".  They would not call him, knock on his door or anything.  Finally at 7 am I asked housekeeping and they said they'd take care of it.  Nope.  Finally at 8 a.m. I found someone to shut the alarm off.  Another time my dog and I got sick after being in the grass there.  I asked if they spray pesticides or herbicides there.  They assured me they don't.  A week later I see a maintenance guy walking around with a can of herbicides, getting ready to spray.  So I call the manager to complain about being lied to and to ask what the story is.  She would not return my calls.  Not only that, but if you complain about anything, the employees will all gather around you and give you dirty looks to try to intimidate you.  Another time I could not find ANYONe to take my dirty towels and give me clean ones.  So I went into the laundry area and called out.  Nobody.  So I dropped some of my towels off.  THEN a man rushed in and demanded to know what I'm doing in there.  uh, stealing dirty towels?  Yeah, right.  He was really nasty and lectured me.  This place USED to be very customer oriented.  Not anymore.  Considering it isn't \""""all that\"""" anyway, I'd pass it by and go elsewhere.  Even next door to many of the other customer oriented places.  Also, the clientele is getting more and more questionable.  I had crack addicts stay next to me for a week last time.

They have a very large wine list, and a full bar. You can also place reservation for large parties. I would even recommend that you place a reservations if it's Thursday Friday or Saturday because the wait can be very long if you just show up. They do serve a Chicago style pie pizza, which is to die for! They do slices of pizza if you're trying to eat light or cheap during the lunch hour. And everything is literally made fresh, with very high quality.  The only thing that ever makes me sad here is that the ladies restroom only has one stall.....

I have always been a BIG fan of Mimi's but this latest visit for a late breakfast on a Sunday morning was the most disappointing visit ever.  After almost a 20 minute wait we were finally seated even though the restaurant did not appear to be full.  The young girls who were taking names and seating customers didn't seem to know what they were doing.  Despite giving us one of those ridiculous vibrating devices with flashing red lights, they came outside at least twice looking for someone they could not find.  \n\nThe biggest disappointment was the cost of our breakfast dishes for what we received.  We each ordered a mimosa with a low end sparkling wine which cost almost $8 each.  My wife ordered their bacon apple waffles which were very good and tasty but there were only 3 tiny waffles about the diameter of a tennis ball . . . completely bare and accompanied by the tiny cup of syrup with chopped apples and bacon bits.  I have a French variation of eggs Benedict which was also pretty tasty but pricey for two small poached eggs on some seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach.\n\nOur server was efficient but somewhat intense and not very personable.  Even the carpet in the dining area appeared dirty and unkempt.  Just not a great experience.  Probably won't return to ANY Mimi's for some time because they have definitely lost their edge and reputation as an upscale value chain restaurant.\n\nAlthough I am a budding senior citizen (my wife is NOT) I'm beginning to feel out of place at Mimi's which is often populated by a sea of white hairs and snow birds who don't seem to mind their mediocre, high priced fare set in a sort of Disneyesque French atmosphere.  It just doesn't resonate with me anymore and it doesn't feel at all upscale middle of the road like it used when they first opened restaurants in So Cal where I used to live."""

It is on one of the two TPC Scottsdale golf courses (not the one that has the Waste Management Tournament). It has a nice pool area, a great patio for dinning.

Did a couple rounds, but became irritated and a little frightened at the absolute madness. \n\nNo staff was on the ice to keep at least some order to things. I figured during your busiest hour there's literally not one staff member to keep unsupervised children going in the right direction? Many loose items were on the rink,such as girls holding their purses while attempting to skate. Entire large families were holding hands on the rink, completely blocking the way...only to stop and take photos right in the middle of the ice. Groups of people were standing around oblivious to their surroundings, chatting and blocking the path.\n\nSkating here as a more advanced but considerate, SAFETY FIRST skater was impossible. Kids were falling all around me, and luckily I know how to navigate and stop before running them over (note that there was probably only 5 other skaters on the ice who knew how to skate so this is scary). Rentals were extremely dilapidated, and when I brought back a defective skate I was told in a condescending manner that I wasn't \""""lacing them right.\"""" Kind of scary for the next person to come along.\n\nI find their holiday/public skate to be *extremely dangerous*.

"1,""This dry cleaner recently took over from the previous owners that I decided to stop going to because they didn't accommodate alterations on site.

She asked me to drop off her dress so I decided to add a White House/Black Market cotton/viscose sweater to be cleaned. White House is my go-to store for all my work clothes.\n\nWhen I went to pick up the dress and sweater, my sweater was BEIGE!!! The young girl behind the counter saw my face and said \""""Is their something wrong?\"""" I said \""""Yes, my white sweater looks like its been ruined. It was white.\"""" She said \""""I'm sorry, we've had trouble with the guy in the back.  I will put it back through to be cleaned again.\""""  I relented.\n\nA week later I went to pick it up. Now, let me tell you. A cotton and viscose sweater has a shiny thread appearance to it. It is has a lusterous rather than matte fabric.  My sweater looked beat-up, dingy, grayed, frayed and lacked the original luster it held. Obviously, the cleaners damaged it the first time and in order to get the discoloration or polluted smog out of it they had to bleach it. The sweater recommends you use non-chlorine bleach. It has the option to hand wash or dry clean. The owner Martin happened to be the one I was greeted by upon pick up. I very calmly spoke to him and told him I was not happy. I said, \""""My sweater is ruined. It's lost its white color and is quite frayed. It's not shiny anymore.\"""" He said, \""""I am sorry and paused.\"""" I said, \""""I would like it replaced.\"""" He said, \""""You will have to find your receipt. Bring a copy of your receipt and I will reimburse you.\"""" I agreed and he asked to retain the sweater.\n\nThis sweater wasn't horribly expensive. It was $88 but i got it on sale for $66.88. I keep all my receipts and found it. I returned one week later and left off a copy of the receipt with a new clerk.  I was told I would get a call when my check was ready to be picked up.\n\nI didn't get a call back. This was a busy time for me so i finally got over there on Christmas Eve to pick up my reimbursement check. Martin was there. He said \""""I am not going to reimburse you. I took your sweater to the White House/Black Market store and spoke to two sales people and the manager. I compared your sweater to another similar sweater and everyone agreed it was just like new.\"""" I was flabbergasted.  I said, \""""You're kidding right? You went to the store?  I'm embarrassed for you. You can't tell it has been ruined? Your clerk said that you had trouble with another work who turned it beige.\""""  He said something like ... the sweater was cleaned properly and I have been reassured by the store it is in its original condition.  I don't remember what he said after that.  I can't believe a store would not stand by its customer's disapproval of their services and not make amends.  \n\nYou guys!  My sweater is un-wearable!

In fact, we trusted her so much that we ultimately gave her complete creative freedom for the event. \n\nThe difference between a regular florist and a DESIGNER, is that Lorraine was able to bring our wedding space to life by creating elegant, balanced designs combined with unique colors and textures. \n\nI was overwhelmed with guests praising how magnificent the flower arrangements were. My cascading bouquet of QueenAnne's lace, ranunculus and orchids smelled incredible. But my personal favorite was her chuppah design of smilax which accentuated the incredible garden view of the mountains.\n\nEvery detail was considered. Every petal was inspected.  It was simply... breathtaking. Thank you again to Lorraine and the entire crew at Brady's and the Sanctuary who made our wedding simply unforgettable."""

The chips and dip was the only bonus out of the entire meal.  I definitely got what I paid for. Never again."""

"1,""Wow...and I don't mean that in a good way! It's hard for me to write a review about a business like this as my experiences are typically not this bad, but here we go: My first review that is really bad. I visited this Chili's today because I had a couple of gift cards received from the holidays and lunch was still marinating at home. I previously heard that they had a menu of 550 calorie meals. I'm not really a calorie counter, but I'm definitely health conscious and I looked at what the offerings were from the website and was impressed by their 550 calorie meals. They seemed really appetizing and filling and for the most part used unprocessed, unrefined ingredients. \n\nWell, I arrived for lunch as aforementioned and there was no greeter. Okay...that's fine. I just waited a little. It gave me time to view the interior to get a feel for it before I go any further. I didn't like the environment. It was really dark"
"1,""I should have checked on here before visiting this place. If I could give them no stars I would too.\n\nI am sorry to say that this was by far the worst experience I have had dealing with anyone. I have dealt with some horrible used car salesmen before and this appliance place puts them all to shame. They have no common sense what so ever. They delivered a defective refrigerator and had the audacity to want to charge us 25% restocking fee when we requested to exchange it. I am appalled at their business practices and can not fathom how could someone let $35k worth of a sales fall through because they do not want to work with the customer and resolve some issues that in my opinion could have easily been rectified. Thanks to them we ended up going to Spencers and saved an additional $1200 because they were running a special when you buy a refrigerator, stove-top, and oven."""

The whole restaurant has a modern, comfortable, welcoming feel, but the long bar really caught our attention. It's the perfect place to come after work to enjoy a drink, some socializing, not spend a lot or wait long for your food.  We originally ordered only iced teas until we saw how reasonably priced the margaritas were, which were delicious and refreshing.\n\nThe staff was friendly, patient, helpful and exuded the feeling that they liked working there. I even chatted a bit with Memo the cook, whose open kitchen was clean and orderly.\n\nAs for the food, it's very satisfying and will cause next-day cravings!

I have to confess, I very seldom eat here - not because the food is bad - but simply because I am usually on my way one place or another.  What I have eaten - burgers, pizza, appetizers - all have been good, but not outstanding.  However, the portions are large and filling.\n\nWhat stands out are their beers.  Beside my two favorites, the IPA's are solid, and their specialty beers are outstanding.  \n\nAlthough it can get rushed at times, I have always had great service.  My only criticism is that sometimes they do not schedule correctly, and the poor servers are running to keep up.  They do a wonderful job, but you can tell that they have to many tables to serve. \n\nBe aware - it can get busy, particularly at night and during popular games.

"1,""I have been to this place a couple of times for business lunches and had never been disappointed with food or service until tonight.\n\nFood 2/5\n\nWe had the thai hummus and southwest burger. The hummus is actually very nice. Has a nice kick to it and you take taste the peanut sauce but its not overwhelming. The pita however was very soggy and felt like it came straight out of a microwave. The southwest burger was good, nothing more and nothing less. I did expect more 'southwest flavor' though.\n\nService 1/5\n\nAbout 2 minutes after our appetizer was brought out the server brought our entree's  'Sorry, your server put in two different tickets' was his reaction when he noticed that we had just begun eating the appetizer. When we asked our waitress she said 'its so quiet tonight that they're just really fast bringing out the food.'  \n\nWhen I notified the waitress that the fries were luke warm and that I was not happy with the whole situation she looked at us with a 'wow, I really dont care. wtf are you complaining about' attitude and asked us what we would like her to do. \nI guess it was too much to ask of her to just fix the situation. We ended up eating our appetizer as dessert -after- our entree since the entree itself wasnt warm to begin with and didnt want it to cool any further while we ate our appetizers. Then, when we *after* were finished another server brought new fries -which we did not ask for and sent back to the kitchen- ???\n\nTo top it off, our server must have noticed that we already had dessert in the form of appetizers and dropped the check at our table without asking whether we wanted dessert. And yes, you've guessed it, everything was on there we paid full price for very poor service and mediocre food.\n\nThe beer was good though but thankfully you can get that at a dozen other places throughout the valley."""

The salt, everything, poppy and onion are delicious and they have a Hawaiian, which I didn't think would be good but I ended up loving it (it has coconut and I think pineapple).  The cream cheese is very good and they put the right amount on, at least for my taste.  I like the fact that these aren't the pale bagels you mostly see out here, these are crispy outside with a nice toasty brown color.\n\nHusband loves the weekend omelet sandwich.

Not only did they majorly mess up my order, I got my order to go, so I did not realize my order was wrong until after I drove all the way home and opened my bag. To start, this place asks for your name when you order, So they messed up my name and were calling out someone else's name for about 10 minutes before they realized it was my order. So there was a long wait, no where to sit, and because they did not make my order correctly, I basically had to throw it out. I was charged extra for things I did not receive, so I am mad about that.

Five dollar a gallon gas may actually be a good thing."""

Years later I am now having problems, & am having to pay thousands more (even with insurance!) to get medicine put in it, drilled, & then re-done. If they would have been highly skilled in the first place - this wouldn't have even been necessary. I had also told the male doctor on staff about this problem - as I wasn't sure what it was looking like below the surface, but it was bothering me. & he didn't even bother to check it out.

When I pulled up to the end of the drive thru, I opened my bag, unwrapped my sandwich and thought the bread was a bit cold. I took a bite into my sandwich only to find that bun was slightly frozen, the marinara sauce cold, the cheese frozen and the chicken lukewarm at best!  I put the car in reverse, went to the window and waited. The same woman opened the window, didn't say anything to me so I told her about the sandwich. I explained that the sandwich was cold and the cheese was frozen. Her reply?  Well after what seemed like an eternity of silence, her reply was \""""no it's not. The cheese is cold though\"""". I said \""""noooo...the sandwich is cold and the bun is a bit frozen still\"""". After snatching the sandwich out of my hand, she closed the window. A couple minutes later a guy handed me a bag with a new sandwich. Again, no words. Just window opened and then closed. I was afraid to open the bag but I was brave.

A trip to AZ that was related to a recently deceased parent was made better with the fact that my husband booked a suite at the Inn at Eagle Mountain for the 1 night we needed to be in town. 6 weeks prior to our trip he made the reservations and we received confirmation. We looked forward to taking solace in the gorgeous surroundings. We arrived in Phoenix and as we were being shuttled to the car rental facility, my husband turned his phone on. A voice mail had been left from the Inn telling us they did not have a room for us. We immediately called to find out what the problem was and were told they \""""we're very sorry, but...\"""" they had no rooms available.

They offered to find us a \""""comparable place to stay\"""".  We arrived at the Inn about 30 mins later. Our first question was why were we not notified until we had arrived in town. Their reply was that they were waiting to see if there might be a last minute cancellation. As an explanation we were told that new owners had recently taken over and were not well versed in the customer service aspect of hotel management. The receptionists agreed that this was unacceptable.  They did get us booked into another local hotel. Far from the beautiful ambiance of the Eagle Mt properties and the comfort of a king-size suite, we were directed to the nearby Marriott Courtyard, in a room with double beds.

The calamari was very good - tender, not greasy, and just a light dusting of breading. The meal took forever to arrive, despite being just a salad (DRENCHED in dressing) and an entree. The main entree was cold, as was the plate. Clearly the plate had been sitting in queue for some time (I had a hunch since the folks who came in after us, a party of four, were served first, and attentively at that). My mother voiced the complaint to the owner that the entree was cold but he barely seemed to acknowledge - he seems to be flighty and not that accomodating.

"1,""OK...I just walked back into my hotel room after a meal at this place. I think I'm being overly generous by even giving them one star.  Fact of the matter is I had no choice but to give them one because there was nothing lower.\n\nI had the #5 combination which consisted of one cheese enchilada (which was 1/100th of a percent decent), one shredded beef hard shell taco (which was perhaps the best thing on the plate), and one bean tostada (stale tostada).  I also ordered an overpriced ($7.95) chile relleno a la carte that tasted more like an \""""effen\"""" omelette.  C'mon now!!! The consistency of the egg covering the chile relleno should be fluffy and quickly fried.  This thing looked like and tasted as if they first made an Omelette and then wrapped it around a steamed chile....the chile wasn't even fire roasted!!!! \n\nFriends, I know real Mexican food....FINE Mexican food for that matter and this place IS NOT IT!  With all due respect to those of you who have written rave reviews about this place and of course to the proprietors, BUT I think I would have had a much better meal at the nearest taco bell, gladly paying the $25 bucks I laid down for a less than mediocre meal.  My recommendation to you all is .....DON'T BOTHER.  They should really consider dropping the \""""FINE\"""" from the name of this establishment.\n\nOn a good note - The lady tending bar that evening was very very nice and attentive.... unfortunately the service alone can't hold this place up."""
"2,""Finally as a long time Angel fan I hit up a spring training session in AZ. It did not disappoint at all. My wife and went out and got to catch a game and scored some autographs. We stayed at the Comfort Inn that was about a mile away and walked to Tempe Diablo so we didn't have to deal with the parking.  It was a Saturday game so it was sold out and pretty crowded. We lined up and scored a few autographs so I was pretty stoked. \n\nOur seats were in the Honey Brown Sweet Spot, which is the shaded area that is an all you can it section. (beast mode engaged) Seriously if you can get one of the tickets it will save you on a hot day and make sure your ready to eat. They serve up dogs, burgers and sausages. They also have peanuts, kettle chips and other little munchies that will keep you coming back for more. I was really hoping for a nacho bar. : ( \n\nI really enjoyed this little spot, its got a nice feel to it, its small and has a intimate feel.

This kind of planning and prep makes it very difficult to eat out.  However, the folks in the deli here were very helpful and accommodating to our requests in this regard.\n\nThen, when we were in the checkout line, our clerk offers us bags of ice to keep our food cold on the way home.  This is far and away better service than the Whole Foods in San Mateo back in the Bay Area.  I even remarked to my wife that I wish they could just pick the whole building up and relocate this Whole Foods to the San Francisco area.  We'd come often for the great service.

I got my friend an egg and cheese on a bagel and everything seemed to be made fresh. \n\nI would not rate them 4 stars for the blueberry bagel I tried the next visit (though the strawberry cream cheese was very good). The coffee was, once again, very good. They also do free refills on the coffee, which is pretty fantastic.

People walk on the wrong side of the mall, or walk in large groups that prevent people from getting by.\n\nAnd the worst part: there are at least ten different cell phone kiosks and you get badgered every time you walk by.

The peanut sauce was super oily. \n\nNext was the Laab - I had high hopes for this because it usually is always good everywhere I go but this dish was much too salty.\n\nThe noodle dish was the worst dish. The noodles were really hard.  I could tell they did not warm up the noodles enough before cooking it. Also, there was no flavor to this dish at all. A big disappointment as phad kee Mao is always flavorful with the sauce and basil. \n\nLastly the stirfry tasted nothing like what it should have tasted like. It was a typical stir fry and it was quite dry. \n\nOverall we phad 33 for everything so the food was cheap. The service is better than most Asian restaurants so we tipped our waitress well.

"2,""YC's is pretty fantastic.  You go in, pay $8 or so, and you get approximately one metric assload of food (note: metric assloads are larger than American assloads).  However, a lot of this really depends on your skill in packing as much food as possible into a fairly reasonable-sized bowl.  If you're like me and enjoy few things as much as having the blood of cute animals dripping down your chin, you should probably pack the bowl to the top (yes, I'm serious) with meat.  Don't forget to grab a few sheets of parchment paper so you can crush everything down and maximize the amount of food you get in your bowl.  Anyway, your veggies, noodles, and whatever else you want can be piled on top of the bowl o' meat.  If you do this right, your leaning tower of delicious should be roughly 3 times or so the height of the bowl.  Next time I'm at YC's I'll have to take a picture so this can be better illustrated.  Oh, and don't forget the sauces - they really make or break the meal.  If you're unsure on what kind of sauce to get, there are chalkboards all over with recipes, or the friendly YC's staff will help you figure out what you might like.  I'd *highly* recommend if you follow a sauce recipe to make double because you're going to need a lot of sauce if you filled your bowl up like I told you to.\n\nYC's is probably the best bang for your buck lunch or dinner you can get in Tempe.  Chances are good you'll end up with enough leftovers for at least another meal or two.  Just don't forget, doggie bags are 50 cents a piece, so bring some quarters or singles."""
"1,""Was brought here by a couple of friends who kept raving about the food.  My first and last time.  I begged them to try another place to compare.  \n\nThe meat resembled rolled up frozen deli meat of poor quality.  Nothing fresh, very tasteless and dry.  The selection of veggies looked sad and very picked-over.  I was disappointed that there was not an option of adding an egg.  And the starch choice was noodles or plain rice, that's all.  Lots of choices of sauces but they still couldn't make it delicious.\n\nBut wait...  free frozen yogurt!  I could care less.  I eat at Mongolian grills for the Mongolian, not crappy generic soft serve.  And then to be charged for a to-go box?  That's ridiculous.\n\nI will go to Genghis Grill instead.

"2,""When I was the young age of 3, my mom brought me to YC's. I have been going ever since. This place is such a pleasant change from all the typical restaurants where you sit down, order from a set menu, and then get served your meal. Here you get to branch out and build your own Mongolian stir-fry from a huge selection of raw ingredients from the buffet style food line. There's meat, tons of vegetable selections, other toppings, and various types of noodles to add. But the personalization doesn't stop there. You then get to create your own sauce either on your own or using any of YC's own personal recipes. At this point, you hand over your bowl to one of their \""""grill warriors\"""" and watch them bring your stir-fry to life on the giant grills. The finished product always is perfectly cooked, has epic taste and flavor because it has EXACTLY what you want, and keeps you coming back! YC's also has crispy wontons, rice, and chopsticks (of course) to complete the meal! This is a place I will never get tired of because the possibilities are endless.

Especially since this branch has some hot male employees...anyway what am i reviewing here? \n\nPretty big store front, bigger than most of the Whole Foods I've patronized back home, and a good selection of food that doesn't seem over-the-top granola-y. The produce wall is GORGEOUS, i could just envision making the world's biggest and most beautiful salad. The icing on the cake (for me at least) is their bulk food bins, with everything from Live Yeast and Bulgher to Cinnamon Licorice and Crystallized Ginger.  I bought a big bag of Wasabi Peas and some ginger to tide me over on my afternoon excursion.\n\nHopefully an empty store at lunch time doesn't mean a struggling store because Sunflower Market is lovely!"""
"2,""Go shopping for a half hour here and at any of the other grocery stores around, check out.  You'll have saved money and will have more actual food, less packaging and less chemicals.\n\nAs far as local grocery stores go, this one is my favorite.  The meat and produce are better priced and of better quality than any of the chains around.  Chicken breasts are consistently $3.00 a pound here, can't beat that.\n\nThe staff here are knowledgable, kind and interested in their jobs.  I try to do all of my shopping here as I think it makes me healthier and definetly saves me money."""
"2,""I like this store a lot! They really go the extra mile to make it nice.          Very similar to Sprouts. I don't know if they are owned by the same people or not .  They give you 10cents off your bill for everyone of your forever bags that you bring in. That is the best deal i know of. Plus, they even have coffee out if you would like a sample. While shopping.     They have a deli which only provides Boar's Head. Which is a very good thing. No additves and GMO in it.   they will cut your meat and cheese any thickness you like and they put paper inbetween each slice. Which is a wonderful thing.   They even have Organic wine for a very good price.    Very many good things at this store , and well worth the visit."""

Now that my kitchen is done I don't eat there often but I do make sure to buy a pizza at least once a month with those guys."""
"1,""Thought it was pretty sad that they charge $10 to have your X-rays emailed over to a new dentist (I moved therefore needed a new dentist).

"1,""Went there for a NBA Playoff Game (Suns vs. Spurs) about a year ago.  It was crowded and there were many drunk dirty boys trying to score - ewwe!  It has the potential to be a nice little-hole-in-the-wall place, but as it stands currently-not so much.  Would not recommend this place."""
"2,""Great place to watch football, they have tons of tv's everywhere! They have a great deal for domestic pitchers $6.75! There food and service is really good too. However, it is hard to get good cell phone service in there, so that's a little disappointing."""
"2,""Absolute great place to learn or just squeeze in a quick 9-hole round. Clubhouse serves a great lunch/dinner, live music at nights later in the week, and ice-cold Hopshock always on tap. Service of the pro shop and the restaurant is pretty good.\n\nThe best part about Shalimar are the lessons from Tyler and Paul. I was a TERRIBLE golfer when I started earlier this year. My swing is starting to get there with their help and I couldn't be happier. Buckets are reasonable priced to work on your swing, and a 9-hole round with cart is pretty cheap (especially now).\n\nFootGolf is a great idea and fun to play. It can be challenging at times for actual golfers to play around the big groups, but if you check their schedule on when the FootGolfers are allowed, they are easily avoided. Heck, buy a 6-pack from the clubhouse and play a round of FootGolf for yourself and see why the popularity is growing.\n\nAll-in-all, I love going to Shalimar. I have made it my home course while I am learning to play the game and I would recommend it to others."""
"1,""we went to STFK for the first and unfortunately the last time tonight.

Tried the cornbread which is so dry it literally leaves a gritty residue in your mouth. The focaccia bread is on the oily side and the batch we got was way overloaded with rosemary. Also got the fettuccine pomodoro which is cooked fresh to order and wasn't bad but definitely nothing I'd order again. I like the new look but definitely not the new food."""
"2,""Best buffet hands down!!\n\nI love healthy eating, and I also love buffets. This is the best of both worlds for me.\n\nThe salads and topping always taste fresh and the soups are always very tasty. I love how they rotate specialty items every week it seems so you get to try new soups, salads, desserts and more. \n\nYou could eat super healthy here, but you can also fill up to the point that you need to be rolled out very quickly. Even the kids plate you can get for the little ones has more than enough room for plenty of food. \n\nAs far as this location specifically, it is my favorite. They recently remodeled not only their decor, but their overall operating structure in general. Definitely a vast improvement to what they were and compared to some of the other Sweet Tomatoes locations. Sine the change, I have not had a bad experience here."""

Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross\n\nAnd finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished. \n\nThe steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use. \nWhich is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.\n\nI wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.  \n\nHundreds of businesses in the area close down every year, and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.

My co-worker went there the next day, got a sandwich, found 3 hairs in it, and when she went back, the manager told her they'd make her a new one but they wouldn't refund her money.  \n\nYeah, it's not indicative of every single eating experience there, and the teriyaki bowl wasn't horrible, just horribly overpriced (which is why they get two stars instead of one), but unless they have some manner of overhaul, they can eat my balls."""

"1,""I called around to locate and get price quotes for specific tires with an \""""out the door\"""" price including mounting and balancing. Purcell quoted less expensive than the rest.

When I got there they tried to sell me the scam tire insurance (It only adds replacement coverage for the 2% of punctures which are not repairable, and only at their chain) and I declined. The price which I was quoted was not the price I paid. They had two individual itemized charges for both balancing and for tire disposal and added a materials fee. It was about $70.00 over the \""""out the door\"""" price, which became more expensive the last time I purchased identical tires elsewhere and competitor's phone quotes. \n\nThey opened my hood and poked around while I was not present without my permission, then tried to convince me to have them do additional work which they described as dire.

This week I got a coupon in the mail, since they also added me to their mailing list without asking. I won't be using it. \n\nI'll give them some credit, though- they didn't take a chunk out of my rim like discount tire did with their rushed work.

It was his first time to see the magic of the movie or a one in 3D at an IMAX.\n\nThe magic was washed away as soon as I stepped into the holding area to the theatre.  It was a dreary, depressing, uncomfortable place to wait until the theatre doors were ready.  I saw that there was popcorn, MY FAVORITE PART OF A MOVIE, but it I wasn't hit with the scent of seduction when I walked in.  To me, that means old, cold popcorn.

Luckily, there weren't many people so we sat where we wanted without a problem.  The seats were stained with God knows what, arm rests were broken, seats were broken.  It was disgusting.  I have been in multiple IMAX theaters in Florida and they have all been pristine!  Where, exactly, is my $15.00 going?\n\nThe sound is amazing, the screen is awesome and 3D is incredible.

I drank the kool aid and I am now a believer of why this place is proud of their wings.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the California Clucker. Chibata bread, grilled chicken, bacon, a mayo of types, and avacado. Served with wide-cut steak fries, it was delish. THe bacon was a little too crispy for me, but the avacado was just smushy enough.

"1,""Recently my husband and I were on our way to an appointment, and in need of dinner and having about an hour to kill, we decided to try Casa Reynoso since we see it every time we shop at the Fry's grocery store located in the same strip.  I was interested to see if this family-owned place had decent Mexican food.  Having been raised on New Mexico-style Mexican food, I am always on the hunt for food that tastes like Grandma's.  \n\nCasa Reynoso was just ok.  The decor is dated and slightly dingey, but I never judge a restaurant on their decor, it is the service and food that matter, so let's get to that:\n\n-The service was decent.  The waitress seemed to be in a hurry and no one was smiling.  The place wasn't very busy, but we had to wait a while to get our drinks and small little basket of chips and cup of bland, watery salsa.   \n\n-The food quality was just ok.  Nothing outstanding in my book.  I ordered the taco, enchilada, and relleno combination plate with rice and beans.  The rice and beans were probably the best thing I ate there.  The beans had great flavor and not too much salt, and the rice was cooked perfectly, also with lots of flavor.  It's difficult mess up a standard fried beef taco, and the one I had was the same as any other taco you'll get on a combination plate at any Mexican place.  The relleno was also ok, but not a lot of flavor and too much egg.  The enchilada was your regular old cheese rolled into a tortilla and smothered in cheese and enchilada sauce.  The sauce was absolutely disgusting and I ended up only eating a bite of the enchilada.  I will say that I appreciate that they didn't mask the blandness of the food by absolutely suffocating it in cheese.  The food was so mediocre that I don't even remember what my husband ordered, and he definitely didn't rave about it.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't jump to recommend this place to anyone.  The food is mediocre, the staff didn't seem to care, and honestly, we could have gone around the corner to Riva's and gotten better food at their drive-through.  \n\nOf course, I love to give second chances, and I would love to see more family-owned Mexican restaurants thrive in tempe.  A couple of other reviewers recommended the green chili and burritos.  I will have to try those next time, but I don't really have high expectations for this place and probably won't be going back any time soon."""

Imagine my surprise when I was told an hour and a half when I walked in the door. \n\nWhat happened to 30 minutes or less? \n\nNow I've wasted half of my lunch hour getting here, no oil change and now I'm hangry (translation: hungry + angry). \n\nNext stop: jiffy lube! :)"""

"1,""My flight was cancelled and I was given a room here for free.  The staff was busy and trying to be efficient and we were tired.  We were given a room as far from the front desk as you can get and after having walked there, the room had not been cleaned, unmade beds and such.  We went back to the office and I asked for a complaint form, they didn't have any and they didn't know how to record a complaint.  They gave us a room closer and it only smelled dirty and there was only a small wad of hair in the shower.\nYuck!!@!!"""
"1,""This is a large facility with major conference facilities attached. The rooms are *VERY* dated and in serious need for maintenance work. The beds are OK, but the rest of the room is old, out of style, ... the bathrooms had plumbing issues. The airport shuttle was slow. They have a great location and the potential to be OK, but they do not even seen to be trying."""
"2,""Staff and Doctors were very nice and helpful.  I enjoyed the experience with choosing my frames.  I also enjoyed the frames they carried.  I am a guy that likes more of a sporty look and I loved that fact that they carried some nice Oakley frames.  I will definitely continue to be a patient of their's."""
"2,""This is my REI of  choice in the Valley.  Mostly due to its proximity.  But I have been coming to this location since I lived in the wilds of Northern AZ and would make my way into the valley on the occasional escape to socialize.  REI was my decompression chamber of sorts  before I hit the mall and then hit the town....\nFour years later I am back in AZ and actually living in Phoenix and this REI is my goto place to look for everything from quality outdoor gear or practictical quality clothing."""
"1,""Very rude sales person on the floor very rudely told my three year old child that riding the child's bike that was on display was not allowed and physically stopped her from doing so while myself and my husband were standing right there. She did not offer any assistance and rolled her eyes when I displayed my disapproval of her talking down to my child. Will not be returning to this location and possibly REI entirely."""
"1,""This place is great for last minute things when going out for a weekend adventure but it's not the size of the store or the selection they offer that bothers me about this location...it's the lack of customer service. I've been into this store multiple times and have never been acknowledged. No \""""hello\"""" or \""""can I help you find something?\"""" I've been in, looked for what I wanted, waited for assistance, and have walked out every time without making a purchase or speaking to an employee. That's not good customer service....anywhere."""
"1,""They don't allow parents to go in the room with the kids. Something about they want the kids to get \""""comfortable\"""" with them. What?????????????? Umm... no thanx!"""
"2,""This place is pretty good! It might be all manicures, but mine chipped in about 2 days. But, it's cheap and they do a good job. The manicure looked great and professional. My toes look awesome too, and those always last a long time! \nThe only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because they made me walk to an ATM to pay in cash when they do take credit cards, they just prefer cash. I didn't appreciate the inconvenience. \nAlso, the hot rocks were burning my arms and so I pulled away. The man doing the manicure sort of laughed at me and then ridiculed me for not \""""speaking up\"""" and telling me that I need to speak up about things. How about you just use less hot rocks? That's not the type of person I am to yell at people about things, sorry! \nThey didn't hurt me at all, which is rare for me, so that's definitely a bonus. But, I recommend not letting them do the callus treatment, it made my feet worse!"""
"2,""Nothing fancy- just a regular nail salon but I have had consistent experiences which I am a fan of. Starting going here with Groupon but will continue to go. I like getting gel manicures- they are quick, steady hands, and I am in and out within 30-60 minutes. I would recommend making an appointment because it can get pretty busy but you can also just walk in if you have some time to wait."""
"1,""I decided to try this place because they have a yelp coupon ($35 for $50) and it was open today on Easter.  When I walked in they told me that the coupon isn't valid on weekends (which wasn't specified on the coupon or website) but they decided to honor it regardless (+1 star). I was thankful that they honored the coupon but I was dissatisfied with the gel manicure. The man who did my gel pedicure was excellent (+1 star). My gel manicure was a disaster, first the lady had to re-do my right thumb 3 times because the gel Polish kept bubbling and sliding. Probably because she kept me seated at the pedicure station instead of moving me a to a table. And instead of fixing two other fingers on my left hand (they have a weird ridge going along the nail bed) she just left them (probably out of frustration). I didn't complain because at that point I have been there for a while and could tell she was just over fixing my manicure. My advice would be to skip this place for a gel manicure and get the guy to do your pedicure."""
"2,""Darryl the really tall manager, he's the best! I will comeback only because of his service and the attention to details. Cheap drinks and tacos... The pizzas are good but the tacos are amazing! Try the potato ones..."""
"2,""I found this dentist office through Yelp and the awesome reviews were spot on! :) Dr Amy and Kristen were great! \n\nDr Amy was so attentive and didn't try to \""""sell\"""" me on anything like other dentists in the past have. She has a genuine interest in your smile, health and helping you save money. Most \""""new patient appointments\"""" are simply the x-rays, poking and prodding but they did all of the exam PLUS the cleaning all at the same appointment. To me, this was awesome and made the most sense instead of just scheduling to come back yet again just for the cleaning which is what most other dentists have done in the past in my experience. \n\nIn addition, I was able to watch \""""Friends\"""" while getting my cleaning done with headphones on so I could zone out and not try to not make eye contact/have an awkward drooly conversation while they are in your mouth. Side note,  why is it that dentists want to ask you questions when they are all in your mouth? Ha!  :) That really helped take the ease off and made it a much more pleasant experience. \""""Friends\"""" makes everything better after all "
"2,""This is a good dive bar with friendly bartenders and good cheap food. If you blink you may drive past it. I come here once in a while when I am in the neighborhood and don't want to deal the Mill Ave phonies...."""
"2,""In addition to the name, which I love by the way, I really liked this place.  I went here with some coworkers after work for a couple of beers.  There were five of us, we each got an appetizer and each had two or more beers apiece and our tab was $50.  Not too bad for a couple hours of drinking on the patio.  They have a pretty decent selection of food and we all seemed to enjoy our fare (nothing special, just your typical bar food), and they offer mini pitchers of beer (I love that).\n\nMy only complaint is that they allow smoking on their patio.  It's just gross.  But, the patio is big enough that we just moved \""""upwind\"""" from the smokers and we were fine.  \n\nThis would be a great spot to go watch a couple of games on the patio in the gorgeous weather and have a few drinks.  I'll be back again."""
"1,""I went here for a friends birthday and must say that it will be the last time I ever go to Pranksters. Maybe I'm new to the bar scene, but having servers with attitudes and being bitchy to customers isn't my idea of a good time. My friend ordered a water, another friend ordered an iced tea, and I ordered a cider. It was hot outside, so it would be a nice break, right? Well 30 minutes later there is no sight of our waitress and no drinks. She finally comes out with an iced tea and walks away, but not before we flag her down. Turns out she forgot our orders even though she had the receipts. She did apologize, but it still took her 5 MORE minutes to bring a water and 10 minutes to bring a cider.  Another friend was trying to order and she completely ignored him. She didn't show up until closing time (2 hour later) to give us checks and shoo us all out. I went to use the bathroom on the way out and had a waitress look me straight in the eye and say \""""UGH, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A CLOSING TIME\"""". I'm sure there are nicer waitresses working there and maybe they were just having a bad night, but that was more than I wanted to deal with and the WORST service I've ever gotten anywhere, period. I won't be going back."""
"2,""Connie and the rest of the staff were amazing! We didn't know exactly what we were looking for, but she walked us through all of our options, and the plaque came out looking fantastic. The price was great, the staff was very knowledgeable, and they really went the extra mile for us. When Connie found out this was a surprise gift, she even made sure to call my cell phone before emailing me any questions or proofs, just in case I wasn't the only one at my computer. I would recommend Tempe Trophy to everyone!"""
"2,""Really great little Breakfast/Lunch place tucked into one of the most industrial parts of Tempe.  You might not even know it was there were it not for a few covered tables on a make shift patio.  Really great food, super prices and almost disgustingly nice people who work there!  \n\nThe place is so cute.  Black and white checkered tiles.  White bead board up to a chair rail.  Very homey without being overly kitschy.  \n\nWhile they do all the basics, and do them well, this isn't just your basic fare.  How about their Muffelatta for $5.15?  Or their Hot Sweet Italian sandwich - with sausage, onion, peppers and mushrooms w/ melted provolone cheese ($5.85)?  And their Spinach salad with egg and bacon for $5.05?  All good.  They even have a Monte Cristo ($5.15) on their menu! And their basics are great.  I had the Tuna melt ($5.05) on an employee's recommendation and it's one of the best one's I've had in a long time.  I haven't had their breakfasts yet, but I've got my eye on their Egg, Chorizo and roasted green chile wrap for $3.25.  \n\nAnd then there are their drinks.  Sure - when I saw I could get Hires Root Beer or Squirt with my lunch, I was stoked.  But then I saw their coffee menu.  How about a large (32oz) Iced Coffee for $2.25? Or a large Iced Chai for $2.05???  They also Cappuccino, Espresso and Lattes for similarly great prices.  \n\nBut in the end, it's the folks who work there that have knocked me out. My first time there, the girl who took my order remembered my name and checked on me twice at my table - by name.  She wasn't a waitress, just worked behind the counter.  But when she came to clear a table, she just wanted to check on things.  \n\nI almost hate to give the place up, but the more folks who come by, the more likely I am to be able to keep this place around.  So I definitely encourage you to come by.  Even if it's to just grab a coffee and a baked good.  Yes - they bake things fresh on site every day.  Just one more layer of their oh so goodness.  If only they were open on Saturday...\n\nHours: M-F, 6am-3pm"""
"2,""Great service, such nice welcoming people. I had breakfast here and would love if they got a better syrup. The have that regular very thin semi sweet syrup and my plate would have been amazing if I had some aunt jemima or something. Would definitely go back! Wish this place was in California!"""
"2,""By far the best office max location I have been to. Always greeted and asked right away of I need help finding something, and when I tell them what I want they promptly tell me where it is. There is never a line, and so far they always have what I need"""
"1,""In a word...grody.\n\nThe second I walked in the door I was lambasted by a serious stank. It smelled like sewage and industrial cleaners. I should have done an about face at this time but I foolishly pressed on.\n\nI ordered the Red Devil white calzone, which was advertised as mozzarella, olive oil, fresh Roma tomatoes and garlic. The mozzarella was over abundant and flavorless, the tomatoes were mealy, underripe and were decidedly not Romas (likely Beefsteak or Mountain Pride). The garlic was nearly raw and jammed into the calzone by the fistfull. \n\nI'm not a restaurateur but in my estimation the two most oft repeated sins of Italian restaurants is to not make their mozzarella in house and to overload every dish with garlic. Mozzarella is easy and inexpensive to make and I love garlic but there is definitely such a thing as too much.\n\nI will not be returning to this location. However it should be noted that I ate at the Pinetop location last year and both the food and the ambiance were excellent."""
"1,""I just sent the following message through their website.  I'll update when I receive a reply.  Only 2 stars because not a fan of sausage and lack of an on the spot appropriate response.\n\nJust picked up my pizza from your take out window at the Mill and Southern location.  Order #48, medium pepperoni and MUSHROOM order, and received a pepperoni and SAUSAGE pizza.\n\nOrder was placed by phone, employee name not given (or asked for), order repeated back correctly, but still the wrong toppings.\n\nWhen this was mentioned to the cashier, his reply was \""""I did not take the order\""""  and \""""I can make another one\"""".  Not sincere, did not look me in the eye.  I work and cannot wait the additional time for the correct order to be made.  Why not an offer to discount the one wrong topping?\n\nIt's going to be a long weekend of SAUSAGE.  Kind of dissapointing."""
