Review_new
i got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods not a good book to pick up occasionally takes a focussed reading and thats just one of the series.
i was dissatisfied with this novel being an avid fan of asimov and the foundation seriesthe younger version of the mathimatical genius did not match with older one who changed the history of his race for the bette.
setup was easy enough but this printer routinely goes haywire spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print i have tried it with several different pcs with this same intermittent weird behavior only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everythingim off to buy an epson.
not much of a challenge to read enjoyed it just the same it was a change from the modern world and therefore i recommend it.
this just plain bad boring i did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting it was a waste of my time.
go break open a red light camera and steal the film watch that it will have  times better acting and a much more coherent plot too.
what a terrible movie garbage it totally sucks what is hollywood coming to it seems they are running out of stories to make movies about what garbage good lord right up there with boondock saints  and smokin aces .
there is not one redeemable quality about this film period nicolas cage is at the bottom of the barrel he now has absolutely no range the acting in this was worse than a low budget b movie i think he seriously was on something so here we are new orleans post katrina nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble i couldnt figure out who was coming or going i was baffled the entire movie the lines were horrible please save your money.
so hes a dirty cop and an all around horrible person spoiler everything worked out in the end what the heck was the point of that movie seriously everything worked out in the endi dont know why i continued to watch.
i think the above review needs a corrective tynan was the sharpest funniest and bestinformed theatre critic of his generation he was also a wonderful stylist and a precocious one many writers never write as well as tynan did while still in his teens these letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language but theres more to them than that tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider as someone pushing the envelop.
mykel board  punk rocker new yorker gonzo provocateur  fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to mongolia for one year to teach englishand im so glad he did his easytoread writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny from his problems overcoming constipation because metamucil is not sold in outer mongolia board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea to his visits to mongolian dance clubs to the confusing hurdles presented in this postsoviet limbo land welcome to mongolia is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention unlike most travel memoirs there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture  even though there were times that i a fellow traveler longed for mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country  making this book a fun unrestrained ride through a remote kafkaesque kingdom buy this book.
no im not making this up somebody actually produced this recording actually two people produced it nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it i say nearly because most of the tracks were played by a trio who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet im not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining these folks certainly were not up to the task the end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties unbelievable.
i find this item to be more than expectedand i think everyone should consider buying onei will tell everyone about it.
wow words can barely express the awesomeness of this piece first i will start with the movie brilliant that is all there is to be said about the film now the ost beautiful work a very dark and somber piece very moody and atmospheric its not something you just listen to for fun at least for me its more of a background music while doing your business its just brilliant every track in amazing from beginning to end i was unfamiliar with johnny klimek and reinhold heilds work this cd however makes me want to definatly look into it it is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film some tracks are very tranquil and moody while others pound out beats and are very fast paced all in all a  for the cd a definate must have for any collection highly recommneded.
its a very nice camera dont get me wrong however due to its compact design the speaker is too close to the tape motor during quiet and not so quiet areas you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record canon confirmed this as a design flaw the zr  and  all do this i was really disappointed i returned mine i wish there was a way to fix it.
brio is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market these pieces are a must for extending your existing train set my  year old loves having these extra pieces to create with.
i know the whole point of dummie and kiss books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simpletoo basic i read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse if i hadnt gotten this book for a steal i would have been very upset at my waste of money there was just no real information what a waste.
i always goes with the trip lite fiber patch cables due to their quality and not being so proud of their name they triple the price.
big waste of money after washing noticed  pillow case was a different shade and so wrinkled no matter what ive tried stuck with it since i washed and cant find packaging.
ive been very happy with this easy to use and clean grill ive used it to grill steaks duck breasts veggies and chicken takes longer than a gas grill but gets to job done without smoking up the kitchen.
couldnt agree more w prendergasts review concerning the laughable typos i thought the proof reader or editor of the version i had must be abusing drugs themselves how distracting to read a so called classic and find it reading like a hs sophomore paper  and a drunk sophomore at that i somehow managed to finish the book but came on amazon immediately following it to see if others read the same erroneous version weird typos poor punctuation etc ruined it for me.
the main reason why i waited up until  in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice tgreat action and i was dissapionted when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes  mabye she isso it was very entaining worth a watch.
dont know if anyone else has addresed this i have been building my barn shop for  years now the book covers many of my thoughts and concerns would have wanted this sooner than later points raised for consideration noise and sound i put in some wood walls painted white and sealed against moisture but i fussed with that or drywall i considered my own sound issues and went with wood but after reading some of the authors comments i will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when i do other parts of the shop not for me alone but for my nieghbors as well good book to read before during or contemplating a shop hey we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well.
dont buy this video with dvd technology it would have been a nobrainer to provide both sound tracks the original aussie version and the rotten american dubbed version these dopes chose to give us the one that nobody wants perhaps if nobody buys it theyll get a clue.
this is probably mel gibsons first film a film hes done while he was in his s there is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native australia but this film launched him as an international movie star especially since they released mad max  which was universally released as the road warrior and the road warrior is one of my top ten favorite films of the ssure mad max has some of that cheesy seventies style but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made todaymad max is that one film being over  years old that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than  years old today this film is a classic in the action hero dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre.
ive seen mad max dozens of times but after watching the new se dvd it was like watching it again for the very first time that is not an exaggeration the new dvd offers the choice of the poorly dubbed us soundtrack or the original australian soundtrack watch the original track the pacing of the film changes entirely as do the characters the original soundtrack breathes new life into this filmthe features are great theres a trivia track that pops up info about the production cars and aussie slang terms used as you watch it  documentaries tv spots theater trailer and morethe print is fabulous and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen having seen it both ways now i can tell you that the pan  scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action if youve seen this movie in the past and thought it was ok this new dvd will have you saying it was great.
this was the absolute worst book that i have ever read it the dullest most boring thing since i learned algebra after the first chapter i already wanted to kill myself but i gave it another chance and another and another and another i was continually dissapointecd do not waste your hard earned money on this aboration of a book.
ever since i got this album since last summer i kept on thinking what this album will sound like i never wanted to stop listening to this album because their music is so spectacular if you heard the first track laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer it reminds me of the beatles eerie song revolution  from the white album i couldve just imagined while listening to baby lulu and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds this is the best album ive ever heard and i listen to this album while i study and you should listen to this while youre at work or home stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them byebye .
this is a very funny movie that stars martin short as murray a bumbling fairy godmother who can hardly do anything right his first job is helping anabel greening played by mara wilson anabels wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical and she wants him to get the part unfortunately murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue when anabel her brother charlie and murray go to nafgaa and tell the queen of the fairy godmothers what happened she tells anabel that if they dont reverse the spell by midnight he will remain a statue forever before they can do that they have to get the wands back from the evil claudia i highly recommend a simple wish.
the kids loved this movie martin short is hillarious the fact that it still teaches kids you dont always get what you ask for.
this movie has the little girl from matilda and martin short good family picture  we loved it came in excellent condition.
i have known kenneth copland since  he has always set very high standards for the recording  prpduction of all his albums this album is no exception.
trout fishing in america make kids music they do it well and the album probably will stand up to the death play the kids will give it even with adults although i highly doubt many adults will listen to it for its own merits if you need a cd for your kids to listen to that wont drive you crazy you have found it but otherwise this is probably not a cd you want to own.
it always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly overpriced items on here you can bet ill never buy anything from this vendor even if it is a great dealthis is a ridiculously high price for red bull on sale in the stores one can find it for can why would someone pay more than that online caveat emptor  let the buyer beware.
i also really loved the book it showed two strong willed people who are at first glance totally wrong for each other i mean a centuries old vampire and a vampire slayer it was ironic i also liked that even though quin was a cold fish on the outside inside he was just as lonely as rashel even if he rarely admitted it i loved the book and couldnt put it down if u havent read it yet do so.
the performances seem fine the recording is a mess the woodwinds are lost in the intro to festive overture because there is too much reverberation the mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall more like a cavern this is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding this is a one listen cd then file it away forever.
in the merrill way these are great shoes as my daughter says merrills are a hug for the feet even though there are minimal straps they are in the right places and adjustable these go everywhere i love them.
the book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice in the process bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a wholefor me personally this is possibly the most important vietnam book ive read this is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war from the beginning of american involvement to the end that i still usefor many readers this could be an important first book to read about vietnam and americas relations to it.
this is yet another lush shimmering pscyoerotic opera by franz schreker wonderfully performed by the forces involved  i suggest you just read the review of  to get a good summary of the surreal plot at least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composers masterpiece die gezeichneten and while i wouldnt disagree with that judgement this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling particularly in the second half other than mozart bizets carmen and a small handful of others im not a great opera fan but schrekers output in this genre to be absolutely stunning highly recommended.
works great just snap it into the slot and turn on my pc in a few seconds i was up and running and my pc working much faster that before.
i got a huge kick out of vinnys interpretations of the beatles songs that they never recorded sure they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped as has been written here but the dont mimic previous covers but try to recreate the early beatle sound its light and its fun its is not a must have as a beatles fan but i think youll get a big kick out of this disc.
madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical she is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of lament it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality while in the song beuonos aires she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention she is a great actor if i could change one thing it would be to switch jimmy nail and jonathin pryce because nail should sing more songs and price should sing less.
all i can say is wow i never thought madonna could sing like this now i am a huge fan of hers antonio banderass accent makes him fit the part of che very nicely the songs are incomparable if i could change one thing it would be jonathan pryce because he has an annoying voice.
after returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them in trying to overcome this through hps support line the recorded message said i would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call twice returned that version also.
this is a text book that i will not be selling back i like the reference style setup with tabbed pages i am sure i will be referring to it throughout the rest of my college courses.
i had to try sleeping on it the first night  in a couple of hours it was less firm which made it difficult to roll around on it didnt take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistakereturning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough prospective buyers should be mindful of this.
we used this for less than  days for a guest it does everything as advertised except that it began to leak ai.
i purchased a twin size intex pillow airbed and was so impressed with the quality that i ordered a second it was easy to inflate held its firmness was very easy to take down and easily stored now when my granddaughters come to visit they have their own bed and great pajama parties.
i highly recommend this item and its a great price with amazon primemy son uses this whenever he sleeps over he loves it says that its like sleeping on a cloud with the electric pump which is attached it inflates and deflates super fast it also folds up into a rather small rectangle and it comes with a canvas bag for store.
i found this air bed to be perfect for  person the ease in filling the height all exceptionali would reccomend this bed to anyone.
this product is very difficult for me to use the air pump does not connect easily and i would not recommend it.
bought this for my grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over christmas it is wonderful   super easy to inflate and deflate nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable grandma scored a home run on this one.
excellent value for the money convenient and comfortable i just wish it was a little higher i would recommend this product.
inflates like a charm then deflates under the weight of a child within  hours i should have gone with my gut and purchased another aerobed because the one i already have queen has worked for   years.
i have purchased two of these air mattresses when inflated they are great but during the night they slowing deflate i have yet to discover how to keep these mattresses inflated for eight full hours i wish i would have bought a different air mattress.
my mother bought this bed for my  year old to use when we visited on weekends worked great the first  or so times she used it but now the valve that lets the air out wont close it spins but does not seal shut so you cant inflate the mattress very poor quality.
funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicasrecomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armadomuy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento no esnecesario nada mas para utilizarlo.
this is the third mattress in  or  weeks and had the same problem with all three they all leaked right from the beginning some worse then the others the built in pump worked great and i liked it very much thus the  stars instead of one star i am very thankful for amazons great return policy it was really a pleasure to deal with them.
we bought these beds in september for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit they are  and  and weigh under  pounds these beds can not make it through one single night inflated we either have to get up during the night and reinflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortableweve had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselvesim very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since its clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years agomy opinion is save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on thats what were doing now.
i bought this air mattress after researching the site it is indeed very comfortable and easy to operate and most important of all no leaking.
i saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase we ordered two twins for our camp mine started leaking immediately my husbands seemed to be good from spring to nearly winter when his too began to leak so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat that was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge my father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again our camp closes down during winter so spring will be the big test i suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe theres hope.
the air mattress does blow up in seconds it is comfortable it is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money my daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night.
my daughter is living with a couple for the summer this was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed  miles to their house she has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use that is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back as a college student and missions student im sure it will be used again.
this bed is so easy to use just plug it in turn it on and walk away the pump is built in so you dont have to worry about keeping up with an air pump using a hairdryer or finding double d batteries to power your pump.
we recently moved into a smaller place when my parents came into town they took my oldest sons room we needed something for him to sleep on but didnt have much room this twin airbed by intex is great i love the fact that the pump is built in it doesnt get in the way like i thought it might my son says its very comfortable its easy to inflate and deflate.
i needed to replace my airbed but didnt want to spend a fortune this one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones i found in my local bed and bath store.
i just moved out of my moms house and i didnt want to bring my huge beddressar with me so i got the airbed its been  months since i moved out and im still sleeping on it you can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed i like mine halfway deflated its like sleeping on a cloud.
took it to france and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew bought a hand pump to pump it up it was a painful job after it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box.
durable and extremely comfortable loses a little air over extended use but adding air very easy.
i am in iraq and this mattress is great it is x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.
i bought this for my off campus residence and the two months it worked fineand then the problems began first two the curves on the top not sure what exactly they are called merged into one so i had to sleep on one half of the bed recently i noticed it was starting to sink and reinflated it shortly afterward i heard some air and found where it was leaking and didnt think too much off it then in the middle of sleeping i woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up then i found out that the main support line is for their pools i would recommend a different brand like coleman or getting something from cabelas.
i bought this airbed on october  i only used it  times and now is loosing air how can it loose air like that with only  uses at the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall but now i cant use it anymore unless i want fill it with air at the middle of the night.
i love this air mattress so much it is so easy to inflate and deflate and it is quick too it is very sturdy and durable as well over all it is an excellent gift to anyone who expects to travel and stay over at someones place or even if you have a lot of guests yourself.
bought the intex pillow rest for visitsvisitors inflation is quick quiet and easy deflation works the same slight loss of air by early morning fits back into tote nicely take an extra moment when flattened to tuck the sides between the upper and lower fabric fold in thirds length wise then role from bottom toward pumppillow end easy to tote and store.
i bought this to replace my queen size intex bed that exploded inside only lasted months i like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size i think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside the twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger if youre looking for a bed for just yourself this should be perfect.
i have been a fan of step rideau and the zydeco outlaws since i purchased their cd standing room only im so glad has quickly become my favorite some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco this is a must buy for zydeco lovers if the grammys had a catagory for zydeco step would win for performer of the year.
i paid  at comp usa known for being overpriced over a year agoanyways the case doesnt get the best air so id recommend getting more fansif you have problems with the front usb hubs pc freezes when you plug something in them unplug the very bottom black wirerrwwggbbb.
very good comprehensive review on the band gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written a good addition to my collection.
not what i thought i was getting i dont think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately i had to pay to find out.
it was good is not like out of this world and really amazing but it works soooooo good if you put a lot of pressure when your using it it turns off automatically that sucks.
i used it once and have not touched it since the dolfin wont stay on my clit and the clear stuuf is too soft waste of money.
this product worked for  times the the rotation stopped working batteries run out or lose power after  uses i would read reviews before buying another one i am looking into the hitachi wand massager now and i believe i will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of powernot impressed with this product.
what a let down i was so excited to get this because of the reviews but when i tried it it did nothing first it is very heavy and hard to hold if you are using it by yourself second it hurts your clitoris it is very sharp on the ears thats the part that goes on you clit im almost temped to cut them off third and forth it smells and it is very loudive tried it about  times trying to get used to it my husband has tried to use it on me too no luck at all this is not worth the money.
for those wondering like myself this does come in a discrete package now as for the actual product omg ive never felt something like this before this is my first official toy and i am sooooo pleased its a little large and kinda hard but thats okay works wonderfully i would definitely recommend especially for the price.
this was much bigger then i had anticipated that being my own fault but the reason i gave it only  star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt the bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable so my man suggested i turn it around and then my taint became irritated not one bit pleased with this product.
while i love the jack rabbit feature the vibrator is overall too big for me to use i can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable maybe because its too big i cannot feel the beads at all i dont think they have any room to move the vibrator is also quite heavy it would be perfect if it were more slender so girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product.
i was misguided by the review ratings in all honesty this product is awful it has a toxic smell to it and the bunny ears cause more pain than pleasure i dont recommend this product.
i am very hard to please because i like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration this item does not work for what i intended it for i tried it twice and hated it both times i was so worked up from trying to make it work that i had to switch back to my bullet i gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol she loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me.
this is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality  i got the clear one cause like other reviews say your eye really doesnt jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubblegum my first vibrator hahahaits really quiet for something that movesdoes so much and it is more powerful than i expected i had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration  but even that got the job down in  seconds yeah i timed it this might take some getting used to for some but i absolutely love itthe only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more lifted off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one people have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have a smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale  and it went away after  or  washesi highly recommend buying this.
this album contains danceable techno and mellow techno tranceyambient unlike most albums all of the songs on this album are great youll definitely get your moneys worth from this album and even though its over  years old the music still sounds brilliant like michael stipe of rem said this album was several years ahead of its time.
i received this as a christmas gift from a friend who knows i like hot tea all of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea i avoid drinking caffein which green tea contains so i gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections the chest is kind of cheap paper glued over something as described by another reviewer its pretty but i dont expect it to hold up.
this book gives a great look into the jewish mindset of the early s a must read for any young bible student.
this is a good double cd packed with alot of favorites i liked slot of her dialouges between songs her words  messages are invaluble  timeless il divo accompanies her on several songs like evergreen i would have preferred her to sing that one alone the music of the night   somewhere not favorable with il divo.
ok first of all i was looking for lighthouse the classic poprock group there was nothing to tell me that this album was a gospel cdok i can live with thatso i listen to my new lighthouse gospel cd let me tell you i was not impressed the engineering sucked the music was mmmmmmm ok i guess and the singing really had no feeling or substance behind itso if you are into gospel steer clean and if you are looking for lighthouse the classic poprock group this is not itlatter.
there was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the watchtower toys with  action figures we thought that the  action figures were included  they were not also do not be fooled by the too good to be true price they charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a storeotherwise the package arrived in a timely manner was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier.
if you get to this review please please do not spend your hard earned money on this toy even at half price it is not worth it i faced the same problems as everyone else im forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box a watse of money nuff said.
after an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up the legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open this was a major disapointment we returned it the next day in pieces.
picked one of these up the other day mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller but thats all it has is looksafter using the keyboard it quickly became tedious to use since not only are the keys hard to push down they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places and the wireless is hit and miss possibly because it runs at only mhz frequency it will miss keys here and there so you have to type very slooow and check your work very often and with passwords where you cant see what you are typing good luck it quickly becomes a tire there is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll featurethe processor is  generations older than the current dual core intel processors and the ram is standard ddr instead of ddrunless hp updates the components and the keyboard this is a terrible value and a pos.
i downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter the authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing american with london slang honestly it was the dumbest book ive tried to read in a long time at least download the sample first.
fast delivery of all products we just received the bunn coffee maker this is the fourth bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years great product the book and the hair iron were gifts so we dont know how they were liked.
