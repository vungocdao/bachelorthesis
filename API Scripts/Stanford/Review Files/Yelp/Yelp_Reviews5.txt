best sushi ive had so far in charlotte make sure you try their coastal rol.
horrible college good luck going there or getting help when you needi it the only person i found to be helpful was brad and he simply shouldnt have to do anybodies job i will def be contacting higher management due to the lack of communication i have recieved i do not reccommend this school to anyone who is looking to further their education i have never seen such a horrible community college in my life time.
although the price is right and the fried rice is pretty good its severely overshadowed by the off taste of the beef and chicken dishes  the beef with scallion is  bamboo shoots which isnt even listed as an ingredient and the dumplings are incredible hulking globs.
i cant say my expectations were too high but i definitely expected better  my cashew chicken was inedible and i was only able to eat the fried rice and egg roll which were fine  the chicken was so chewy that i could not bring myself to take a second bite  will not go back.
had the pasta special last night at mamas and it was unreal  pure breast meat chicken bolognese in a tomato sauce with perfectly cooked rigatoni chef drew hits another home run.
ive eaten there twice now and really enjoyed it both times this is exceptional because im not a big fan of italian cuisine we ordered our food family style both times lots of food and lots of fun that way   we had the chicken parm the chicken carciofi and the cheese ravioli all were outstanding especially having been preceded with the tuscan salad and mamas salad fanatastico  great food and great service ill go back again if im in downtown charlotte in the future.
horrible customer service unless you are into horror movies or the simpsons the people working the counter cant give you a honest review however they will make fun of your movie selections and treat you like crap cant wait to go back.
i have to disagree with these other reviews  presbyterian is a joke  unfortunately our primary care physician is right around the corner and affiliated with presbyterian as well and so any time they want to order up something that they cant handle in the office guess where they send us  to make matters worse the place is always full or overfull always understaffed and always incapable of handling anything  the emergency department is horrid but to make matters worse its better than being admitted  in one of the worst cases of mismanagement ever what should have been a simple examination  passed from our regular doctor  ended up being at least  hours in the emergency room while we waited for a regular room then several days yes days in the hospital itself while they proceeded to run a whopping one test per day  thats right  one test per day  the test would usually be run in midmorning and the results would come back midafternoon at which point they would try and find someone to interpret the test results which could take until after dinner and by the time that happened it would be night time and then another test would be ordered for the next day  it was simply pathetic  whatever you do do not go to the emergency room at presbyterian.
though im a copper enthusiast when it comes to getting my indian fix in charlotte id heard that maharani was a cheaper but tasty option so we ordered from there a few nights ago   copper is definitely still my place but maharani was fine enough first of all the food came very quickly which is rare usually indian food good indian good takes at least  minutes we got our order in like  which was great cause we were starving   the tikka masala was spicy and pretty good but it wasnt as thick and saucy as i like the salad was just soso the naan were all amazing definitely the highlight.
ate there recently for dinner it was wonderful i ordered the goat curry and was excited to try goat for the first time right after i found out it is the most consumed meat on earth outside of the us but the table of  indian gentleman behind us had ordered it allwhich led me to believe these guys know what they are doing instead i tried the lamb and it was perfect i really liked the candor of our waiter andrew which was not his name but he called himself that with a grinning smir.
this was absolutely terrible  it was so highly reviewed but absolutely terrible  not that we ate the food because we never had a chance  we were seated immediately in an area with another table that was served by our server  there were only two tables taken in the restaurant and our server took  minutes to bring us drinks  still waiting on our drinks our appetizer came out with no silverware no plates still no drinks  our server came by we had already asked him about the drinks once  shortly thereafter he brought the drinks still no plates and no silverware  we waited a few more minutes and he brought out our salads  still no plates and no silverware  when we asked again about the plates he laughed as though we had made some strange request  we continued to wait  no chopsticks no silverware no plates  after it became too ridiculous to handle we got up and walked out  its the only place that weve ever done that before  and we have had some terrible service  the food that we stared at looked terrible  in hindsight im glad that we had no utensils  if you have an hour to kill are looking for terrible service arent in a rush and want to order some food that looks disgusting you may want to check it ou.
i ordered take out of tom yum soup and chilli chicken what a disappointment none of these tasted good tom yum soup was kinda disgusting.
i have been to this place a few times and enjoyed the flavors however i was very disappointed for their lack of respect to what a customer orders  i order my usual the mee goreng with tofu and as i combed through and had a couple of bites i found a strip of chicken  i lost my appetite and was gravely disappointed by their lack of detail to a vegetarian dish  this place is black listed for me and i hope to find a better malaysian place in the queen city.
this is the worst chinese restaurant that i have ever eaten at  i went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed  i dont write many reviews but i didnt want someone to get suckered in like i did    the one good thing that i will say about this restaurant was that the food was very cheap  however i could not stomach but a few bites so i still did not get my moneys worth.
meh ive experienced better the staff is friendly just basic chinese food.
this place is ok the people who work there are amazing though they love what they do and they enjoy helping you they have a great comic book selection however i wish they carried more toys   sadly this placed is owned by a guy who only cares about profit and not customer service kind of a jerk.
best place in charlotte for comics hands down sadly not the best place to go for a friendly staff condescending tones and mockery of things i asked forwas inquiring about are not a good way to get return business  ill buy online before i go in here again.
great tailoring hands down ive had jeans taken in dresses altered and hems taken up  all perfectly done i will say though that you get what you pay for ie its not affordable tailoring  a pair of jeans cost  to be taken in and  for hemmed pants or dress while i personally think its worth it for expert tailoring others may think its a bit overpriced for some of the basic tailoring   also the staff are all very nice and will give very helpful tailoring advice when asked you can trust your nicest pieces here  they are in good hands.
i did not use his service because he told me that the corrections that i needed in my clothes would not look good after  he could have just done it and take the money but he preferred to advise me and not do the work definitely will be back when i need something to be done.
i really really want to like showmars because its local but its just kind of icky in the environment it was probably a unique spot before they spread all over the area but now that charlotte is supersaturated its just not that interesting   the french fries are ok i guess the veggie pita is no goodclearly designed by someone who has never eaten food without meat on it maybe i was disappointed because i had high expectations and maybe its an alright place for the meateatersbut its just not good for me i havent had a good experience and ive been to a few locations i wont be going back.
good food friendly staff good prices  i love the chicken and broc  generals chicken is good but not great this is a staple in my diet since i live so close.
my cookie had no fortune.
hoho cherry house not to be confused with a brothel offers average food at cheap prices fast delivery and friendly staff no matter what protein you pick it pretty much tastes the same.
monday night drink specials and an amazingly musical performance will be provided to you with a  dollar cover what more could you ask for   this building breeds history and i was proud to experience it my last night in charlotte.
i wasnt quite sure what to expect from this place  seeing some of the patrons walking into this place dressed up and at the same time seeing a giant alligator statue sitting in a throne in the front yard  once inside its actually a really nice place  the service is great the waitresses are very friendly and attentive and really cared that we had a good time  there is live music on some nights which always makes for a good time  looking at the other reviews i think the food is kind of hit or miss  i guess i was lucky with the red beans and rice it was really good by my standards at least.
love the etouffee the chicken with rice and beans is amazing i cant wait to go back i love the casual feel and the food is just down right good.
the service is great the food is great  theres not really anything i can add that hasnt been said in the other reviews  other than  if you dont order the beignets for brunch you are seriously insensue  thats insane in french  i think.
so earlier this year i bought a coupon off of google offers for cajun queen i had never been here and wanted to try it so  for  worth of food was a great incentive it took me until last week to give it a try   the atmosphere was dark and a bit drab the art on the walls was nice but i was here for food the menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive the prices were on the high side of expensive thank goodness for the coupon   service was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere i could have used a smile from someone but it didnt come the portions that came with my meal were just the way i like them not too much but enough for a good dinner the flavor of the oysters and shrimp was above satisfactory   all in all the trip was worth it but with the coupon i would have kicked myself if i had to pay full price for the experience received that being said i doubt i will be returning on my own accord.
im not an avid gokarter but ive been enough times to know what to expect  this gokart establishment is by far the worst that ive been to ive been to go karting in places in la boston and vegas and what all of those places had that this lacked was a safetytraining personvideo to tell you what the safety rules are  this place all you do is sign up via computer pay your way and you not guided look for the entrance to put your track suit on no one in the room to tell you what to put on no one in the room to tell you where to go so you find your way to the track and wait in the line to drive again no training video no guide to tell you what is what what the rules are etc you just get in your car and drive i wouldnt mind the lax safetysecurity procedures so much if my brother and i didnt get yelled at by the managerowner on the track his exact words were where on planet earth can you still drive with yellow lights flashing  if im expected to stop at yellow lights on your track youve got to tell me before we start racing backstory the yellow lights were on because someone crashe.
i must say i am very disappointed with the way its establishment is ran we had a group of kids  some with experience and some not then they put  adults in the adult kart and ran all over the kids and ran almost  sec faster not a safe experience for the younger kids.
replacing an unsuccessful print and framing shop on the corner of th and north davidson tattoo artist and native charlottean joey vernon has put together a shop full of phenomenal artist  with fus custom tattoos that has become one of the busiest businesses in the noda neighborhood in the last year  the noninked can cringe and marvel at the artistry with the window booth on gallery crawls while fans of skin art can get tattooed in the open and social set up throughout the rest of the shop  or they can swing in and scope out the adjacent baku art gallery that houses some of the ink houses artists canvas works beyond the skin  in my thirteen some odd years of being tattooed and having sat for five different artist this is one of the most laid back and social tattoo parlors that i have graced  it makes for a very comfortable setting during what can prove to be a somewhat uncomfortable experience  old school traditional japanese black work et cetera  they have a stable of more than competent artist that can either translate the artwork you bring with you or create a one of a kind piece to last a lifetime  i have sat with matt terry who is insanely good and look forward to having joey work on me in the not too distant future.
i wasnt supposed to be in charlotte but canceled flights etc  you know how that goes so i spent several hours here  things i like about this airport  interesting food options and what i had was good  i never expected to be eating tasty bbq brisket beans cornbread  fried pickles at an airport restaurant    rockers  all over the place there are rocking chairs  clean open feel to the architecture  smoothly operating airport  wireless  basically if you have to be stuck at an airport id take this one over many others.
since i travel almost exclusively with us airways clt their main hub is a frequent stop and ive been flying inout of there for roughly  years now  planes usually run smoothly here no matter what section of the airport im flying out of  ive gone both domestic and international without a hassle  if you have status with us airways the fast track on the security line is a god send  the restaurants are good with some lively bars  the airport itself has a very open feel to it littered with comfortable rocking chairs should you ever want to sit a spell  shoppings decent if youre into that sort of thing  it could do with more electrical outlets for the business travelers but otherwise its a solid place.
one of my least favorite airports  the flights i end up taking into charlotte eg stl to phf invariably seem to have me jumping across a few terminals to make my connection  youd think the situation would be improved by the huge number of moving walkways connecting the different gates but there is nothing more infuriating than being stuck behind a family of four blocking the entire walkway or someone slowly trudging along on the left  for gods sake people just like on the road pass on the left walk on the right  there are people in this airport obviously not you that are in a hurry  cant speak much to the food and drink options here  the selections seem plentiful  us airways was friendly to me here too when a flight was canceled back home  they shuttled me to a nearby hotel  i forget where  and covered both my transportation and lodging for the night  good work guys.
honestly wish i could give it zero stars based on today  security is beyond the worst check in with the airline was smooth thats about it im sure its not this bad everyday or it would be on the news and or shutdown from the lack of business.
jamba juice and free wifi.
nice airport with good dining choices the us airways lounge is great too.
the two stars are bonus points but it gets the basics wrong  pro   bright airy  i never need to walk miles to get to the terminal   very cool statues greet people to the queen city those always put a smile on my face   cons   no restaurants or bars available to hang out with family and friends and wait for the often delayed departing flight thats a deal breaker for me security checks are here to stay do something about it    tsa agents are often rude and overly aggressive yes compared to other big cities    employing bathroom attendants news break hello the fifties are over    not enough airlines service charlotte or compete for its business    not enough direct flights in or out unless i want to make the trip  hours longer that need be the only direct flights to london are with usfreakingairways for a wannabe international hub thats not too famous.
i like clt  this airport is large and has a lot of people going through it and there are many places to stop in grab lunch or dinner and get to your next stop  i normally dont have much time to hang out here but i have been to a couple restaurants and they were clean and fast  i especially like the fact this airport has six starbucks locations  if you are flying from charlotte try the a concourse tsa line it is usually shorter.
thoroughly impressed with this airport   not that im some great world traveler but all the more reason  see when i booked my virgin transatlantic flight yes virgin with a lower case vas in i was popping my passport cherr.
decent selection and clearance pricing can be found at the brooks brothers store  once youre done shopping and still have some time to kill before catching your flight you can rest your bottom on one of the dozens of white rocking chairs that line the atrium  the rocking chairs are a nice perk and you should definitely try to take advantage of them if you can  the only complaint i have are with the transport carts  they are constantly beeping no matter what direction theyre going  i can understand the beeping while in reverse but its really annoying when its constant  especially when you have  minutes to kill at the gate  thank goodness for the free wifi.
easy to navigate plenty of food options careful about the distance between terminals though.
i hate us airways shitty services.
this review is solely based on my experience in the prayer room it is upstairs tucked into a quiet corner with very little foot traffic which means no interruptions the chapel as it is called is interfaith and contains a quranbible and torah available there are also prayer mats for muslims and an altar to kneel at i believe they also have have sacrament available for communion but you need to contact staff  being muslim i really appreciated the quiet serenity to be able to pray without feeling rushed to do so i used the room twice upon arrival an departure when praying the second time around i was joined by a catholic gentleman so the room does get use thank you cd airport for a blessing to passengers needing a place to pray and worship.
really need shorter waiting lines it got worse  the valet is annoying and gets in the way.
great little airport now direct connection to europe live piano music in terminal us airways hub rental car shuttles run every few minutes lots of charging stations for electronic devices airport is also small enough to make transfers easy.
its a nice airport to have a layover in free wifi is only for  minutes but there are tons of eateries shopping and even a spa  the only thing that sucks is if you have a short layover and have to run from one end of the airport to the other to make your plane  its a huge airport on my layover on my way out i did get to enjoy a great lox sandwich at einstein bros bagels   on my way back i had  minutes to get to my plane  i suppose i should have asked one of the carts for help.
disclaimer ive only passed through this airport for connection flights and ive never had much of a lay over   its not as big as many of the other hubs like detroit atlanta and minneapolis but its still big enough to need a tram of some sort ive not spotted a tram if there is one here the moving sidewalks just dont cut it when your connecting flight is already boarding many of the moving sidewalks and there are a lot of them werent working as in out of service even an escalator was out of service if youve ever wondered what its like to tote a carry on luggage up stairs ill inform you that its not very fun   the bathroom had an attendant but the bathroom wasnt as clean as many of the other airport bathrooms that ive used there werent any toilet seat covers some airports even have the rotating plastic seat covers so nothing at all is very behind in the time   there was a food court and an area that had rocking chairs that was a first time that ive noticed rocking chairs in an airport i didnt use them it was just another observation plus i was trying to note something positive about this airport.
so honest moment i was actually here for another event but what a treat it was to have it hosted such a great venue   while we waited for our event to start we were able to walk around and read a little history on the planes and models that were there by far the best attraction was the plane that was in route to charlotte and landed on the hudson after seeing the damages and reading the stories this was nothing short of a miracle   another really cool feature is that they have preserved personal items from the passengers and flight crew which is a really nice touch if youre into history aviation or just want to know more about this memorable flightyoull want to visit here.
we ordered breakfast here during a layover my croissant was literally dripping cloudy looking water  since we plopped down almost  bucks i tried forcing it down until i felt something odd in my mouth  a hair that neither matched my hairs color or ethnicity  this bk should be shut down.
sundays used to be all you can drink vodka for  dollar cover after paying our cover they let us know that beginning this week vodka drinks are  dollars why would anyone come on sunday if theyre pouring  dollar glasses of cranberry juice.
though the freedom dr kmart looks like the setting of a postapocalyptic film and the entire chain is past its prime you can find some trinkets for cheap on the inside    this kmart has some affordable home furninishing knockoffs by cheap i mean cheaper than targetikea  while it some of it is dated kmart still carries the muchtouted martha stewart brands  ive found a runner rug and bedspread that both look like something from department stores  the same can be said for the furniture so dont hate on my stylish house   the clothing department is slightly dicier but i have scavenged some faddish clothes think gap  years ago among the big bubba tshirts and overalls  their young mens section has good deals at the end of the season like utility shirts or those really metrosexual bootcut jeans for less than   yeahreally  the rest of the store is pretty much filler  if you actually go to this kmart  or any kmart looking for a decent selection of sporting goodsshoeselectronics you will likely pay more than other big box retailers or be appalled by the selection  if youre like me and approach kmart shopping like thrift store diving you will be pleasantly surprised cant decide then if visiting kmart is frugal or frivolous but who doesnt need another cheap belt.
i cant anymore its too busy here and service is not as fast as other mickey ds with this kind of volume customers are rude too.
lemme be clear  i dont own a gun  im not into shooting guns or particularly even holding one  my hands shake and i start feeling nauseous but i gotta say after being in a few different gun shops for workthis place really takes the cake    i agree with dave s  that hyatt is a very highly respected shop  its in fact one of the top  largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country  one of the store employees even printed out the article to show me   youll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls in the casesand all the employees i talked to know their stuff inside and out  i was told the story behind machine guns and the history behind certain handguns    the place is almost always packed even on black fridaywhen they dont offer any discountssales and what i admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is  the fact the customers all wait patiently and dont get madnow thats loyalty.
its old everything was pretty clean except there was a chocolate smear on the sheet sketchy really it was a fine place to stay for the ridiculously low rate breakfast had been cleaned out before  so get up super early if you want more than white bread and oj we might come back if its still cheap.
if you didnt know where it was youd miss it  dining area is sparse basic tables and booths open delistyle    got the chicken parm sub as recommended by yelpers  mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich  still not sure i would order it again  fries are standard crinklecut    summary good place as alternative to nearby fast food joints but i wouldnt go out of my way to come again.
lets face it its a wendys  you know what the menu is and what to expect  really all you can review is the service which is pretty bad here    my order has been consistently wrong here  when i get a salad or a sandwich with lettuce the lettuce is not fresh  the service is rather poor  specifically it takes noticeably longer to get food at this location and often the staff arent making sure they are making food to order    additionally and this may seem like a strange note the line rails leading up to order in the restaurant are not set like every other wendys  it doesnt use the space well and its not clear where to stand   my office very close to this location yet i go out of my way to the wendys at  boyer street instead  they have much better service.
having grown up in north carolina ive had lots of barbecue and i also smoke my own  i feel i can adequately judge the quality of bbq  this particular establishment was unique in that its right off the side of a highway and has drivein microphones and ordering stations straight out of the s  i did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town but not a big deal  i ordered the  barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries  in addition i ordered a minced barbecue sandwich which is the classic barbecue that people would think of when talking about north carolina style bbq     first let me say that foodnetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the s style drivein and for the unique way that the pieces of barbecue chicken are prepared  they are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce  i will say that it is uniqu.
ditto the other ratings for uverse customer service at least once you get past the fabulous sales people my install was scheduled for between  am on a saturday dude called at  to say he was the outside guy and was on his way was indignant when i asked about the earlier time frame actually i laughed when i answered the phone and found out who he was hrs late but i let him come and do at least the outside work called the number on my scheduled appt email at  got a woman who knew nothing about my issues tried to transfer me to dispatch transfer failed she called me back i asked for a supervisor and was on hold for  minutes she called back again tried to transfer me to somebody else said there was a problem with my order but she couldnt tell me what it was after another  minutes on hold i hung up she called back once more told me she would call me as soon as the department was available  never heard back unbelievable not thrilled with time warner or most of their contracted installrepair folks but at least when they are going to be late or have to reschedule they call dont do it.
i made an appointment because i had an terrible stabbing ear ache after waiting nearly an hour after my appointment time i was quickly ushered into a tiny room and without being asked anything i was given a hearing test i never asked for it and dont know why it was done then after another long waiting period the doctor finally saw me and he tells me i have hearing loss he looks into my aching ear and bluntly tells me i have no infection but rather tmj which really really scared me i think he was wrong because two days later i had infected bumps on the side of my face and after it cleared no more pain the entire visit was a horrible waste of time which didnt help me at all and took nearly three hours.
be prepared to wait we were told to be here at  for an  appointment coming up on an hour wait ugh after waiting over an hour to see the doctor and to only talk to him for  minutes was very disappointing  the appointment was for my mother who was previously told she could undergo a specific eye surgery and then upon arriving and preop review she was not qualified not only was the experience in this office disappointing it was a disappointing day for my mother after expectations were expected.
decent mcdonalds definitely better than the one in houston that i used to go to and wrote a complaint on them for being consistently negligent i like this one and its a keeper   place  two stories and for the most part clean  price  its mickey ds   service  somewhat quick in the drivethru friendly people they only forgot once but its forgivable.
rude rude rude i normally never leave a review of a fast food chain but this is an exception  the workers are just plain rude  the fries were nasty and the bun on my burger was stale  avoid this place unless you just dont give a crap about how your treated and want a sub par big mac.
i have visited harpers a few times in the past two years the restaurant is clean and inviting the atmosphere is warm and personable which is nice for couples and families  but with each experience i am less impressed the food is good however there are better places to dine within the southpark area the food is moderately priced but is too much for what you get my last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu the offerings are scarce for a restaurant with a nonspecific specialty im not big on chain restaurants but i would have been happier visiting the cheesecake factory located across the street from harpers which has many more menu options  i am sad to say that i will not visit again unless an executive group decision is made to dine here   .
went to harpers this past tuesday it had been at least  months or more since i had  had the bettys pimento cheeseburger sat in the bar area with one of the new interactive tables that was so cool seems like the menu is much smaller than is used to be but i did finally find my beloved burger and ordered it with fries i told the waitress to please make sure the fries were hot because the last time i was there they had been cold and i really wanted to enjoy this visit when i received the burger it looked different smaller and somehow sadder i could actually fit this burger into my mouth that used to be impossible because it was huge and i would have to eat it with a knife and fork the flavor was bland and instead of the cheese running down my fingers i could barely taste it and the meat was just bland i was so sad  so in short the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down i guess i will have to find a new fav burger jointbooooooo.
harpers is good when you just want to have a prime rib steak kind of night with baked potato or sweet potato fries   i came by here on a thursday night and they hosted a trivia night it was fun sadly with my new work schedule i have not had an opportunity to come back on any thursdays.
red alert red alert   if you are looking for good mobile phone customer service this is not the store im changing my provider to verizon or att after the experience i had last night heres how it went down  i headed in around pm as my contract expired so i needed to upgrade my phone and sign on for two more years when i entered i noticed around eight employees out front and three in the backso i thought to myself this wont take long there are a ton of people working i signed in with the receptionist who told me the wait to buy a new phone would be  minutes no biggie i told her ill just go check out all the gadgets   forty minutes later i was still waiting  and showing as third on the list for service now this wouldnt be a big deal if i wasnt watching the employees talk to each other and head into the back for long periods of time while customers were waiting out front i literally timed two people between customers  one waited over  minutes before helping someone else and the second employee wasnt helping anyone when i left and it had been  minutes since his last customer   needless to say i left the storebut not before telling them to take me off the list so the poor people in line after me didnt have to wait even longer i will not be back and have been researching other providers today.
great little holeinthewall type place sandwiches are wonderful especially the carolina turkey club.
what a fun place to get ideas for your house they have over  booths from different vendors selling everything from jewelry to furniture we spent a few hours here and bought a few unique treats.
yeah this place is horrible ive been here for just under  years and i wish i was able to have moved out before i renewed my lease the previous staff was alright at least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no sense of urgency or how to run a business because the rent payment process is for the most part automated there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up with that being said the model and the common area are far more upgraded and modern than the apartments them selves the apts have  year old appliances and we were told well if they work then they are working by design and we cant replace them but did i mention that they raised the rent after the st year for what no property improvements have been made the same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true waste and pet waste all over stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen   the pool is never clean the hot tub doesnt work you can see the grossness in the water floating on top there are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go the resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out the place is crawling with bugs my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where the walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas bandaid approach to fixing things every month it is a new issue they do not send out notices when complex wide issuesfixes will be happening it really just is a crap place to live better options for  a month and crappy service.
after reading such rave reviews about this place i figured i had to check it out the service here is fantastic i was quickly greeted and seated my server was also very knowledgeable about the menu i ordered the vegetarian tostada and the spinach and cheese quesadilla both were delicious the prices are very reasonable i recommend this place if your looking for good inexpensive comfort food.
ive heard this restaurant from listening to npr in charlotte so i went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out here are my reviews  venue  the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in japan if you have a large group of people your group will be sitting as if youre sitting on a floor but your not the sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open its a comfortable sitting arrangement  sushi  the unagi eel was cooked perfectly the softcrab shells are not bad but i had better ones before  the rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy they need better selections in sushi  presentation  the restaurant lacks in presentation  it was a very simple dish put together    sake  they are pricey  minimum   ramen  the soup was very tasty    overall  if you are craving for ramen this is the best place so far ive tasted as for sushi i would only come here once ive had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in california before  i still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in california also if you dont tip enough you will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip its a mandatory  it feels like a teacher is about to scold you.
husband was craving chicken teriyaki  gyoza so we found musashi i was very unimpressed we started with gyoza and edamame neither were anything special we then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls the chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce was not good at all the sushi was mediocre at best while they were friendly and the service was pretty good  i will not be back.
dont move here this place is horrible the only thing it has going for it is that it looks pretty there is something always wrong with the apartment i would not ever recommend this place to anyone.
the worst apartment ive ever lived in ive only been here  months and im miserable if you are thinking of renting here dont the apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us  times in  months they have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent if you are considering living here i highly encourage you to look elsewhere.
while there were no insect carcasses in my food i was still not very impressed with my meal at pf changs  i went for a business lunch with my boss  who thought i would ever enjoy working more than eatingi think this meal was a first  i got steamed veggies and brown rice  now i expected it to be pretty bland since it mentioned no sauces added at all  but the vegetables were rubbery not crisp like they should be after a good steaming the rice was pretty underdone as well so allinall they got nothing right  i tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit but it was too little too late  perhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup  i usually add pepper to mine because i like the extra kick but this needed much more help than a little pepper  it was very bland and didnt taste like anything  tasteless egg in water is definitely not something you want to keep eating  and of course there was no salt and pepper on the table so i couldnt even enjoy it the way i like   because i didnt pay i didnt complain to the waiter but normally this would not have passed by me  though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable i still would not return here if given the choice.
gross what happened it has been a while since i have been to pf changs it used to be one of my favoritesi remember going to a conference and i ate at the pf changs across the street from my hotel every day   this last time there was pure disappointment from the quality of the food to the service to the taste it was as if i was at some cheap fast food joint each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base it was way too salty since when did they start rationing out their rice we got a very tiny portion of rice and we had to keep asking for more to soak up the salty sauce on the dish blah the service was super slow to greet us at the table and to bring us what we needed made for a very unenjoyable experience   blahand im sad that it wasnt better.
an associate of mine brought me lunch togo and it was delicious we tried the spicy chicken that was very flavorful and not burning your lips off i tried their lo mein which was delicious with varitey of meats finally i had the beef and broccoli with had a ginger orange sauce very tasty the beef was well cooked and medium not tough just all around delicious.
this is my new favorite ht its almost always crowded but its worth it  the selection is better than most hts and the prices are even better how the price can be different one ht  miles away from another ht is beyond me but ive definitely noticed   other differences are that this location seems to be better lit than some of the others and everything looks bright and clean who doesnt love shiny  the ht in matthews has a better local produce selection but higher prices on everything else  you cant win them all i suppose.
eh went here on christmas for dinner had to first seating at  order the special the prime rib  minutes later oh we just sold out of that great ordered the filet and it was just ok wine was outrageously overpriced amazing this place gets such great reviews oh and im og palm one goer the lobbies would have been a better call.
yes it is a chain but some chains are good  the only reason i didnt give the palm five stars is because you need a  oz steak  us chicks cant handle  ounces    i love the fillet  i get it with the oscar option and i cant talk or think about anything else while i am eating it  perfectly cooked i like mediumrare perfectly seasoned slightly salty perfectly served in a little bit of au jus  i had happy dreams for dayssigh    the app we got was the baconwrapped scallops  perfectly cooked and served on a bed of spinach  just fantastic  i love the old school bread sticks in the wrapper  such a perfect way to shovel the palm butter into my piehole    service is excellent  fast and knowledgeable about every dish and historic artifact about the palm  love it  this location valets which i recommend because you will need someone to roll you out after you have eaten every last drop  cant wait for the next special occasion   d.
ive only been here x and both times had a pedicure and gel manicure the first time was okay but the nail tech was rather snotty and had attitude the entire time please if you are offering discount for customers paying in cash you have no reason to be a snot give me a break the nd time i had the same snotty tech and she was just as expectedsnotty the pedicure was a joke and they basically do a quick rub and no true callus removal at all the dryers they use for the gel manicure are old and trashy and have a handmade taped cardboard piece in the middle of it to help you place your hands correctly so that the gel actually adheres well guess what it didnt work and my thumbs were actually chipping the next day when a gel manicure should last  weeks it wasnt worth dealing with them to go back and have it fixed so instead ill just let everyone know not to go there and instead go elsewhere.
i went to oph for dinner and decided on the eggs bacon and pancakes the pancakes and bacon were pretty good the eggs i ordered scrambled and they were too dry for me two things stood out to me about the service i was drinking coffee and the waitress asked if i wanted my coffee topped off with decaf  i wasnt drinking decaf also when i asked for more pancake syrup she brought me the almost empty used syrup from the neighboring table yuck.
we went on a saturday morning and had to wait almost an hour to be seated  my egg white omelette was runny so i sent it back  we are now an hour and twenty minutes into our dining experience and i still have no food that is edible  when the omelette returned they had done something to the eggs to make them ultrafluffy which sounds like it would be good but it wasnt  it was literally like eating a kitchen sponge  my son and husband got pancakes and said that the ones we make at home are better  oh i should add that we went to the one by the target near uptown.
i do not get it  why does this place get voted best breakfast  we had been once before and the pancakes tasted funky and the eggs tasted fishy  tried again today and were again sorely disappointed  after struggling to piece together a breakfast and being told we couldnt do certain things because the computer wont let us we again got a subpar breakfast  so if you want to wakey wakey eggs  bacy avoid this place  you will only get eggo waffles and funky tasting food.
the portions are huge and the wait time is rather long  its always an annoying comfort when you have to wait a hour to get seated  it means youve chosen the right place to eat and that seemingly everyone else in the city has chosen the same place  the food isnt exactly unique but the price is definitely a steal  my western omelette lasted me  consecutive meals  their hash brown mash must have an addictive additive mixed in with its goodness because i cant seem to stop scooping those potatoes into my mouth  go my fellow charlotteans  itll be worth the wait and kind to your wallets.
my family and i have gone to this location several times and the wait has never been too long and the food has always been doggy bag worthy.
everything was sold out when i needed to be in charlotte and so i tried this location mainly because it was available for my dates i was worried that it wouldnt be nice but i was pleasantly surprised   the room was clean well decorated and had a bedroom and separate living room with its own tv it also had a small well equipped  kitchen i didnt use it but it had pots pans  burners a full size refrigerator and sinks etc   they didnt have a yucky comforter but a nice duvet too and plenty of pillows which i insist on   they had a good desk with free internet and the comminity areas were nice inside they had breakfast which i was always too late for  ends at am but looked nice and they also have a bar that stays open late in that same spot  outside is a common area with a fire pit and lots of seating  they have a little store with most essentials in the lobby  hours too i had a terrible dr pepper craving at like midnight and was able to get one downstairs thank goodness i also grabbed coffee in the morning only to have my boss tell me we were going to starbucks and i accidentally said right in front of the desk clerk    oh then i wont drink this crappy coffee    i felt so bad as soon as i said it i am sure it is not crappy   i would stay here again it was comfortable and affordable the parking is kinda weird but over all i was very impressed.
awesome church full of the spirit of god.
upstream is tres chic ive been there multiple times and service has always been impeccable what else would you expect from an establishment that has linen tablecloths   my favorite times to go to upstream has been for brunch and thanksgiving  their brunch is a tad on the high side  i believe but completely worth it just for a bite of the brioche french toast alone  along with that ive gone there for thanksgiving dinner twice and was nothing but pleased with it they have a complete traditional thanksgiving spread set up in their bar along with sushi cooked seafood and other goodies    at the risk of sounding like george costanza they have one of the nicest restrooms ive seen in charlotte they also have a cute patio area with cushioned seats thats perfect to enjoy an after work cocktail on and watch the people of phillips place and dare i say even though its in the heart of south parknot an obnoxious number of misbehaved children  to top it all off they are a part of harpers restaurant group and offer cooking classes on saturdays for class a few of the classes go for  or .
glad we tried this at restaurant week prices  didnt realize it was  a corporate place until we got our leftovers in  a bag advertising the network of places it was part of  we had just said the food was decent but soulless like youd expect of a corporate restaurant when that bag arrived to our oh that explains it typical south side snob crap  high prices and low quality and originality  for people who want to be seen and spend alot and have the palettes of a  year old  for more of the same you can buy  olive oil thats really canola at  dean and deluca next door   like the reviewer here  with one unsalted and one over salted selection i will add that the duck was under cooked and the salmon over cooked disappointing.
phew where to start with this place   this review is from a  time dinner experience on a saturday   the ambience is excellent  comfortable seating spacious and beautifully decorated  fun crowd that is business casual   our service was excellent  really personable made some solid recommendations and just really pleasant    the food was incredible  let me spare your time and tell you that if you a very fresh tasting seafood dish whether it be sushi or oystersgo here  presentation is great portion size is nice flavors outstanding    overall one of my best meals ever.
more like downstream in town from ca and wanted to try something new bad decision bad service food was bland  ill prepared what a disappointment.
i really wanted to love upstream but it totally fell flat we sat in the bar for some apps and drinks after a movie and it was one disappointment after the next the biggest disappointment of all was the management and this is speaking from two people who worked and lived off of tips in the service industry for years we werent looking for anything but an acknowledgment and somehow felt like we were the ones causing problemsso what happened  we ordered shrimp dumplings and they came out raw we sent them back and somehow were left to feel like we were being unreasonable call me crazy but expect food to be cooked and want to make sure there are no risks to eating said food new ones came out they were great but totally different than first ones of which the management said were slightly undercooked and he was trained that most food was sushi grade call me crazy again but just admit the mistake and we all feel good   lastly the bill came and upstream has the audacity to charge  an oyster for wellfleets dozen whaaaat im a boston gal who knows her seafood never in my life have i seen someone charge that amount nevermind that the menu says they are  but they all of a sudden claimed it was a premium oyster at a different price  i can forgive mishaps and mistakes  it happens to the best of us i cannot accept management who is so cavalier and dismissing to their guests  prices are high here and that is no issue for me for great food and service however not acceptable if you cant deliver on those fronts.
recently joined the ymca and this is my home ymca  i love the equipment and most of the staff  i have hit the gym been a member about  days at very varied times but have settled on  am for strength training monwedfri and pm ish for cardio tuesthurssat  at either time it isnt overwhelmingly crowded  i will say at  am and i assume other times there are plenty of meat heads in the weight room  grunting slamming weights flexing in the mirror  i also  find it entertaining to see the fashion show that occurs in the weight room i like to ppl watch between sets   i have never seen so many coordinated work clothes in my entire life  matching shows pantsshortsshirts and often times hats  none of this bothers me it is just entertaining  i have not met anyone very friendly there and i assume that is because it is the sopark area  but since i dont go to the gym to socialize i guess it doesnt matter.
beef kabob gets an easy five stars  persian hot tea five stars the eggplant dish was very good the belly dancing gets five stars  service also gets five stars  from there everything else was good though none of it was better than three stars and not as flavorful as i hoped still good  im the only dude here  eleven female patrons including my bride add two belly dancers and our waitress im out numbered  to     great show  if you have never seen live belly dancing it is usually entertaining and though maybe initially awkward it is fun  persian ice cream nice flavor combination of pistachio rose water and saffron less dense than kulfi  if i had never eaten indian kulfi i would have probably rated this ice cream higher  baklava a bit disappointing papery filo though drier than the overly syrupy version.
a very ratchet place with a very ratchet staff.
the little hippie food market that could seems so out of place in the corridor of crap that is independence boulevard but i gotta tell ya this store is amazing for just about any special dietary need  the star of this market is the aislelong bulk foods section that puts anything at our other local grocery stores to shame  whether you need dried fruits spices or nuts or grains even candies im pretty sure they have it here and also have it as an organic option  you get as much as you need and then write the code on the side of the bag to be weighed at the checkout  they also have just about every homeopathic remedy you could need too  again you can get herbs by bulk or just about any nutrientsupplement your heart desires  big selection of incense and candles too  if you have gluten allergies this ought to be your goto they have a bigger selection than i have seen just about anywhere else  also vegetarianvegan friends will find a healthy supply and selection of different options here too  they have a fresh produce section that is small but can do in a pinch same goes for fresh meats and frozen foods  id still look elsewhere for regular shopping for these items however  i have to deduct a start here because the store does get a little crowdedfeeling and just has the appearance of being somewhat rundown like most of its neighboring businesses which is far below the standard at any of the other speciality grocers in town  still the store is never loaded with people and the staff is most helpful if approached  i still dont know why they put this store where it is but im not going to complain because im glad its there.
we took my wifes sorento into for service on her ac for the first time in march they told us it was her compressor and they replaced it luckily we had a extended warranty and they covered most of it that didnt work so we took it back they said it was a bad control unit and wanted  to replace it i found it online for just over  and i replaced it myself that didnt fix it so we took it back again they said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it they charged us for the replacement but didnt replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit they ordered a warranty replacement and i picked it up much to their disappointment and put it in myself that didnt work either and after spending over  and wasting two plus months with them we took it to dale jarrett kia in monroe they determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time they were able to get kia to warranty two new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out they had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem folger kia has got to be the worse dealership in the charlotte area we spoke directly with kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible folger kia was and how badly they treated us my wife went in when we were finished dealing with folger to get a receipt to give to dale jarrett and mike melton treated her horribly i will never use or recommend folger kia to anyone they are dishonest and their customer service is terrible if you have to use a kia dealer go to dale jarrett it isnt that far but your experience will be so much better.
and this chithole is still open  why  must be so the gangbangers have a place to conduct target practice.
