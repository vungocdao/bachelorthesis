Review_new
contrary to other reviews i have zero complaints about the service or the prices i have been getting tire service here for the past  years now and compared to my experience with places like pep boys these guys are experienced and know what theyre doing  also this is one place that i do not feel like i am being taken advantage of just because of my gender other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars and have sucked my bank account dry but here my service and road coverage has all been well explained  and let up to me to decide  and they just renovated the waiting room it looks a lot better than it did in previous years.
last summer i had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time i also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on they fixed it for free and the very next morning i had the same issue i called to complain and the manager didnt even apologize so frustrated never going back  they seem overpriced too.
friendly staff same starbucks fair you get anywhere else  sometimes the lines can get long.
the food is good unfortunately the service is very hit or miss the main issue seems to be with the kitchen the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and its pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints.
even when we didnt have a car filenes basement was worth the bus trip to the waterfront i always find something usually i find  things and spend about  and better still i am always still wearing the clothes and shoes  months later   i kind of suspect this is the best shopping in pittsburg.

mediocre service cold food our food waited so long the lettuce  pickles wilted bland food crazy overpriced long waits in the arcade  beer per hour maximum  avoid at all costs fair manager.
ok let me tell you about my bad experience first i went to db last night for a post wedding party  which side note is a great idea  it was around midnight and the bar wasnt really populated there were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything the two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at kind of counter productive if you ask me   i stood there for about  minutes which for a busy bar is fine but when i am the only one with my card out then it just seems a little ridiculous i made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away i finally had to walk to them to get their attention  i was standing right in front of them smiling and they didnt ask if i need anything i finally said are you working and they gave each other a weird look i felt like i was the crazy one i asked for a beergot the beer  in between that time the other bartender brought food over and set it down she took a fry from the plate right in front of me and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar what the hell i felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks  not an established db   i was just really turned off from that experience   the good is that db provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up i remember going here with my grandparents when i was a kid and it was the best treat ever we would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games this place holds some really good memories for me   its a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards i held for it.
i used to love db when it first opened in the waterfront but it has gone down hill over the years the games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality it takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil the atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people now it is run down and many of the games are app related games fruit ninja and d experience rides with such games you cant even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens last time i went back in the winter many of the games were broken which made for a negative player experience i would go to db to play some games again in the future but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.
like any barnes  noble it has a nice comfy cafe and a large selection of books  the staff is very friendly and helpful  they stock a decent selection and the prices are pretty reasonable  obviously its hard for them to compete with amazon  however since all the small shop bookstores are gone its nice to walk into one every once in a while.
meh ive experienced better is an understatement  fridays is like the fine dining chain for every yinzer in pittsburgh    when we were seated it was quick which was a surprise  somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why  i was happy about that   i ordered one of their skinny margaritas blackberry to be exact  it was a nice size however at pop that was half of my food bill   the waitress started off attentive but after our food came out she was gone  i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard  loaded mashed potato on the side because i wanted heartburn ha   food came  my burger had lettuce on it only  waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks  i had to wait to ask for my pickle   the loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what i was expecting  disappointment   the waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check    never again will i eat at fridays  i will however go should a happy hour arise.
unos has been around for ever  i feel like this restaurant chain peak in popularity in the s honestly the decor inside still kind of looks s to me even though its nice with sleek booth and exposed brick  if you havent died and he recently i ordered you to come back and have a meal here again because honestly the food is really quite good  they have the best chicken salad wrap ever i love that rap so much i want agreed to walk the south side river trail from where the steelers practice all the way to the damn waterfront just because i knew that i could convince my boyfriend to go to unos with me for lunch  full disclosure  i made him call is a cab and we took a taxi back to the parking lot after lunch  listen the food and pizza and service are very good surprisingly so i dont know why this place is not busier but next time youre down at the waterfront please do consider dining here.
stars are for the food only     rating  got there at pm on saturday night they told us it was an hour wait which was expected but it only took minutes to be seated so that was a bonus  started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me nowfyilove the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory  i had the singapore rice noodles  this was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better  the fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw   some good notes were the dynamite shrimp plump juicy tangy with a small kick    sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick   the service was annoying   we were there less than  minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there   constantly asking if he could remove my plate  i had to sternly say at one point that i will let you know when i am finished  i found it rude especially since  there wasnt even a line at this point    i think we will travel elsewhere following a movie  the result never quite met the anticipation.
our last few visits have left something to desire one of the things i always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees these people look miserable no one smiles or greets you appropriately its more like get in get out turn the tables  the food has remained consistently good when we can order it the last time jb and i came for a quick dinner the place was not busy yet we were passed by  frowning waitstaff without getting drinks for  minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table hint hint so we left and most likely will not be returning.
good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef  bar service was fast and efficent   good value  not a  cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat   fortune was even postive.
very bad purchase experience i bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves but they denied my request to return it i am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore.
when i think bbb i think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tuneup and a few fixes are long gone      this review is more for the repair end of bbb in their defense bbb does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike ie colnago that you just dont find anywhere else in pittsburgh   at bbb i was charged  for a tune up and a few other things granted this included installing a sew up tire which i can understand would cost approx  swapping out a left side big ring shifter on my down tube this should have cost approx  at most and installing new bar tape cost of tape  and  to install so whats with  for a tune up well the story goes like this  i bring the bike into bbb prior to the nice weather hitting pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my oclv trek  ready for the season turns out i dont hear from these guys a week goes by two weeksi think thats ok i have two or three other bike i can turn to for a ride then i wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure ill get a call from them re my bike is ready to rollbut no dice so i call turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was reinstalling the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out is that my fault he says should be ready in a few days so i come in a few days later to this mammoth bill i ask if i am paying for the labor of taping out the screw i dont think i ever got a straight answer i look at the bill and cant see a good breakdown of the charges normally i would duke it over a bill like this but i figuredi had somewhere i to be  minutes ago and at least i finally have my bike i would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over overhauled but it wasnt  well bbb ill give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great nice wrap plus ill toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles maybe i would have rated bbb higher if i was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair.
my orders have come out bad pretty much every time i have ordered from here the chicken nuggets come out under par im lucky if the fries come out right my last experience is the last straw i recently posted a photo of my chicken ranch club that has no chicken this is ridiculous i am done going to this mcds.
wow what a shame my family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine we are a very large family and love foods of all kind weve eaten chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities hands down this was the worst weve ever had cold tough congealed and tasteless  thats the only way to describe it ill never order from here again quite frankly the fact that i took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was my complaints fell on deaf ears i guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food i understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food it happens but when it does you bend over backwards to make it right not at this place i was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me i guess thats how they deflect complaints  blame it on the owners that arent there and make the customer for away angry  too bad because we will be visiting a competitor in the future this family of  wont be visiting china sea ever again oh and by the way why cant i give this place zero stars.
i fell in love with this place as soon as we pulled up and saw the lights strung up and  oldies coming from the speakers   i tried the banana cream pie hard ice cream their scoops are very generous   my bf got the peach cobbler hard ice cream and that was to die for we got  servings of ice cream for  which nowadays is a steal imo    ill definitely be heading back with my coworkers this week.
this is by far the best soft serve ice cream place in southwestern pa the flavor of the week is always interestingand tasty though i am somewhat disappointed that theyve switched to a lower grade ice milk for their vanilla and chocolate offerings i dont know if this is a matter of cutting corners or if the better stuff simply isnt available any longer either way this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of dq tastee freeze etc its definitely worth the trip its mostly street parking though they do have about  parking spaces off to the side serving sizes are huge the small cone here is the same size as a dq large and the large is so big they cant fit it through the windowthey hand it out the side door  if you want a real kodak momentorder a large cone for the kids and keep the camera and wet wipes handy.
this is my goto distributer they have a great selection and lots of hard to find brews i havent noticed that its any more expensive than going elsewhere but honestly if i dont buy here then im buying six packs which as we all know are a huuugggge rip off so any time i have a case of something i love i feel like im getting a bargain the cold selection does suck so i try to plan ahead and have what i need already cold staff here are all very helpful and will have recommendations if you ask.
love this beer distributor  they always have what im looking for the workers are extremely nice and always willing to help best one ive seen by far.
went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition   we were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal   our waitress was good but that couldnt save the food  the meal started out with some what i guess used to be foccacia  i say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless  we ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces   then we ordered the octopus which was fine but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish   the tuscan wings were ok but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them   finally the diver scallops  this dish was indeible  the scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty i was unable to eat it we sent it back and they did take off half of the price werent expecting anything just didnt want to eat it   after that we decided against dessert and left  i probably will not return.
i went there today the cut was terrible i have an awful experience they lady that cut my hair was nice but she wanted to leave early so she made a disaster in my head.
as a chinese american college student from nyc who got stuck in pittsburgh with its useless public transportation circa  i desperately missed homestyle chinese food for the better part of my first two years here things turned around for me once i got a car or made friends with cars but i was seriously hurting for a while  tasty was one of the places we found back in the day it was owned and ran by a typical restaurantowning chinese family they had the works  pushy lao ban niang boss lady chef slash dad and during school offhours junior high school daughter manning the cashier if they were in nyc theyd only be missing an ami a bus boy the food was pretty good and if you order in chinese the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because your parents teach you good to talk chineees   im pretty sure tasty is under new ownership now the food isnt as good as it was but the restaurant still gives off the homestyle look and feel its a small restaurant with enough seating for about  patrons cheap tables cheap seat.
this shelter is fantastic and has generally very good friendly people on staff  the cats and dogs appear to be treated at least as well as one might expect  when i adopted one of my cats at this establishment i had to return the next day to have her spayed  they did it for free which was great but the reason they dont get five stars is that the desk clerk completely forgot about my cat and me and she left us waiting as she chatted on her cell phone with a friend she only remembered about us as she was walking out for a smoke and saw us sitting in the lobby.
our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address he was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep we went to the arl and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia she said in the most uncaring apathetic voice possible we were heartbroken of course go wait by that door and someone will meet you after a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier ill bring your carrier back out in a minute we said no thats okay keep the carrier she said okay and took our cat to the back and that was it no kind words no sympathetic gestures no would you like a moment before i take him no im sorry nothing for us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the arl seemed to care or at least have been trained to pretend to care one bit   they get a couple stars for offering a necessary service but other than that this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy.
yes awesome soy cap scone and atmosphere nice place to hang out  read and free wifi with no login procedure.
the people who work here are very rude i have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person but no it happen every time i am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there it is like you are walking into someones house and bothering them the people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation plus it is very dirty perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other i will not go back again.
ive been here quite a few times and i always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near pitt they have a ton of nice hdtvs  everytime i go there is always a weird taste to one or more of the beers that i get i was just there for the pittoakland game and got a redhook i drink this beer regularly and something was wrong with the beer its definitely hard to describe but something is always off others in my party notice it too  the food is hit or miss i got the french onion soup last time it was good nothing ground breaking but solid soup ive had the pork nachos and they were blah.
the location is convenient but i was not a fan of the food i had shrimp and chinese veggies and crab rangoon they cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland i wont go back for food but the crab rangoon was ok they didnt give any sauce you have to ask for it that sucks.
i cannot sing tim walters praises loud enough  i have taken my car to him for about  years and i always leave with a new experience attesting to his awesomeness if you think you might have something wrong with your car that youre not sure what it is you can just stop by and hell usually take a break from what hes working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion then when he diagnoses your car hell explain it to you like youre not an idiot and hell make sure you understand whats going on hes incredibly honest and cares about his customers for instance once i had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didnt have it in stock he told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it the price difference was like ten bucks so i had him do it because it wasnt an emergency and id rather give him my business hes awesome.
the first time i came here i waited in line for  minutes  when it was my turn i realized i left my wallet in the car  it hurt so bad i didnt come back for a year  i can walk to this place from my house which is dangerous because those biscuits are just oh so dreamy  i cant describe them  just get some  do i feel guilty about noshing on fabulous strawberry napoleons and jewish pizza kind of like a modified yet totally delicious fruitcake bar at am  hecks naw but they do have quiche and some other breakfasty items for those who prefer a more traditional approach to your stomachs opening ceremony  just go early   they open at  on saturdays  and bring cashits easier that way.
im a creature of habitive been getting a savory and sweet item each time im around the neighborhood white lily cake is divine quiches always tasty macarons are alittle too sweet i wish the cake slices werent pop otherwise would be a regular here.
i dont know maybe im not clear on the concept of whole foods  dont get me wrong theres nothing really wrong with shopping at whole foods  whole foods does have wonderful merchandise but  i have found that i can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at giant eagle for less  thier wine and beer selection supposedly quite remarkable in other states well remember this is pennsylvania  you cant buy those things at the grocery store    i can get just as good quality meat and produce in the strip district  sometimes even better quality  i guess the benefit of whole foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and dont have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores  im not slamming whole foods at all but i actually like trader joes better.
we decided to give brunch a try for our first visit to casbah  we were surprised  by the huge tent covering the outdoor dining area  we opted for an inside table the interior is somewhat small the tables are close together  for brunch you are served your choice of drink appetizer and entree    for our drinks bj had a bloody mary and i had a bellini  we were served a basket of yummie bread and mini muffins  for appetizers we got a three sisters farms mesclun greens and smoked salmon and truffled potato cake  very good  for entrees we selected a jumbo lump crab  tomato omelet and the ny strip steak  very relaxing and tasty meal.
when scoping around online for a good nye dinner destination for my husband and me casbahs prix fixe menu really jumped off the page since the big burrito group is so popular i was happy to get reservations especially since a lot of times were already booked  the hubby and i arrived a few minutes early for dinner i had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that big burrito restaurants have free valet parking  so great especially with slushy snow on the ground even though we were a few minutes early the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately    service was extremely attentive from start to finish waters were refilled quickly bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first the bread came with a delicious spread  was it goat cheese  that i just couldnt stop eating silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced  we ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire nye prix fixe menu none of the eight dishes disappointed the first courses were sea scallops  octopus and duck confit the sea scallop was perfectly cooked the octopus  thought not my cup of tea  was also well cooked and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty i absolutely loved the duck confit dish it was served with mustard greens and fruit with a todiefor dressing  a delicious combination  the second courses were potato gnocchi and mushroom tortelloni the gnocchi was served with lobster which was a unique but nice paring though a strongly flavored dish the tortelloni was delicious and i enjoyed another unique paring tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib  lake ontario walleye and roasted veal strip loin were the third courses both were cooked to perfection the walleyes skin was perfectly crispy and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender however a component of each dish was disappointing  a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal i really cant hold this against casbah though im just not a fan of mustard  finally the desserts was fantastic the chocolate ganache tart was the ending of the sea courses the chocolate was strong even a little bitter and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote i grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish a caramel macaroon completed the land courses the macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce  our experience at casbah was spectacular based on this experience i debated giving the restaurant five stars but decided to wait until i returned a second time and i cant wait to return.
overpriced salty and overrated why this place is so popular i will never understand.
every time i have been to casbah for lunch brunch or dinner the food has been great and the service has been impeccable  sure ive had more exceptionally delicious and unique meals in pittsburgh but casbah has consistent awesomeness down pat  just get a reservation ahead of time  also the desserts are mandatory    the duck confit gnocchi is smashing its a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savoryand my favorite is probably the casbah doublecut pork chop superyum comfort food  the short rib ravioli is some potroasty goodness and the long island duck is another great choice    a nice surprise here are the great happy hour specials at the bar  try the boyd  blair cocktail and the sangria.
my girlfriend and i went to casbah for the first time recently and we both enjoyed our experience  the atmosphere is dressy but the restaurant isnt so formal that it feels stuffy or uncomfortable which is a welcome change compared to most classy restaurants  the environment was relaxed and it was easy to have a quiet conversation throughout the meal  as for the meal itself we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up  our waiter was courteous and provided good fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering which was quite nice  for an appetizer we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique  following the cheese tray i dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia  both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious  id recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good out of the ordinary food.
i am not a vegan and went there to meet friends and enjoy the atmosphere i must say the hipster tude of the place was intimidating at first but its super friendly and retrofeeling  servers were fairly friendly  we had some great lattes and chai teas and chatted for a long time without being bothered  didnt try the food but there were lots of vegeterian and vegan options.
this valentines day i ordered a pizza for my boyfriend and asked that they make a heart on it out of green peppers the pizza was great the heart was perfect and he loved it.
it seems like every other time i take my pets to point breeze there is an unnecessary frustration   from being berating for using their online prescription program to being misquoted prices substantially to poor customer service i just keep hoping each time will be better  although i know they love animals i suspect they love money more  dr caroline simard is an excellent vet but my last two visits have been pushed to other vets whose bedside manner is atrocious   im a  yearold  who has been taking my pets to vets since childhood and i dont understand why each visit leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
refused to take my cat which had passed away for cremation cause i had not been to the clinic previously imho thats ridiculous i will not recommended anyone to ever come here.
my partner and i were visiting my family in pittsburgh we live in san diego my partner was born and raised in portugal my mom heard about this resaurant and was excited to take my partner and i to a portuguese restaurant in pittsburgh we went looked at the menu and did not find anything portuguese on the menu why does this restaurant promote itself as portuguese fly the portuguese flag and not have any portuguese dishes we left.
what a gem of a place in shadyside  it s places like this that makes me miss living there  food was outstanding  because it was our first time we wanted to do a little bit of this and that   appetizers becky s salad and the special of the eve  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh a clam dish forgot name with the best tomatoewhite wine i could have drunk from the bowl brot.
and sothe search for a new hair salon continues sigh dont get me wrong the cut was a good cut the salon itself was clean and stylish the owner welcoming and friendly   now what went wrong the cut was good but it certainly wasnt what i expected from a salon with the reputation of izzazu i wasnt bowled over by my stylists professionalism either dont diss my previous stylistshe rockedyou dont do yourself any favors by knocking someone else  and come on i was waaayyyy overdue for a cut since ive been driving to cleveland for a style  that being said for  and saving big bucks on gas tolls lunch and shopping the cut was still a deal but when i started to sign the charge slip it said  not  but i said the website said it was  for a master stylist oh the chick at the counter said thats for mens cuts silly me   so when i got back to the office i went online and checked nope it said  for a master stylist womens haircut hmmmmm so i called the chick at the counter now said oh our stylists charge whatever they feel the cut should be what so i quoted the prices to her from the izzazu website she changed her tune again oh wellill refund you  if you give me your credit card number didnt she have my slip with the card number sorry i dont give my credit card number over the phone or i can send you a gift certificate nope i said through clenched teeth i wont be coming back  it wasnt the cut it was the bait and switch id gladly have paid it had they been up front and aboveboard ahead of time as judge judy says dont pee on my leg and tell me its raining   the search goes on or ill be back in cleveland in the spring for the next cut  p s  one amusing side note  i checked in at izzazu when i arrived  turns out im the duchess  the duchess is displeased.
pages is a pittsburgh icon the ice cream is good the selection is vast and the price is right they have so many different things to try its nearly impossible to choose im a big fan of the cookie sundae brownie sundae and cinnamon roll sundae the options at this place are pretty much endless but sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go its better than dairy queen and you support a local business by going here what more could you ask for   i dont know if i would say that pages has particularly superior soft serve but its the experience and variety that makes this a four star place i do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like dairy queen but not by much what makes pages special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors its also the nostalgia that goes along with it its a business that hasnt changed much in its lifetime and thats what most people like about it you can count on pages to be there every marchoctober theyre going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime  it represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people it means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop   for those who have never been there there is no interior so youll have to eat in your car or standing outside i prefer to open the back of my suv sit there and enjoy the night while i eat my ice cream the parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes i typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason   beware they only accept cash but there is an atm on site.
the first time i went here was with a group  we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party   i had a horrible experience  vowed never to go back  at that time i even had a terrible interaction with the owner  this time i was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it decided to try again since it was more about the get together than the foodlocation  this time overpriced food and bad service  overall it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price   i had the veal speciality   large portion but ok  staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present  i am a pittsburgh native  this is a bad neighborhood   i am not interested in ever going back.
our experience not so great  we have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with dollar in squirrel hill  mortgage application process was brutal  starting with the advertised rate of  being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it i.
i recently bought my first motorcycle a  ktm duke ii and found bohns when searching online for ktm dealers i went in with the intention of buying a jacket helmet and gloves their store is pretty nice inside and they have a good selection of gear mostly dirtoriented though   i wasnt quite sure what i wanted so i asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet she was helpful and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather however a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket which they also sold and she commented that the hated that jacket and that the liner was nothing more than a glorified garbage bag ok  we also talked to a guy at the register about a  ktm  mxc that my friend just bought and asked a simple question about a clutch cable the guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless and im not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was he ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old what  even after that i still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet i liked that they had assured me would be in later that week i then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available but that i could pick another style i then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund  i wanted to like this place but between the thinlyveiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff i dont think ill ever return their prices and selection are pretty decent so if you are in the area and know what you want it might be ok to stop by and pick something up if you have any alternative though i would avoid this place.
fun bar and instead of typical bar food they lean towards greek dishes the blue grass jam on wednesdays is a lot of fun and not too loud to still enjoy a conversation decent beer prices pretty good selection.
first time customer today  it is truly a dive but the sandwiches are great  large portions fresh bread and cheap.
i went to a bob marley laser show as a favor for my husband  the lasers were really cool  i would not recommend them if you are prone to migraines or have a neuro disorder such as seizures i think if the music was more my taste it would have been awesome.
love this place i was visiting pittsburgh from houston and we decided to finish off our visit with this museum  or should i say museums coming from houston where we have some pretty good museums this was a pleasant surprise  really cheap considering you get both art and natural history the dinosaur exhibit was so interesting and educational  the gem and mineral exhibit was huge and the art museum had a surprisingly awesome collection  i was thrilled to see a couple van goghs monets cezannes etc the only exhibit i didnt much care for was the temporary art exhbit  some contemporary craziness that involved body parts dangling from the ceiling at least it gave us something to talk about all in all i did not spend nearly as much time here as i could have and would have liked i highly recommend this for anyone visiting pittsburgh.
been there three times and each time it got better  most recent dinner was with a party of   a large crowd for a smal place but they made it work  everyone was extremely pleased with their meal  the lobster ravioli  salmon specials were top notch  the service was even better than the food if that is possible  best restaurant in the burgh  its byob to boot  make sure you have reservations.
the store reeks of rotting fish the security guards watch you like a hawk and the food selection is the worse ive seen in any giant eagle in the city  one plus if you must shop here there are plenty of jitney drivers waiting for you to come out to offer you a ride  that can be a big help if you are like me and dont have a car need a car haha some things about living in the hood just never change   with this being the closet g e to downtown and pnc park and heinz field i would think they would renovate but its been years and still no change.
i really wasnt thrilled with our meal here the service was fine although a bit slow for a notsobusy wednesday night we started with the breaded zucchini which was about  breading  zucchini the breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable  i had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini still too heavy and altogether flavorless the chicken was cooked perfectly though it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake the pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though my husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera which was strangely enough very spicy though the server did warn us about this beforehand to her credit and again not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly.
seattle may have just won the  super bowl but the steelers still rock with six rings baby just stating what all steeler fans know a steel dynasty is still unmatched no matter what team claims the title of current super bowl champs go steelers.
okay so i tried this place twice before writing a review to give them a fair shot unfortunately the second visit wasnt any better  i will start with the good service is pretty good  the place smells of smoke why because you can smoke in the bar and there is an opening from the bar into the restaurant this has to be a violation of the no smoking in dining areas in pittsburgh gross   the floor carpeted is so old that it is sticky and worn down walking on it with shoes on disgusted me the walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place please remodel at least make me feel like the place is clean if i feel like it is dirty in the dining hall i cant imagine its clean in the kitchen  now for the food i am pretty picky about seafood it needs to be fresh and cooked correctly dont get the salmon or tuna steak tuna and salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly both tasted very fishy to me salmon that tastes overly fishy to me screams this fish is not fresh mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes dont get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes i get it you wanna have a mom and pop shop but to do that you need to have great food  overall i just dont think this place is good and dont want to go back.
review    i got hooked on this bakery while living in brighton heights  now when i drive past i have to stop  i think this one is so much better than the sister store in west view  i dont know wh.
this was my second visit and alas my last   our first visit was at lunch and it was just ok we werent blown away nor were we impressed but i will always opt to support a local mom  pop shop if all things are equal this last visit was the pits  it was pm on a saturday night we were one of two tables this is usually an indication of something fishy excuse the pun appetizer was edamame it was overcooked and left uneaten i am not the adventurous sushi ordere.
bed bugs horrible place do not stay here stayed here for a wedding we attended woke up in the middle of the night with bites all over my legs arms and back we flip a pillow over and there it was bed bugs we had to cut our trip short the man at the front desk apologized and gave us the managers name and number and told us to call back later that morning we have been calling since  and have yet to receive a call back such disrespect we risk bringing back bed bugs and spending hundreds on extermination fees and no has the decency to call back.
i had not been to betos in many many years  boy has the place grown up  still the same pizza that you will either love or hate  the pizza here has the chesse and topings put on after they cook it so it melts some while you eat it  tastes really good    i also has the apetizer sampler which was a lot of food for two people   was not to crowded but full saturday at lunch  highly recommended.
a different style love or hate pizza a square cut thicker crust with cold shredded cheese on top its different enough that it is a good chance of pace to your standard pie.
great shop watched them make their waffle comes right in the shop and they are delish  tried the salted caramel and was surprised to find little chocolate covered caramels inside yum.
i will never forget campitis as a youngster growing up playing on potomac avenue and dormont my favorite pizza was and still is campitis i have not found an equal in the  years i have been in ca the hoagies were pretty damn good too.
agree with chaitiyana this place is pretty bad the food isnt fresh they have a buffet even for dinner i stayed at days inn for wks here and was forced to eat here a few times the mango lassi was good the naans when fresh were good but mostly it all stunk.
got the buffet pizza was good they also give you free soup to .
i had a positive experience with this shop i needed something framed at the last minute and within extremely precise parameters that werent easy to abide by and they not only got the work done correctly and on time but at a reasonable price   the staff is a little gruff but not at all unfriendly and i am happy to have found a local shop that i will return to.
cons  very cramped space aisles are so narrow that you have to carry your case sideways  only a few items were priced with signs hanging above them  no shopping carts  pros  decent selection  chilled section.
i lived in pittsburgh for four years and have never been to ds but i visited recently and went with some friends what lured me was the promise of veggie dogs and burgers and i was not let down i got two hot dogsa chicago and a mac and cheese really really good my boyfriend ordered the red alert dog his was meat and his face basically melted off but he insisted he loved it then he said the spices may or may not have traveled to his tear ducts but to each his own he had a great time my two friends also got the mac and cheese veggie dog and loved it  the beer cave is awesome  id love to give ds five stars but like a couple of people mentioned the service is lacking everyone is friendly but i had to walk around and find our server so i could pay and then find him again when he didnt return it took us a while to get water refills too the dining area and the bar are separated and it seems like the servers congregate in one place and leave the other vacant at any given time very nice people though.
something different here  food schmood go there and drink the beers from the beer cave  i dont think you have to wait for the server to open your beer theyll notice and charge your accordingly  its all walk in and self service beer why dont more places do that  mike.
its got its ups and downs  its got a reasonably attractive interior antique tin ceilings a broad selection of dozens of beers and a tasty looking menu featuring daily specials  so why my low score  ds at the other end of the block puts their beer collection to shame offering  beers  both times ive eaten here the wait to be served has been extremely slow at least  minutes and up the prices are a bit high  for a lunch entree and most importantly the food is in general heavy and bland  this is not a terrible place but with so many delicious spots nearby in regent square like the green mango map room ds and the square cafe you should keep on walking  that said if you wanted a quiet spot to grab a beer with a friend you could definitely do worse but skip the boring food.
food is delicious and staff is very prompt    the one thing i absolutely love about this restaurant is how clean the bathroom is  i was completely stunned and amazed when i walked in.
i got two pairs of shoes fixed here recently and i was very pleased with the work done and the cost  it is a great little business to have in the neighborhood  make sure you call and check their hours saturdays are probably your best bet.
best subs ever  seriously  we saw this on pa nat with dave and dave and it looks awesome  we took the drive to swissvale and got us a battleship and it was literally  feet long just the right amount of veggies and meat and delicious  it was  meals worth of food for two people  even better the next day  and the best part was that it was under  bucks    its great fast food  i cant wait to bring friends there to enjoy their selection of s along with a battleship.
this place is okay the waiter was horrible and barely checked on us the food was also not too good it was very bland and didnt have a lot of taste to it i will not be coming back.
the worst pulled pork sandwich i have ever had    their watermelon mixed drink was very good though  i wont be returning.
being born and raised into an all italian family im pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy tomato sauce for the unknowing my great grandmothers sauce was the first i remember she never opened a can to make her sauces always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars she simmered her sauces until every seed melted away my mothers sauce was a bit more thicker using puree and paste as a base later adding whole peeled tomatoes garlic and fresh basil her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves  sorry on to my review of olive garden seriously really no i will admit its good in a fit of really really needing a pasta fix or if you want to eat breadstick and salad but the sauces are overly rich and i dont mean the tomato sauces i mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken beef or fish and let me be real italian here pasta is never the main meal in an italian supper pasta is normally the first course and never served with meat including meatballs thats as american as fortune cookies after pasta comes the protein that includes meatballs then finally salad  okay im done being a snooty italian who looks down upon olive garden i got out all my frustrations on you my readers but seriously if you want good italian food hit up a really good neighborhood family owned italian restaurant the service is better it will be cheaper and it wont go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta which is one of the cheapest food you can serve oh two stars for a pretty good bowl of pasta fazoo pasta and beans.
great bagels sandwiches soup and coffee my favorites are the vegout bagel sandwich the bagel dog on onion and their sour cream potato salad is so good too if you like all beef hotdogs you should try the bagel dog they wrap bagel around the dog when they heat it up the juice soaks into that chewy bagel and it is heaven  mmm.
there is serious separation anxiety when you have to leave your stylist with whom you have established a bond and maybe even spilled serious personal information to   having moved from the south i had to leave a woman i loved and strike out into all new territory it was the end of a  year relationship and i wasnt prepared to see just any old body after that   then i found nicolette at mcn shes amazing and chill and friendly and interesting and and and shes great at her job also the salon is beautiful and the stylists range in price so if you are occasionally living from paycheck to paycheck like me you can see jenn or kara and get a great cut without having to scrounge through your piggy bank for a little extra  however if you dont like dogs be aware that josie the bulldog is frequently around and about.
i booked a hair apt here after reading some of the reviews on yelp hoping id find a place to get my hair cut after moving to pittsburgh from nj maybe it was just the hairdresser i booked an appointment with but i did not have a great experience im a nurse who works mostly day shifts and i value sleep over styling my hair in the morning i tried to articulate that i wanted a hair cut that required minimal styling on my part the hairdresser immediately shot me down asking me how i expected to have my hair look nice if i wasnt willing to put work into it she then berated me for not using styling products again id rather sleep   now maybe a few people feel differently about their hair but all i wanted was a cut that allowed for minimal styling on my part i wasnt asking for some trendy do that needed  different products a round brush and a flat iron in order to recreate it i ended up getting almost the same exact cut i had going in there just an inch shorter oh and she also told me the cut i had coming in wasnt entirely flattering because of its blunt ends funny i ended up with the same thing   this experience has definitely made me decide never to go back for  i expect a little bit better service and a little bit nicer treatment oh and somewhere that isnt constantly pushing products.
very sloppy no attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now im going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone.
hotel restaurantbars are usually not known for being the best in town  so when i had the opportunity to eat and drink at soho recently i can not say i was surprised that i found the cuisine to be on the uninspiring side  is it terrible  no  but you know that better is out there    the blackened chicken wrap was boring  the flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland  also white tortillas just do not do it for me  why does it seem that pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty flavorless food  upon ordering the caesar salad on new years eve i was told that the restaurant has no non or lowfat dressing optionat all  however i can order a salad with french fries on it  seriously  the salad was fine by the way and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing  on the bright side the smoked turkey wrap which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good  the turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries  that i could eat again and it would  fill me up all day  i also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the mrs ts ones with franks hot sauce on them  they were good but uncreative considering the price   the drinks here are decently priced and pretty good  friends i was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choicesthey were strong drinks  when my coworker and i arrived though one night to dine here we were not offered cocktail menus so i just stuck with wine until i was no longer in the mood for a cocktail    service on new years eve was apathetic  granted the place was packed but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us  even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made  there are a ton of tvs here so it is a great spot to watch a game  even during busy times there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit    i think i would stop back here if i find myself at the springhill suites again but i definitely would not go out of my way to dine here  cant win em all right    protip  you can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to springhill suites without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one  want some good people watching  sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key  ridiculous  since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors this does not make any sense  but it is what it is so do not forget your key.
didnt eat herethis review not about the food  we went on friday night around pm there seemed to be about  occupancy  the hostess asked us if we had a reservation we didnt  and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait  minutes  wtf  we immediately left and frankly its not worth going back again  shame the fish was good there crappy hostess for sure.
i am sorry to have to give the original fish market a  rating i could of given it a  but the service was pretty sad we sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room we waited too long for the waiter to initially great us and there may have only been  diners in the entire restaurant so this is the main reason for a  hopefully its a rarity because the food was pretty good i had the cod sandwich  it was hot and tasty probably one of the better fish sandwiches ive had so it disappoints me to dole out a  but service is important.
very nice cheap quick bus service to airport x  but i think ive found out what happens to all the old buses in seattle they are shipped to pittsburgh old polluting diesel buses seem to be the norm  they also run the inclines which are pretty cool if not old.
port authority formerly known as patransit or pat operates a fairly extensive network of buses and in the south hills light rail instead of running school buses the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class and i have used the bus since   ive had a great experience using the bus in pittsburgh i didnt get a drivers license until i was almost the bus miss patanother nickname and my bike got me everywhere i needed to go there will inevitably be delays and problems but that is common to all modes of transportation the price is right especially with a free bus pas.
the store is small but it carries specialties that are difficult to find in pittsburgh i was particularly excited to find middle eastern chili sauce and chocolate covered turkish delights.
boy do i miss primate bros  i remember going there when the packing district was coming alive at  and  am  we were coming back from a night of being out n about with friends this was in high schoolcollege summers in the mids  we would order wild concoction in sandwiches with french fries in them  i liked the place so much i bought and wore proudly one of their tshirtsbut alasleft it with a native friend she also liked it alot in koh samui thailand.
salami and cheese is so amazing best food in the city.
it wasnt bad but it definitely wasnt good   as soon as we walked in the door the place was jammed back with people who were not interested in seating anyone or telling anyone they would be seated on one side of the restaurant there were literally two girls working and one of them was pregnant you can imagine the chaos i wanted to have this pittsburgh experience that ive heard so much about but honestly i was more than underwhelmed   after being seated it took the waitress  minutes to get around to actually saying hello to us and in between that time a large group of people decided to squeeze in a booth behind our table making my friend having to get up every time a waitress or another person needed to squeeze back there  the sandwich at best was mediocre the coleslaw was a bit too vinegary for my tastes and became sickening after the first half of the sandwich i needed a lot of ketchup to even finish the sandwich not to mention i got a nice souvenier of vinegary smelling hands afterwards   if youre a tourist go do it to say you had a colossal sandwich and lived the pittsburgh experience apart from that i dont know why youd return.
a classic nothing else to say.
clearly should have read a few reviews before going here whenever i go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments i order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits since it was  in the morning i chose not to order primantis   best seller which the waitress told me was beer but perhaps that would have made my experience better as it was i ordered the   best seller the cheese steak it was heinous   think a grimy mechanically separated salisburystyle steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced italian bread served signature primantistyle with coleslaw tomatoes and fries  first the steak was disgusting terrible flavor smelled and tasted like hippie armpit which im not necessarily opposed to as long as its not involved in something im trying to eat with a gross processed meat texture secondly the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich with their old fryer grease taste additionally the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turna trait i dont hold against decenttasting sandwiches but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury   my dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices corned beef and ham  cheese sandwiches respectively easily the best part of the meal was the smallman street fries and those were equally lackluster the bacon was simply bacon bits oh the humanity the chili was uninspired and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries did i mention they tasted like old fryer grease    i will never go back and i will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks primanti bros produces decent food.
when theres this much hype about a place its hard to live up to but they did a pretty damn good job maybe not the best sandwich ive ever had in my life but if it was any random sandwich shop id happened to stumble into it would definitely be five stars without a second thought  the chili cheese fries were among the best ive ever had i dont know what they do to them  its not the chili thats particularly great its not the cheese thats particularly great and its not the fries that are particularly great but somehow putting them all together just turns it into unbeatable awesome  the sandwich itself i got the corned beef was very good despite the fact that i hate coleslaw but they dont mean the typical mayoandcarrotandpurpleonion colesla.
ive heard all the hype and wanted to try it  tonight was my second attempt here   first time new girl on the grill apologized to me at  minutes at  i walked  not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff   tonight the waiter seemed mad that i didnt know what i wanted to order  after i explained that id never been there he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for  minutes  i walked again  no more tries here  maybe im doing something wrong  haha.
this place holds a nostalgic appeal for people born and raised in pittsburgh who grew up eating here if that experience is what your looking for please visit if youre looking for a tasty meal go somewhere else  stars for history  for food quality and flavor.
