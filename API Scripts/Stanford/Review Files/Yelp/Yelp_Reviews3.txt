my favorite pizza in the city hoagies are also pretty good but the pizza takes the spotlight one of the best places to shoot pool in the south hills next door what more do you need.
i stopped at rohrich toyota to look at their selection of used vehicles i was quickly greeted by paul  who was great i test drove a honda element which was clean and comfortable to drive but the brakes on this one needed work  very slow response to stop then i looked at a rav the first thing i noticed was dog hair on the interior surfaces im surprised that seemingly simple things like brakes and cleanliness would not have been checked and fixed before putting the vehicles on the lo.
first their clothing is arranged by color not by size while thrift stores may think this looks great its not great for people shopping for one size  also their prices were outrageous many of the items i liked i could have bought new for a little bit more the upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store we wont be back to this one.
stopped by last week  store was going to close for a couple of weeks for remodel and i think a cafe will be put in the front    the pita bread is made fresh daily as are many of the other prepared foods  you can watch the pita being made thru the window in the bakery  the pita is wonderful and you can pick up so many delicious mediterranean food items to take home  olive oil olives cheeses hoummus dip baba ghannouj deserts halva specialty pita pies    good food and friendly service.
currently sitting in the restaurant got seated very quickly around pm for the first time ever the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fiancue in it we sat until  without so much as a hello from a nearby server people were sat after us and have already received food we finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed she then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses ive never received great service here but its never been this subpar either this may be the last straw for this place three strikes and youre out markpi  ps i ordered a diet coke and received a glass of what seems to be robitussin that or theres alcohol in this drink either case im not thrilled.
so just finished my meal with my family here and i will not go back the waitress who i dont know her name because it was never shared was polite and efficient the only redeeming quality i found in the meal was my  glasses of wine not that the food was bad it just wasnt good i ordered moo shoo pork with  chinese pancakes once it arrived i was looking forward to it as the main dish looked appetizing then i opened my chinese pancakes omg they served me steamed tortillas i was expecting the crepe style chinese pancakes and instead i had flour tortillas steamed growing up and just having moved to pittsburgh from the west coast i know a tortilla when im served one and it wasnt even handmade freshly cooked tortillas that you get at a chain joint like chevys but pull em out of the bag from giant eagle tortilla this not only killed the meal but when the  tab came i was aghast my wife and two kiddos had decent meals but just because you serve large portions doesnt mean youre serving  dollars worth of food i felts cheated by high prices for mediocre chinese notice the little c food from a place that used to be rated as  great chinese restaurant but that was back in  as the plaques on the wall gleefully point ou.
i ate here this past saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions  we arrived at around  pm and were quoted for a  minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back  the wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of il pizzaiolo  the wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door  eventually the crowd quieted down and i was able to see a beautiful bar a fireplace with chairs bookcases full of books on wine and italy and some trendy paintings  after about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room  the main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that i can remember that really stuck out  our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the arancini since we were hungry  it came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good  for dinner i was having a hard time deciding on whether i should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both  my pasta entree was the paglia e fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce  the tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce  it also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever i was done  my pizza was the diavola since i like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami chile pepper basil and different cheese  once again the colors were nice and i absolutely loved the pizza especially some of the pieces where i got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese  my dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service  the bottom line for me is that i would definitely come back here in the future  the food was fantastic and not as expensive as i had expected while the service was good  i would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into.
this place has the best pizza ive ever had besides keste and paulie gs in nyc  wood fired greatness  expect to wait on weekends in a crowded wine bar  fantastic red sauce and olive oil  not extensive on the wine list but good by the glass selection a gem in pittsburgh.
rating is based largely on the snottiness of the staff  we werent sure if children or nonlocals were not appreciated  we walked into a virtually empty restaurant at  on a monda.
im not sure what the mtlebo hype is about this place the portions are small the place is small and the foods no more than average i have been there twice now thinking the first time might have been a fluke weve heard so much about it that i have super high expectations their wine bar in the back is cute but small we couldnt even lift our elbows to sip our drink while the waiters and service are good the food is just not impressive the pasta i got was good but nothing to write home about i got a pizza the second time i visited and it had a horrid taste i dont know if it was the spinach or the cheese but something was very potent theyre pricy as well the only thing i will give them credit for their italian wedding soup theres practically nothing in it as they use think rice instead of noodles but the broth and meatballs are to die for overall not impressed i probably wont return.
just way to expensive for what it is its good but not at the prices they choose  for wedding soup it was good but not at that price and if i wouldve been told it was that much was a special i wouldve passed service was fine but not attentive and slow as well just so many other good italian places in the area for half the price eggplant parm was enjoyable.
i think this restaurant fits american taste because i was the only non american to eat here just now even though the seats are fully occupied it doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine it is very chinese and i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant the sushi is not even firmly made  i am not saying the food is bad it is actually alright   but they have a great interior and place.
i came here craving some sushi  looked up the best reviewed sushi place in my area and found this little restaurant  i was excited at the front because it was a small restaurant and i love supporting small mom and pops    i figured this may be a little diamond in the rough  man was i wrong  the sushi was not fresh  the sushi wasnt rolled tight either  the rice didnt have the trademark sushi rice flavor   spoiled by the fresh ingredients and catches of california i felt like the ingredients were sort of old  considering i went in on a saturday i figured it might be better but it wasnt at all  the service was good  thats the justification for the  stars  otherwise i really wouldnt recommend this place to other people.
some good some bad  this goes for the food and the service  you must check your order if its to go in any of the locations  i have had more mistakes than correct orders in the last year or so    the presses are microwaves  they are not training their employees to know this and they are not making it public  i had an employee actually argue about it with me this morning because i wanted them to toast my bagel and assemble the egg and cheese without nuking it  i got to my car and they had forgotten the cheese  i went back and the cook told me that the counter person didnt know if i wanted it  i think someone should have double checked if this was the case as the sandwich comes with cheese to begin with  even burger king doesnt microwave their breakfast.
this should say it all we found a dress we loved it was in our price range butwe didnt return because of the customer service  i suppose we could have gotten over it to get the dress but we just didnt want that negative experience to taint our wedding it was all going so well too the people helping us were very down to earth very accommodating and helpful patient and knowledgeable but when we told them that we werent ready to buy the dress it was like jekyll and hyde and we were given attitude and a cold shoulder were talking passiveaggressive teenagerlike behavior let me be clear  we didnt say no we didnt say we were going to go somewhere else  all we said was that we werent ready in all likelihood we were going to be back in a couple weeks and buy and just wanted to think about it one more time its a purchase that costs thousands of dollar.
the staff and the craft brew selection is great with games dart boards and a pool table the kp is a great local hangout   linda.
boring pretentious mall with old dated stores.
racist mall management team same team that ran century  mall in to the ground stay away nothing good comes out this place.
worst experience with a hairdresser ever at this location made an appointment with diane for a body wave when i was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said you get body waves yeah thats why i booked one at your salon then she argued with me about when to trim i wanted after she wanted before and after five minutes acknowledged that it didnt matter but first telling me the perm wouldnt soak in on the ends unless she trimmed it then she argued with me about the rods its taken me over ten years to figure out with aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is diane knew better but finally agreed then she proceeded to comb my wet hair from the forehead back scratching my scalp and jerking my head that wasnt enough though she then started rolling it with the rods she thought i should have  i got up and left when i addressed the problem at the front no effort was made to help me other than to offer coming back and talking to the owner yeah right thats gonna happen horrible salondirty also just as a side note.
great products and katie has been the best.
internet connection     wifi router    daily internet pass    losing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless   for a day pass or  for a monthly pass is just ridiculous especially when the place is so computer friendly with lots of ac plugs for laptop users  if you are going to just have coffee then miss is review is right on the spot but if you are going to work or study and need access to the internet then go somewhere else.
theyre a great local alternative to starbucks and they make kickass drinks ive had mochas here hot and cold and chai tea lattes here hot and cold all were delicious about the same price as you would find at starbucks but they have those cute little stickers for decorating your cup and im all about the stickers theyre usually seasonally themed and are always adorable its the little things people.
i was walking around and decided to try this place out i asked for a recommendation on a type of ground coffee to take home the ladies where very helpful and knowledgable i love the coffee thank you.
great place to study considering ive spent entire afternoons and evenings there cramming for exams the staff is really friendly and if you get a ceramic mug refills for coffee are free.
i dont normally come to this laundromat but the machines in my apartment had been broken for a week and i was getting desparate  although parking can be a bit of a pain i was pleasantly surprised with this place  there are plenty of washers and dryers to choose from from regular sized to freakin  pound capacity and they all seemed to be working great  its airconditioned and clean with vending machines and some old arcade games to spend some more of your quarters on  my sister and i did four loads of laundry and it cost us about  per load  oh yeah and they have a change machine that apparently takes    and  dollar bills  if i am ever in a pinch again i will be coming here.
ick  stay away unless you want to be treated like you are a criminal who cannot afford a pricey item  i wanted to try on a  furand the guy said it was very expensive and would hand carry it to the front mirror for me  he then advised me to take off my vest and waited for me to do so  he would not let me handle the coat myself because it was very expensive  he watched me while i tried it on and then immediately took it off me  i wanted to tell him that  wasnt pricey for a winter coat and that i could easily afford it but decided to walk out without purchasing it  i wont be back.
i hate to put two stars but i have experienced better especially for the price this was my first visit and frankly it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant  there were definitely good points the service was great and i enjoyed the cocktail that i ordered off the menu also they had a couple of lesserknown cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing the wine by the glass menu had nice choices too  unfortunately the food was mixed i had the pork dumplings for an appetizer the combination of flavors in the filling dip and wrapper was very good but the wrapper was unusually thick and distractingly chewy even gummy as in it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy the server said theyd just started making their wrappers inhouse and i think they need some work  i had the chicken ramen soup for a main course it just wasnt very good i didnt expect it to be up to vancouver bc standards that city seems to have a thing for ramen but the noodles were a bit tough and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt this includes the broth and the chicken i didnt really want to eat i.
pretty good food fantastic atmosphere slightly overpriced but not unreasonable for the quality and atmosphere.
hands down the most disrespectful and terrible lounge in pittsburgh appalling  service i went there with  people restaurant was empty and sat there for twenty minutes with staff walking by the lounge was empty was there from  she didnt check on us once we had to flag her down  complained to the manager with no response nyc prices as well very embarrassed for the big burrito company.
this is a better than average lets say very solid  sushi restaurant    we had the omakase and had some delicious bite sized courses  but strangely the little bites never added up to feeling super full which could be a good thing but devouring a chocolate pretzel dessert isnt really the perfect end to omakase    the miso black cod was excellent the sashimi was well executed and clearly the chef had many many years of traditional sushi training  but for some reason my socks just werent blown off  more sushi and sashimi could have done the trick  on the other hand the desserts were delicious and memorable which come from the restaurant downstairs soba  great atmosphere attentive service and will def go back  at the same time im open to finding alternatives in pittsburgh too optimistic  and dr freddie fu is a fan see autographed picture on sushi bar  not sure what this means but maybe if i return i will be further enlightened.
umi is alright  what i mean by this is that the food is high quality and the service is high quality but for some reason im never completely satisfied when i leave  lets start with the good  they have great quality sushi  they have interesting taste combinations  the decor is fun especially if you sit in the traditional seating area where you dont actually sit on the floor if you can ever manage to get in and out of this seating in a graceful manner kudos to you    but the portions are small and every time weve eaten here we come away with the sense of great meal but holy moly  dunno if it was xxx good  well continue to come but probably only if someone else is paying  in the meantime its off to tamari we go.
harris grill was long one of my favorite spots to goto just about any night of the week  however its changed in recent months and i dont think i will return  on a recent thursday night my friend and i had possibly the worst waitress ever  her name was amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress  she was not present for about  minutes after we were sat  she finally appeared and asked us for our drink order she disappeared for about  minutes before returning  she served us our drinks then immediately left for another table it was another  to  minutes before she came by again this time taking our order for food  she return  minutes later with another round of drinks which we dont remember ordering but we werent going to complain we never saw her the rest of the night  other waitresses were making their rounds every  minutes out on the patio but ours never appeared once  i thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition  i even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay  she said they would check  she returned not long after and said she was alright  i relaxed a little until another  minutes went by it was now about  minutes since we had ordered and no food  we waited a bit longer we still hadnt seen amanda our waitress for those paying attention  an hour went by and we had had enough i really couldnt believe this  not only did we not have our food but we hadnt seen our waitress in an hour  an hour  what the hell.
no complaints about this place i tend to gravitate towards this place mid afternoon with my laptoplove the vibe here outdoor patio or nice window seating upstairs creative menu as well check it out.
we went to harris grill for lunch while a friend was visiting from out of townand it was fun the menu and atmosphere is pretty entertaining the food and drinks are moderately priced and there is a nice selection of brews  what we had  turkey burgerfabulouswe agreed this was the best thing we had  i added mozzarella cheese and it was soooo good  flat iron porki guess our friend thought he was ordering flat iron steakthis was ok but i wouldnt get it again  some spicy chicken sandwichpretty goodpaled in comparison to the turkey burger  totsdelicious  beergood duh  other servicefab   patiosfront and back.
overall a decent yet confusing experience pros its like living in an apt because its spacious and has a kitchen and laundry room downstairs theres even free laundry soap available in the laundry room its located next to a lot of restaurants and shops some of the staff has been friendly in providing things including shuttle rides cons extremely inconsistent room cleaning service if youre staying for an extended period of time they only clean your room once a week on an assigned day the problem is they dont show on the assigned day to clean my roommate and i have ended up calling the office sometimes twice before its cleaned also someone in our  building had  stolen out of her drawer and the management told her not to call the cops they ended up cutting her check but not before a lot of stern talk i wouldnt stay here againif you do make sure that you use the safe provided in the room and expect to do a lot of the maid services yourself.
since my return to pittsburgh i have been to the new elbow room several times the food has always been decent and the location on walnut is convenient when im in the neighborhood shopping    today i went for a late lunch  honestly there were  people in the restaurant  it took forever for food to arrive at our table  could it be attributed to the fact that i was eating somewhere between lunch and dinner and they arent sufficiently staffed  i dont know  my beloved was happy as always with his enormous fish sandwich  my reuben sandwich was just okay  the corned beef was pretty chewy  probably should have gotten a salad    im hoping that i just caught them on a bad afternoon.
i dont know how this place has stayed in business for so long  it has never appealed to me yet some family member drags me there every five years or so  it never changes it seems like an independently owned chilis  the menu is boring  the food nothing special    most recently i ordered a salad and asked for some rolls or bread and they didnt have anything except for some super spongy italian sliced bread that tasted like a step up from wonder bread  my beet salad had such crunch beets they were barely cooked  grapefruit segments were all membrane  lettuce was ice cold nearly frozen    see you in another five years.
i got a groupon for dean of shadyside for hairline highlights deep conditioning masque and a hair cut for   i had never been but i gave it a try  the groupon was for a level  stylist and i had erika  she was pretty great  ive never had highlights before and she helped me figure out what would look good  my highlights look great the cut looks great she did exactly what i wanted her to do  i never make hair appointments far in advance but i prebooked my next appointment  i would highly recommend this place and i recommend erika as well.
let me start by saying i was given a coupon for a free haircut and mani  you have to really let me down with free to get a twostar review  the haircut  lets put it this wayafter i went home and rewashed and restyled it i was really happy with it  i really liked the girl i had  i thought that she cut it just how i wanted  but then she asked if i wanted her to straighten it and i said no thanks because i have wavy hair thats pretty easy to make fancy read easy as in i dont use products or heat almost ever thanks even though its quite long  somehow she made my wash n wear waves into a frizzy stuff hot mess with some combination of gels and spray  then she told me she was going to dry my hair to  dry before sending me to the mani and then check on me later  okayyyyyy  overall haircut  style   stars  the mani this mani brought down the average rating of my visit as id give it one star  i havent gotten a lot of manismaybe a half dozen times for fancy eventsbut i know a bad one  it was freaking dirty at the mani station where a different girl did my nails  the towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it  seriously get some bleach  then i figured out what the stains werethe girl made me bleed on two fingers while cutting my cuticles  one bled quite a bit  but she just pretended like it wasnt happening and continued to chatter on about black friday shopping and her plan to score big  had the mani station not been in the very back of the salon i would have ran away whenthis is trueshe got up to use the restroom in the middle of mani  um i usually do my own nails but im guessing this isnt normal  as if she were aiming for the worst mani ever the polish wasnt even within the lines at all  then she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said shes get the stylist  mani   star  the stylist didnt come back after a couple minutes  when i asked the receptionist where the stylist was she didnt know  i just wanted to get out of there  so i took off the smock and left with wet hair and nails  i was pretty bummed since i had specifically scheduled the appointment on that particular afternoon because i had a big event that evening  i actually felt like a sucker tipping at more than  for these services  but i had put the tips in the little envelopes before i got my nails done and i didnt want to wait for them to dry to decrease the tip  so i tipped and left  summary free isnt great when you have to go home and immediately wash your hair and remove the nail polish.
went to a high tea here on sunday  although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming the food was nothing special in fact it was bad  we were served three tea sandwiches  egg salad which was bland i make a better version at home chicken salad nothing special either and then a delicious spinachartichoke bite  unfortunately it was the size of a quarter it was literally a bite  but it was the best part of the meal  i dont think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread  we were offered two types of scones  cranberry and eggnog   neither was anything special eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever  then the pastries  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was finenothing like vanilla pastry shop  a pumpkin torte again fine  and a chocolate moussebrownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on topit was dry as a bone  it looked as if it was on its last legschocolate was turning white mouse separated from brownie  yuck    oh yeahi had a delicious tea from harney and sons used to be sold at the grand floridian high tea in disney world cinnamon spice  unfortunately when i asked for more tea they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag   ive gone to various teas so i feel i can give a good comparison  not impressed at all  will not go back there ever.
first giant eagle is convenient it open early and closes late on a daily basis i have yet to find another store that sells the same variation of food in a unitary complex and despite its size the supermarket is clean and the employees are knowledgeable on the status and location of most items  second the prices for nonproduce items are competitive if not better than nearby competing stores the produce items tend to be more expensive but to be fair nearly all if it is fresh  third giant eagle offers a brand guarantee and a return policy which assure customer satisfactio.
you can speak to maurice about adding brewskis to the make your own six pack if one you want isnt there.
i never really understood why docs was so popular  i personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck  otherwise the prices suck beer served in  ounce cups on special for   come on the food is mediocre and the atmosphere is nonexistent  the drinks are weak as well    if youre looking for a night out there are better places close by in shadyside  the deck really is nice but it doesnt help the fact that the prices are terrible for drinks especially for what you get  that being said i end up here a lot because others seem to like itmaybe im missing something.
food very good seasonal menu with at least  vegetarian friendly entrees when i was there soups werent vegfriendly all three entrees we ordered particularly the gnocchi were excellent house dressing is good too  drinks full liquor selection and good beer choices too  atmosphere we sat outside and the patio is great unique arrangement feels very european  service prompt friendly overall very good   connected to creamery upstairs so if they run out of a specific desert always great options to bring back to your table   could have used more bread both in the basket and refilled more often.
my girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when i came in town for the steelers game we did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around pm fully expecting a long wait my girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited we ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for  minutes without anyone taking down our name a few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy owner took down names we were ignored several times by him as he came up front  no biggie we saw it was busy an older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped we replied no and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the list we were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman his wife and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes the entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant where we were awkwardly standing as well the older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it he kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of out of towners who will never come back again which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before   we subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman this was the most absurd display at a restaurant i have ever seen my girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying this was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his wifeemployee with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night.
beware the loudmouthed lout working the front we stopped by a couple nights ago and asked to check the menu finding it acceptable  despite an abundance of starch with minimal protein  we walked away to go find the other members of our party to return and ask for a table but we were accosted by a boorish old man who kept yelling hey until we turned around to see what he wanted come to find out he wanted to insult us by telling us to check out the hamburgers across the street if we didnt want or couldnt afford his fare well needless to say we didnt go back and had a fine dinner elsewhere tip to the house insulting the public is no way to win friends or customers.
never had any experience with rudeness here or any other problem they make the best beans and greens around and i order this dish at every italian restaurant  brothy just the right amount of saltiness and just right for sopping up whatevers left on the plate with their delicious crusty bread  the salad with gorgonzola is also pretty amazing  a great neighborhood standby.
i am a nice amicable person i treat others with kindness and have a highly positive attitude i rarely complain about things thus it makes me sad to write a negative review however the way in which mozart management staff have behaved and conducted themselves over the past two years warrants this review we moved to pittsburgh when i was in graduate school we loved our tiny cute apartment at schenley arms our first home as a couple this abruptly changed when simple calls to request that they salt the driveway were met with aggression irritability and statements such as we have never had a complaint before and we cannot accommodate your schedule i felt guilty at first about calling but then had an epiphany and realized that mozart has serious issues the tone of their written  correspondence is also highly intimidating demeaning and threatening i will not bore you with the additional myriad of complaints that exist what ever happened to customer service decency and basic regard for other human beings            if you value your hard earned money and do not want to be met with criticism and hostility when interacting with your landlordavoid at all costs also there are a fair amount of negative reviews when you do a search on googleread and believe them they are completely mean and disrespectful this is not the kind of business i want to support as it conflicts with my value system we are moving out asap when our lease expires   ps the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve  stars i hope they arent treated as bad as the tenants.
they just broke into my house without any notice to show around they knocked so violently i almost mistaked it for gunfire then before i was able to say anything they broke in there was at most  seconds interval between the knock and the break in i wasnt dressed and the guy just said oh hi were showing the apartment and stormed into my kitchen ridiculous i started ranting as soon as they left the room this is totally invasive and disrespectful i didnt read their lease very carefully when i moved in and i totally regret it they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day so i thought whatever how bad could it be apparently breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here and if you dont comply theyll fine you as much as your units monthly rent around  for telling them no you cant enter the house ive heard of several cases like this theyre unbelievably hostile and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible.
breakfast is always good but too much pamelas seems greasy you can cook it all at home for much cheaper however the pricing really is low when youre lazy the wait is ridicious at times i would recommend the shadyside location over the other two its more clean and better parking cash only.
woah thank goodness for yelp thats how i learned about this breakfast gem the boy just moved to pa so we went out foraging for breakfast but before i did i did a quick yelp search we headed to pamelas as soon as i saw the reviews   there were about  people hovering outside so went in to put our name down heres my only complaint we waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down but then about  people just cut in front of the line which was a bit rude   the seating is tight but the atmosphere dineresque upon the walls are some differing varieties of art some for sale no less   the menu while not particularly healthconscious was heavy on eggs and pancakes we went with the specialty pancakes bananawalnut and choc chip  both were delicious i really wanted to and tried to finish mine but i just couldnt man up   the other complaint which is of nofault of the restaurant was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene despite the deliciousness of the food things got tense for a while   i think the next time i have a serious pankcakehankering ill find myself wishing boston had a pamelas.
two words grossly overrated if i am going to wait an hour for breakfastbrunch it needs to not only be good but also unique unfortunately pamelas is neither of these things then again the hourlong wait does provide you will ample time to find a atm because they only take cash if you want to wait in line for an hour for food that is both good and unique try coca cafe.
im from california and hotcakes is something thats not common in our food vocabulary we just settle on pancakes and call it a day  my brother took me and my mother to pamelas for brunch and it was pretty packed fortunately it was only a  minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us i glanced through the menu and learned that theyre known for their specialty hotcakes they all looked very good but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes was craving strawberries we finally got seated ordered what we want and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner the food came out relatively fast and i was ecstatic for my hotcakes they use fresh strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can the hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part a bit heavy on the butter but thats how you get the crispiness the sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element as for the brown sugar that was like the cherry on top it was pure harmony  definitely check it out when youre in pittsburgh.
i like chinese food  americanized or authentic from the streets of wuhan or a plaza in monroeville i have enjoyed it  in light of that china palace on walnut street is well kind of okay  the positives   the vegetarian menu has an especially good selection  im not a vegetarian but i usually order from that menu just because its something different  the food isnt terrible either but its not great  its also usually easy to get a table last time i went there i tried to go to pamelas first but it was a saturday afternoon so there was no hope of getting in  oh and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all  the negatives  dim lighting that makes me want to sleep  its not romantic just dim  the only waitress ive had there is pretty rude  shes just not cut out for waiting tables or interacting with people in general  my minimum tip is  even at the cheapest places  she got  because she didnt do the minimum amount of customer service i require to give my minimum tip  the food is only okay    all in all if youre on walnut and you can avoid china palace try something else  you wont hate your experience here but it wont be memorable either  i will probably return though for the cheap lunch specials but thats because im moving out of country soon and i need to save every penny i can not because i really love the place.
we order takeout here several times a month the food is always very good and quite plentiful for a takeout order the quality seems pretty consistent as well they even called me back once to double check something on the order that was really nice delivery times are always good and theyre very fast on slow days meals in the restaurant or also highquality my wife and i have probably eaten here  times in the last five years.
had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years  we shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps  both were delicious and im freaking thrilled when a restaurant knows what a caramelized onion is supposed to look like  my flatbread was smothered in them just the way i like it  the sashimi was nothing crazy i liked the grilled pineapple with it    my husband got himself a burger the barbecue one to be exact and i had the wild mushroom pasta  i was concerned it would be too similar to the flatbread but the server raved about it so i tried it anyway    my husband enjoyed his burger though he thought it could have been less salted  he was happy that the temperature was correct also   the salad that came with my entree was ok  the blue cheese dressing was eh the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda squishy and i actually spit out a crouton  it had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil  i usually love croutons too  the pasta was tasty but almost too tasty if that makes sense  too many competing flavors  my husband was thrilled that they got al dente right when he had a bite  id also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch but there arent a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat  overall id eat here again and get the same apps and a lighter entree.
this restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance that is where the positive ends the food is lousy i paid  for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen ok it was thawed but had previously been frozen corn about  tablespoons of black beans and the same amount of feta as a vegetarian this salad was one of two that had some sort of substance to make one think of a meal what a disappointment  i wont be back.
everything about the pedi was ok except the polishing part   hours later i had to wear shoes and the polish smudged because it was slopped on so thick it never would have dried   as she was polishing my nails i was thinking man that is way too thick  itll never dry but i didnt say anything because i thought maybe she had some super topcoat that would make the impossible possible  well she didnt and the polish stayed not just tacky but downright wet for  hours before i finally just scraped the goop off and painted them myself    i will never be back and wish i had saved my  i had a groupon and my  tip  should have just done them myself.
our wedding cake and dessert table vendor was included in our reception package so im sure the owners are going to say we didnt pay them directly so what i write doesnt matter ive seen this response in other negative reviews  in my opinion that should not matter  we should still receive the same type of respect courtesy and professionalism that all clients should receive  this was not the case  i wont rewrite what i posted last year about our issues with the dessert table and the attitude of linda but what i am posting about now is our  year anniversary cake top  we were given a certificate in our package for a free fresh cake made in our wedding cake flavors  linda even wrote the flavors on the card  i was really excited to taste the cake since my husband and i didnt really get a chance to during our reception  they gave us a plain chocolate cake with white icing  this is not what our wedding cake was  when i called and asked if there was a mistake i was told someone would call me back  of course they didnt  so i called again and spoke with steve who laughed at me when i asked why we didnt receive a cake in our wedding flavors and then had the audacity to say well you got a free cake  really  it wasnt good and it was a plain cake i could have made myself  when i said thats not the point he said what do you want me to do  another cake fine  when do you want to pick it up  when we picked up the second cake again in was the same cake as before  i have yet to try my own wedding cake flavor  they are so rude cocky and ignorant  i will never go to the bakery again nor will i ever recommend it to anyone else.
there were six employees behind the counter and one customer waiting for their sandwich to be made and i was the only person in line and couldnt get a single person to take my order  walked out and got faster service at panera which had a line out the door  oh well.
please dont go here im begging you i wouldnt wish this place on my own worst enemy i wouldnt wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend this place was a literal nightmare   i think ive been to jimmy wans  times this month so i was sick of it plus id heard good things about taipei so i thought id give it a whirl  the service was abysmal  my waiter took  minutes to recognize id sat down he was very kind but only dropped my food off no hows it going no water refills no offer of dessert or other courses a kind busboy kept refilling my drink   the portions are extremely small  ive never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life the menu says theres a charge for fried rice instead of white huh jimmy wans offers white and brown no extra charge interesting  the atmosphere was atrocious  a family in the table to my left and in front let their child  or  mind you take off his shoes and walk around he then ground his heel into the carpet  with a piece of chicken in between he swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet i audibly gasped but his obese mother couldnt hear me or ignored me then she threatened to take each of their kindles away if they didnt shut up the boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long  the waitstaff saw what was happening and didnt care at all my waiter didnt show up after i was finished with my meal and when he did after id requested someone else get him he failed to clear my dirty plates i finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was  namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if i wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy youthink i want something to go how were  people in the  seat restaurant and one small takeout order howis that busy  other reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands if you care about your health dont go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesnt care if children grind chicken into the carpet if they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen i have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking  jews dont go here on christmas even if though they loudly advertise theyre open if  people means theyre busy can you imagine what itll be like on christmas  the slowness of the whole establishment is astounding i dropped my little brother off at jimmy wans immediately before going to taipei  a  second drive between establishments wans parking lot was jam packed and he ate with  other friends he called me to pick him up as i was paying the bill how the hell did taipei take as long as jimmy wans did to seat and serve and bill  people as they did me the th person in their restaurant  only go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist.
they take great care of our pets here we rarely have much of a wait and all of the staff are courteous and talented in handling and caring for pets all of the vets we have met with were professional friendly and very capable.
excellent food with great service.
okay food  number of other guests is often zero  uncomfortable.
says they deliver on here wrong  wrong again  should not be checked i like applebees  thought the delivery was something new for the pittsburgh area dont know if this is something yelp does or something someone checked off but not cool.
this hotel is in need of a renovation this becomes most apparent when you look at the bathrooms which have fixtures and mildew growth both from the seventies ive stayed in motels that were cleaner and better appointed  i could have done without the sleep number bed but thats probably more of a personal preference than anything however it appeared to me that the money would have been better spent on updating the rooms themselves apparently it used to be a marriott some time ago  im guessing they decided to drop the brand rather than update to marriotts standards  the continental breakfast was a crime  for buffet style eggs from a bag no less sausage french toast and oily potato cubes they were trying to say were home fries is unconscionable passing on this gastronomic atrocity i decided to invest my money in an english muffin and two  oz yogurts only option is strawberry banana really  at least there was a pretty nice pool where we could oh closed for private party just as well  thankfully this was a business trip and the client is paying expenses otherwise i might have actually felt upset.
waited for last hotel bus which scheduled before pm from conventional center to hotel from  to  pm no bus showed up i called front desk they told me be patient  i waited and called them again around pm they hang up my phone after i explained the purpose of the phone call i called them third time around pm no response  hope they will improve quality of their service.
perhaps it was an off night but we were really disappointed in our takeout my husbands pork fried rice was not fried ricestill dont know what it was his gen tsos chicken was flat and my cashew chicken was flavorless in the past it has been good food.
i live about  minutes from belmont thus i do most of my shopping there as opposed to heading into the city itself and lets face it going down wilkinson toward uptown isnt exactly the best place to shop  i mix up my groceries between harris teeter walmart and bilo  this bilo in particular usually has a lot of helpful folks its very conveniently located and is open all the time  i prefer the deli here over walmart lets say and you can usually get a lot of items on sale that are cheaper than walmart as well  but not a lot of the stuff that isnt on sale  if you are looking for a grocery store in and around belmont this is probably the best place to go.
wanted something close and my husband suggested sub corral so we gave it another shot  i called in the order and the manboy that took the order was not friendly at all no thank you just a give me  minutes and hung up   the food was awful  i got the meatball sub and it was nasty unedible and the pizza was not good  i will never go again  i used to drive  minutes to get this pizza but now living in belmont i will not even drive  minutes for it  so dissapointing.
get your wallet ready the prices are crazy high.
will never come here again  my cat has cancer and was experiencing some new symptoms that needed possible ultrasounds we came to this cvs location because it was after hours and the cvs i usually go to in matthews wasnt going to have the ultrasound tech as soon as needed so we drove  minutes in the opposite direction to this location in huntersville  when we walked in around pm on a friday the place was packed to the brim all the exam rooms were full and there were about  people in the lobby okay so maybe that night we just had bad luck  no our greeting at the front desk was awful the secretary didnt even make eye contact with us and acted like we were inconveniencing her she was appalling and rude   we were told we would have to wait at least an hour because they were overly busy which we understood after a couple hours we asked if we could just check our sick kitty into the icu for the night and leave because we knew she needed overnight supervision  well the secretary didnt even come relay the no response to us  luckily not all of the staff were as dreadful as the secretary but we ended up waiting over  hours until am only to be told that they were admitting her into the icu overnight and running tests exactly as we requested before i know the protocol was to have the doctor chat a moment in person before we left but we felt that common sense wasnt being put to use at this facility.
great place good pizza that tastes great and is very authentic we had a mushroom and sausage and we were very impressed you wont be disappointed.
had a rare only person in the house night so i decided to treat myself     i have passed by the panda for years and have always wanted to stop by but my wife is very picky about chinese food   with only me i had the perfect opportunity  i stopped in on the way home on tuesday july rd to order and go   entered and found really nothing to write home about the interior decor  but i am of the mindset that if the decor is not great the food usually is  long experiences with mexican restaurants in the west  there were several people in the front area either waiting for their food or waiting to order  but nobody sitting down  it was early in the evening though  i love general tsos chicken and most of the time it is not that spicy to appeal to a wider audience   i ordered the dinner special which came with fried rice and an egg roll   i could see thru to the kitchen behind the counter and was able to watch as my food was prepared  it came quickly and i took it home  as i was leaving there were more people coming in  i got home and grabbed a beer and got into my order  and the general tsos was spicy  the way it should be  it was a generous portion and the fried rice was flavorful  the egg roll well it was an egg roll but i love egg rolls as well  be mindful this was just a review of one dish  i do have to go back and try more.
worst service in the area by far   once we were seated it took the waitress  minutes to make her way to our table to take our drink order  we finally decided to settle up  minutes after placing our order   the food never made it to our table   i have eaten at this restaurant before and  the service wasnt so bad   the food is generally pretty good  if you want to order chicken definitely get it shredded.
having been in charlotte only a year id despaired of finding good german cuisine in the qc  turns out you have to go to pineville  also turns out its well worth the drive  the waldhorn is a little kitschy but appropriately so  their tap selection is wellchosen and good  the rolls are pretzely and fantastic  the sauerkraut is sauer enough though they do the sweet carawayseed version  the wurst is the best in charlotte  please dont kill me  we started with the wurst plate served with mustard sauerkraut and rolls  there was plenty and i shouldve stopped there but i hadnt had good german food in a while and was in a celebratory mood  i had the jagerschnitzel  it was made entirely of food  pork was thin crispy and delicious  red cabbage was firm and sweet  spuetzle needed salt but it usually does  heated up well the next day alsothere was a lot of it  she had the venison  sweet lord  that is all  an older gentleman in liederhosen and wielding an accordion played throughout the place but never so loud as to be distracting  i like the accordion though so your mileage may vary  it is a little pricier than i wouldve liked but i dont think that is going to stop me from going back  regularly.
fabulous place   went during queens feast restaurant week and it was very organized and accommodating  food and staff could not be better definitely will come back.
we went to the red lobster at carolina place this past weekend the quantity of the food was grea.
great customer service  convenient location  large assortment of games which is appreciated but the prices are a bit high minus the prices i dig it.
the entrance is hard to findidentify the exit says sears but the entrance has a door that says avisbudget  you have to wait in line to bring your car in for service instead of parking in the lot and going into the shop with your keys  waiting in line took roughly  minutes on a tuesday about  noon    i brought my car in for a simple oil change it took almost  hours  granted when they told me it was done there were several things that diego had found that i could fix in my car the list of repairs totaled over   i didnt bring the car in for an inspection just an oil change thats all i wanted could have saved time elsewhere  it was about  for a high mileage oil change including tax and with a discount coupon  they assured me that the fluids windshield washer power steering etc would be topped of.
my wife and i came in last week to get ourselves a new mattress  our salesman antwan was interested in helping us get the right bed not the most expensive one  we ended up purchasing one had it delivered and put into place the next day  been sleeping great since then  recommend checking them out when your in the market for a new mattress.
food was ok it wasnt bad just nothing great its like the place tries too hard they walk you in through the kitchen cute but gimmicky the place is overfilled with photos and artwork they are nice photos but its distracting almost on purpose as if the food is not the real star of the show it shows in the flavors the service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu my server lost me towards the end he was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him all in all it was ok more focus on food and flavors and less on cliche its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal nothing to remember.
i have been a long time fan but after having a issue with an item i purchased online this christmas i will not be shopping here again i tried to take a item back with the packing slip that came on the item the associate told me i was unable to do the return with the packing slip but she could do it if i had the email confirmation i didnt have it on my phone so i went i found the email sent it back to my phone and tried the return again todays associate told me i could not do the return with the confirmation email but needed the packing slip which i could not find at the time i asked to speak with the manager on duty which the associate called valencia the manager on duty would not come up to speak with me but told the associate that they couldnt do the return i still have this  worth of stuff i dont need i would not recommend anyone from purchasing from kmart.
bought an item from there didnt notice it was an open item until i checked out took it back  days later because one of the buttons didnt work and they refuse to take it back claiming i dropped and damaged it i never dropped it i brought it back to them in the same condition they sold it to me as  then the manager told me we would not have sold one in the condition but they sure sold it to me buyer beware.
this is probably one of the worst olive garden i have been to i am a frequent diner at olive garden but had my first experience with this particular one last week my server was horrific being a previous server myself i can understand the pressures and stress on a busy night however this server was completely inattentive and was rushing my friend and i the entire time our salads came not even five minutes before our food was sent out i am completely disappointed i dont recommend this location to anyone.
great service  very quick definitely use the coupons  and the evaluation was honest and fair  and no pressure is applied  i would go back again.
arrived around midnight and the front desk was ready for us check in was quick and we were able to turn in the room was clean bed comfy the desk was hugebut the bathroom was small breakfast in the morning was very convenient several choices and the coffee hit the spot.
stay away from this aamco they have the worst customer service ever  we purchased a groupon to have our tires rotated and a fuel injection service performed made an appointment and showed up  minutes early only to be informed that they were an hour behind i even called before i went there to see if maybe there was a cancellation so maybe i cold get in and out earlier the person who answered the phone tasha didnt say anything about them being behind had she said so i would have waited  minutes before going there turns out i sat there for almost  hours not good then when it was time for me to check out she tried to charge me   for shop materials well i happen to have worked in a shop and a couple of shop towels doesnt cost  so i picked up my car keys and left next i will be contacting groupon about this shady business.
for an ihop the pineville location is as good as it gets  what do i mean for an ihop  its a fast food franchise whose claim to fame are their fast and fairly inexpensive breakfasts  frame your expectations accordingly and you wont be disappointed  were especially fond of the night crew spring tracy and tiffany.
on yelp a th review is a milestone  its a big deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews its a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  fairpoint communications is such a business  fairpoint took over verizons local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver  in a nutshell it has been a disaster  fairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up  they got the new business when my office moved to portsmouth  one day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service  when that was fixed the lines didnt roll over properly  the billing was never correct  the internet connection required rebooting the dsl modem up to  times a day  calls about all of these issues rarely went well  people were apologetic but problems remained  calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers  two different people in my office were reduced to tears  most people and companies i know with fairpoint in new hampshire and maine are having similar troubles  my company switched carriers recently  fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened  someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then everything has worked perfectly  to fairpoints management i can only say that you bit off more than you could chew  whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didnt care  i hope you are fined out of existence  to new hampshires public utility commission i have to say that i have no idea what you do  i should review you separately  i dont generally give out onestar reviews  this is my th review and only my th onestar review  im not giving details because all of the billing issues arent resolved but i will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in northern new england fairpoint is not the company you want to go with.
friendly staff and all but the bathroom was rundown and the wife lifted the slip around the mattress and the mattress was streaked skanky and old  i had two girls with me and so we needed extra towels but the housekeeper in the hall told me i need a towel from you to give you a towel but anyway we dont have any extra so i cant help you so i walked down to the fitness center and grabbed two towels and the housekeeper looked at me and i looked back at her and i just squeezed by lol  funny another reviewer mentioned a flying beetle in the room we had one of those too i got rid of it myself though lol  also they have the bistro setup i just dont like those at all to get coffee you have to buy it from the bistro instead of the free coffee setup courtyard used to have   for those of us that are marriottloyal i think the fairfield inns are better value they are just as comfortable the beds and pillows are just as good which is really all we care about breakfast is free and they tend to be newer.
ill start my review by stating that ive been working in the food industry for  years now all fine dining  i know what works and what doesnt and what i should expect when eatting at places with that being said  my wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance  i think the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager after saying that we would be hving a  course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in providing an enjoyable experiance  after ordering our first drinks and finishing it a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another drin.
i love al mikes the restaurant is hidden in the beautiful first ward neighborhood theyve got great food a good beer list and a very chill atmosphere i typically get the blue cheese burger while my boyfriend loves to get the london broil sandwich or the pita chicken wrap with honey mustard the fries and onion rings are delicious too plus its nonsmoking which i love i just wish it stayed open later.
this was bar food heaven looks like a regular neighborhood bar on the outside and inside we stopped by around  and there was about a  minute wait for a table the places looks like it only fits about  people max   waiting for a table we sat at the bar and i noticed they had a great beer selection on tap and im not talking anhueser busch bs lots of craft beers and a good amount of local brews i tried a few high abv brews that were really good and put my head in another world i had been in town for about  hours by this time im really liking charlotte for dinner i tried something called what it is its a cajun pasta dish being cajun i was hesitant to try cajun food so far away from the deep south but they came though i considered licking the plate i was actually sopping up the sauce with bread like i usually only do at home i was thoroughly impressed.
in  reviews no one has given this place below  stars  that should tell you all you need to know  consistently good bar food in a quiet publike environment service is always consistent too  nothing fancy  but thats perfect for me  go for the london broil sammy at lunch  reasonably priced and delicious  if i had a magic wand and could change a few things about this restaurant id focus on parking and adding more tables  street parking in a quiet neighborhood can be limited  ive been here a handful of times when there has been a line out the door with people waiting for a table  both faults however are incredibly hard to control.
run to alexander michaels this christmas season for dinner or drinks  you will thank me     tucked away in th ward which in and of itself is reason enough to head to am it is quaint and right now decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights i love twinkly things  it truly looks out of a movie  and the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly  a little bit magical    i was a th ward resident and kinda lived at am for a few years and had not been in awhile  we went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my alltime favorite venues the fillmore but i digress  great beer selection  we all had different meals nachos are delish salsa not so much my hubs said the burger was good fried pickles yum veggie pita was great but you have to get the what it is  what it is sustained me for years  im veggie now so no chicken for me but it was good all those nights  while the food is not star worthy the atmosphere the bar the beer selection the people and the staff make this a star establishment for sure.
great place tucked away in th ward youd never know it was there only caveat is that parking is nearimpossible strict street parking rules make it tough to come here if youre driving   london broil sandwhich was clutch good ambiance as well   hope to return soon.
had a great time at al miikes this week the food was greatl the locals and the staff or great for company the bartender suggested todays special meatloaf mash and gravy awesome comfort food to go along with the warm welcoming locally owned and managed bar and restaurant if you havent been to al mikes you are truly missing out on an amazing all around warm neighborhood tavern experience charlottes version of cheers where you can feel like everybody knows your name.
i havent been to this place  in a very long time years ago this was a regular spot i remembered the room was dark food was good and the infamous pole in the ladys room so on a recent cold winter night while melissa  i were trying to figure out where to eat knowing this is her regular spot i said alexander michaels  parking is always a challenge luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street however the darkness is a little creepy i feel like i need a buddy system to park there find a friend hold hands and walk together like we were in grade school  the embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings we got a table very quickly but thats as much service as we got that night there wasnt any incident the waitress wasnt rude but she just wasnt there for a small place like this it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table    the food was ok as well i ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side i forgot the crab soup was made with fake crab which i think should be illegal to be called crab my sandwich had enough meat on it that i pretty much just ate all the meat which was average tender enough not too much taste to it  i guess for  i couldnt complain years later i felt that their menu was limited a little overpriced and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service  i will give it a nd chance and visit again maybe not anytime soon.
from the outside you see a quiet street with some couples strolling along handinhand  as you get closer to the front door you hear a bit of a buzz  is that a bar  whats going on in there  once the door is open you are hit with a wave of laughter glasses clinking and the sound of people talking  i think this is going to work out just fine  the great  the bartenderhostservermanagerbusboy  this guy was friendly funny and helpful  quick to smile and full of insight he is awesome   a great selection of local beers   cool location and extremely cozy inside  the average o  the only food we ordered was a crab soup  which was completely average  with that said this place would be my local watering hole if i lived in the th ward  well done.
