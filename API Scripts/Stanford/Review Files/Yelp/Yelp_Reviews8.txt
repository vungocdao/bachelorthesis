decent drinks  chill atmosphere  irish nachos oh god yes  lack of sketchy people grinding on you  win.
i love watching drunk freshman share the plate of irish nachos absolutely hilarious   burgers are great beers good enough for a campus bar exactly what you expect.
this is one of those places where i only go if someone else really wants to go i always get the same thing a chicken melt with onions and peppers i could make it better but its been reliable i am not an egg person so i guess i am missing out coffee is not good usually crowded and service is passable.
back in cu for the holidaysboy were we disappointed used to love thisplacebut really gone down in quality and service ordered the antipasto which i used to enjoy when frank was therei got a place of lettuce with a few packaged pepperoni and no kalamata olives or any type of olive at allno pepperchoni  dollars and change absolutely terrible pasta was coldservice was slow with few customerswould not be surprised if this  place closed soon if youthink this s the ld manzellaforget itnot as good or even close to what it used to be.
ive never eaten at hardees  ive been to hardees twice once was waaay back in  or so when i went in and ordered some chicken tenders they told me they were out of chicken tenders  so id have to order something else pass ive been avoiding it ever since  yesterday boyfriend and friends wanted hardees i figured it was time to let bygones be bygones so i went to hardees and ordered the threechickentender combo basket with curly fries and a drink the girl behind the counter was efficient but rushed which is kind of what i expect from fast food employees so im not really fazed by that my friends were already seated and served so i filled my beverage and sat with them i made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table as directed  boyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as i sit down this is normal  friend a finishes his burger about five minutes later still no sign of my food  friend b finishes her meal by now its been ten minutes hmm  i notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have finished at this point  i check my receipt its been fifteen minutes my friends need to get back to work i flag down the next passing employee who happens to be the manager i ask him what had happened to my food manager disappears comes back three or so minutes later apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer  and they burned so rest assured they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so  no  i tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund he was sincere and apologetic which i appreciate but at this point i had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food im patient for the most part but there was no offer to comp the meal just hey keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes maybe i understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush but how no one noticed that one order wasnt filled for   minutes just boggles my mind i took the money from my refund and went next door to taco bell where i was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness i really love the taco bell on neil its clean friendly and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome i even make substitutions and deletions to my order and they have never gotten it wrong so the moral of this story in short  save your time and money by skipping hardees and go next door to taco bell.
decent.
mike n mollys is a great time for those looking to enjoy the variety that champaignurbana has to offer the gigs are almost always entertaining and the staff is very responsive and friendly its a nice place to go with a small group of friends and have a few or even dance on saturdays as a college student i think its fantastic for my new friends that mike n mollys lets them in at  because its a real bitch finding other bars that do that.
im a huge fan of the combination bulgogi plate  chicken pork beefall on one plate  im getting hungry for some right now  too bad im two hours awaysigh.
ive been to arirang several times now and i have to say that i am not a fan none of the dishes are particularly great and i would even dare to say that most are vastly bland by korean standards my s korean friend really didnt like the beef bulgogi   being that it takes a very long time to get your food and that finding seats for groups larger than  people is nearly impossible i am not likely to return  there are definitely better korean restaurant in the extreme vicinity.
legendarily lame  this place has managed to successfully wage a campaign against fun for more than a decade tactics include carefully measuring out each shot with a measuring cup while making mixed drinks and charging four dollars above market price for shitty food  going to legends is like having the hot water cut out in the middle of a shower  its like getting your scrotum caught while zipping up your fly  its like watching schindlers list during a bachelor party  its like clogging the toilet at your girlfriends parents house   not fun at all.
love this place who wouldve thought id be reviewing a library  the building is so cool and modern inside so many places to lounge a cafe an outdoor area to chill and the best thing of all for me is that there is a huge play area in the childrens section with toys puzzles and books galore i havent had to buy too many books for my little one shes  now instead i check out  to  books per every  weeks for her to enjoy and they are all usually in good shape plus they have a free baby time class there where we can bring our babies the instructors are so talented they sing and read books to our babies they also bring toys for them to play with my little girl loves it and loves to be with the other babies as well awesome.
this place is the worst  of course its beautiful and has a great selection of booksso long as you dont mind living under the most tyrannical librarian regime ever to live  every time i walk into this library i feel like im walking on eggshells wondering what rule i might break next and god forbid they catch your child with a goldfish cracker in the kids sectionoff with their heads  additionally once it was off limits to savoymahomet residents i felt unwelcome there and totally uncomfortable  i do have a grad student friend who had her feet slightly outside her sandals and got yelled at for it who the hell are these librarians to tell people how they need to sit or wear their shoes  and the childrens librarians are not friendly or nice with the kids but generally seem annoyed that anyone is even there i thought that was the point of a library to excite people about reading and give free access to all  champaign public library which it really isnt anymore is truly the most unfriendly library i have ever been to and i will never go back there again.
better than most chain pizza its ok    we got a thin crust which was nice and crispy only a little greasy ok ingredients not amazing on the cheese and had kind of a bland crust  i guess that doesnt sound too good but i really promise its better than any national chain pizza youll find in town  it also has a really friendly laidback atmosphere.
i went here for their new customer cleaning discount i made the appointment last week i showed up  minutes before my  oclock appointment as requested the front doors were locked no one visible in the office no response to knocking no closed sign or back at clock after pounding on the door in the rain for several minutes before calling the offices phone a person who claimed to work for a sister practice answered confirmed my appointment and put me on hold while he tried to get ahold of someone in the office after several minutes in the rain he told me that he could only reach an answering machine i left  i have never been so grossly disrespected by whats purported to be a business i have never seen such colossal unprofessionalism this business and medical practice does not give a fig about its patientscustomers time judging by the other reviews here i clearly dodged a bullet.
food was great generous portions they piled on the entrees despite the to go box already pretty full good to see didnt see any old lady maybe thats why.
recently i visited a handful of international food stores in champaign il far east market was the most impressive among them their produce selection was incredible a short list includes mangos banannas korean pears luffa eggplant casava clabaza squash lotus root galanga plantain daikon dirion and many more there was a variety of mushrooms they offer very fresh seafood other items that were offered bananna blossom in brine canned jack fruit pickled caggage bamboo shoots quail eggs fried gluten dried lotus seeds and a variety of exotic teas if you are looking for a more authentic selection of fresh foods this is likely your best bet the grocery store is rustic and it almost feels as though you step into an inner city market in another country when you visit far east market they take both checks and cash but do not accept credit.
crust takes almost exactly like cardboard and the toppings are icky  i cant imagine why anyone would order from here  although i did make a second order from here one time  new years eve in fact  but that was only because the cab we had booked never showed up to bring us back home from downtown  so i walked here ordered a pizza to be delivered to my house then tried to make the delivery guy drive me and the pizza  pretty smart huh  too bad they wouldnt let me though  so i canceled the ordered and kept on walking  and walking  and walking  its a long way to east urbana from downtown champaign  in the cold  on new years eve.
i brought my dog in who was very sick and not doing well  they ran a few tests and charged me about a thousand dollars to tell me my dog was old and was going into kidney failure  i am a medical professional i asked if this could possibly be an infection and they said no the dog was just old and had about a month to live  i took the dog to my vet first thing monday morning and the first thing she said was the dog had a good chance of having a serious kidney infection and may respond to treatment  isnt that what i asked  after  days of antibiotic treatment the dog is brand new and back to normal  i cant say enough about my vet she is awesome and thorough  as for animal emergency clinic they are boobery and nothing more  a monkey can start and iv and give fluids i paid huge money for medical management of my dog  i do anesthesia for a living and if i performed this incompetently i would get my ass sued off for sure and i would deserve it  i guess vets have the luxury of never having to live under that ax and they also have the luxury of making a whole lot more money than i do evidently by what they charged  humans dont even get charged this much for simple iv therapy  totally ridiculous take your dog cat parrot whatever to the u of i they are expensive but your pet will be alive when you leave  this place is a joke to the highest magnitude.
god help you when theres a wrestling tournament in town and youre checking out a grad program in cu  no union no historic lincolnyes super   now super  isa super   you are not expecting a bevy of milanese opera singers clad in diaphanous shawls and wet with the last cloying droplets of the spring rain to entertain you with their siren songs in front of the tiny fireplace in the antiseptic lobby  but you arent expecting to see smokingnonsmoking rooms least if youre from california a land where tobacco smoking results in summary execution by armed guardsand being put up in a smoking room is not much of a boon especially when it smells as if the entire room is an ashtray  when i mentioned this to the disinterested yet vaguely friendly guy at the front lobby he pulled his head back from teh phone where he was chattin with his ladyfriend just long enough to query hey you want pops to go up and febreeze that for ya  he then gestured in the general direction of a stooped wizened gentleman wrinkled and neat who looked exhausted  i gulped back shame as i reached for the doorknob to leave  um yeah can you febreeze it    that night it smelled like someone had been smoking in a flowery meadow    the one additional star is for the free wireless in the room  but i felt i had to taste the air so i dont know if it really should get that extra estrella  im so sorry pops  but thanks for the febreezin anyway.
my fiancee and i have been putting off going back to see the university of illinois campus for a while now we saw that super  was having a crazy anniversary sale on rooms where if you booked online on a certain date and time your room would only be  we decided this would be the perfect oppurtunity to head down to champaign so we tried to book the room and got it  this is the point where i tell you if i had paid any more than  i would have felt ripped off the room smelled very weird that smell that makes you think someone could have died in there but they used enough chemicals to kill every last skin cell the bedding was very itchy and the shower curtain didnt even have any plastic liner to keep the water in the tub the only positives the reason it gets two stars instead of one were that there was good pressure in the shower and the location was not bad honestly though unless it is a crazy deal like we had there are better hotels in the area there is even a nicer super  near lincoln avenue.
we ate tonight at nitaya and our food was excellent  i had the pineapple chicken curry and my wife had a modified number   we had potstickers for an appetizer and sticky rice and mango for dessert  the only slight complaint was that the decor was slightly dated but for authentic thai this was it  the service was great and no problems with english understanding him or us.

i just moved my daughter into an apartment for college and stumbled on farrens we had a great burger and ice cold beer after a long drive and move in i had the bacon feta blue cheese burger and it was terrific fries onion rings and chips were all great service was very good thank you farrens.
based purely on service     people  groups   minutes   empty tables   servers   eye contact   acknowledgement to  people waiting to sit  horrible  maybe burgers are good  but i do not like being ignored.
today is st josephs day a day that in italy and many traditional italianamerican households is as special as st patricks day is to the irish and a day rich in food rituals  to mark the occasion i decided that after work i would have a multicourse dinner at one of champaignurbanas italian restaurants  let me first preface my review with some background  i was born and raised in brooklyn ny in a traditional italianamerican household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the sacra tavola or sacred table  i dined in restaurants in little italy and brooklyn where the wait staff was fresh off the boats and barely spoke english and the owners and chefs were all old school italians who had menus often handwritten and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a sense of tradition in the entire dining experience  their tables were often occupied by members of la famiglia but we wont go there  i have no such high expectations from the local eyetalian businesses  anyway i decided upon the great impostor  er impasta  the duecor bordered on tacky with prints of italian posters taped to the sides of the booths  tape  really  service was slow and perfunctory  the meal started with bread olive oil and cheese for the dipping  the oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not parmigiano reggiano  i ordered a glass of the house chianti which was drinkable  for my appetizer i chose the sausage in crust  the sausage was unremarkable and underseasoned and the crust was bone dry  the small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp  my main course was the linguini pescatore described as clams mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini  the mussels were borderline the shrimp decently done and the clams of questionable origin  the sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual fare la scarpetta which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread  the olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can  the linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork  i indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday  as expected no sfinge de san giuseppe a traditional pastry on the menu so i opted for the tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of sambuca   the latter was fine the former was nothing special  perhaps this seems a harsh review  many people may like the eyetalian food offered in cus restaurants likely because that is what they are accustomed to  i like some of the mexican and chinese food here but im sure that mexicans and chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards  so it is with ethnic cuisine  a lot just depends upon what you are used to.
this is place is just horrible they tried to buy my  coach hand purse for  dollars  are you fudging serious the whole store smell so bad and the second hand clothes they well are way too expensive dont sell them your clothes people its just not worth the trip.
clybourne is the best student bar in champaign unlike most of the other campus bars clybourne offers a multifloored facility with plenty of room for sitting drinking and dancing prices are awesome thursdays feature  coronas tuesdays are wine nights where they serve  bottles of wine and champagne sundays my favorite are  youcallits the music is always great and the place is slammed most nights of the week ive hosted lots of parties there and i always get a ridiculous amount of booze for the prices i pay also get a private room.
they seem to have everything obscure films b films foreign films nearly every weird movie ive found out on the internet they have it one time there was some anime i wanted to see but they didnt have but they explained that all the copies out there were pirated and theyd be happy to add it to their collection if i could find a legitimate source for them  secondly its pretty cheap if you buy a renters block  i kind of wish there was a way to return videos without wading into campus though.
its like a portal into a chasm of anime classics world documentary and varied films and cartoons for champaign these guys really have an outstanding collection of rare films  what prevents me from giving it  starts is their stupid rule that you must have a special card and meet special requirements to rent a film from them including being over  for any film.
granted its a dive campus bar but been frequenting them for half price burgers on tuesday food was pretty good loved the mac and cheese as an upgrade however todays visit had a special friend attend with us spotted a cockroach crawling on the wall so much for the green health inspection sign on the door needless to say we wont be back anytime soon.
i lived here my freshman year and it definitely wasnt my favorite  the rooms are big so at first bromley felt like a good deal  however i quickly learned that the walls are thin probably just two sheets of drywall and you can hear every sound from the room next door  even on weeknights students often yelled and ran through the halls at  or  am    as an engineer i had  calculus most mornings  so i found it impossible to get much sleep and i often found myself sleeping in friends apartments instead  if your goal is to party constantly this is your dorm  if youre interested in getting some sleep bromley hall is not your best bet.
meh if i have to choose between chipotle and qdoba i would choose the former both places have ample seating area but when it comes to the taste chipotle is far more superior do yourself a favor and get something better.
seeing how little went into my quesadilla im not comfortable with paying over  at least use a mixed cheese blend  and seeing how little effort went into making my quesadilla i am really not impressed you would think a labor charge is rolled into the price of food  maybe what distinguishes qdoba are the burritos with their special combos but i am nonplussed to try them again oh well.
the food was okay but some of the staff are very rude and uncourteous i had a very unpleasant encounter during lunch time once when the person serving the food demanded a better tip from me when i was leaving the restaurant i had actually tipped him fairly well and i think it is very unprofessional to vocally demand for more money even otherwise he did not seem to care that i was a regular at the restaurant before this incident and i have decided never to visit the place again.
i used to think it was a onestar at first i loved the outdoor seating still do the decent beers and the average but very cheap food i hated that as a gay couple we felt really weird with all the drunk  somethings disapproving and some strange looks from staff however things seem to have changed in that regard and we havent had any adverse experiences in the last  months yeay.
coming from california these are the cheapest drinks ive ever encountered we called ahead of time to ask them to play the niners game even though the bears  packers were the favored game of the day and time they had a tv set up all ready with the niners game when i got there  there are peanut shells all over the ground which i find a little tacky and dangerous the pizza was pretty decent  thin crust we ordered the hawaiian although we substituted bbq sauce for regular pizza tomato sauce  there are fun pool tables and other arcade games a jukebox for your favorite tunes can be found near the bar i think  this place seems to be a staple of downtown champaign.
excellent service they were very busy so the food was slow but they kept our mouths entertained with free bread and appetizers of course it is pricey but it is worth it food was excellent.
the good i liked the decor  it was very pretty the soup of the day was red peppergoat cheese  i could eat that every single day forever and be very happy extensive beer wine and cocktail list the boy said that his curried shrimp was light and pretty good  the bad the waiter was not friendly  he wasnt mean or bad at his job but there was no smile  ever the place is separated into two parts the bartapas area and the dinner area  the two sides allegedly do not communicate   you cant get anything from the tapas menu in the dinner side and viceversa  our suspicions were confirmed when we heard a waiter telling a customer that no he couldnt have the tapa of the day because he didnt even know what it was  what the f  why i had the korean hot pot  i was warned that it was spicy which it wasnt  it was extremely sweet  so much so that i had to stop eating by the time i reached the bottom layer of rice  it was like a half cup of brown sugar had been lacquered all over the rice  blech  the ugly i got food poisoning  thank you korean hot pot  my guts are still kvetching about you  the problem is they had so much deliciouslooking stuff on the menu that food poisoning aside ill still probably go back  if i come out unscathed next time well see about upping the score  really a   wouldve been perfect.
some restaurants in this area have chicagoenvy  that must be the problem with radio maria  the fusion menu doesnt work because the chef has not mastered the basic cuisines that they are trying to blend  dishes are overly complex and are either bland or actively taste bad    the staff used to describe it as a caribbeanpolish fusion  really  i have no idea whats going on now  spanishkorean  soul food middle eastern style  masa boats frog legs ground coffee rubs pad thai torta   the motto seems to be  when in doubt add more things that dont go together none of it done well  this could only be mistaken for sophistication by people who have never been anywhere sophisticated  stay away.
the sangria here is awful i think it was a tequila sunrise the food is greasy and not in a good way the only thing good was the goat cheese but it is goat cheese how can you mess that up.
radio maria is trying a little too hard to be trendy duecorwiseits the kind of place you walk into and expect to be treated with a bit of a condescending attitude by the staff but thankfully this was not the case we made our way to the bar where we were greeted by a friendly barman who presented us with a very nice cocktail list while we waited for a table i chose the dark and stormy which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it i ended up having another that i really didnt need just because it was so refreshingly awesome unfortunately radio marias website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that i went here on a trip out to des moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average id definitely return here on a trip to the twin city area.
i have always enjoyed myself here ive dined and drank and drank and drank  a few highlights of radio are  their absinthe service which is quite a production i dont feel like i can really do it justice by describing it but you will not be disappointed if you order up a couple absinthe drinks  they offer the wheel which is a  oz shot of each of their beers on tap they have about  beers on tap and many are the darker craft ales which in addition to being really tasty are higher in proof you need a couple of people to do this right and there are some rules but if you are already planning on cabbing it home this is a great way to learn about beer and get drunked  their kitchen stays open all night nuff said  radio is one of the very best places to sit outside on a nice summer night get a table at dusk put your back to the window and watch the night unfold.
i love this place  my friends and i try to have a girls night out once a month and we frequent radio maria because of the delicious cuisine and the atmosphere  it is relaxing and has several conversation pieces  the service is spectacular  this is one of my favorite local spots to dine in champaign.
love it  i have been comming here with the rents since i was little so its nostolgic for me  i still get the same thing a scoop of lemon on top of a scoop of chocolate in a waffle cone.
so dominos is dominos right  you must know what you are gettingi dont have to tell you the pizza breadsticks chicken strips pretty good in terms of getting what you pay for  however this location gets the unfortunate privilege  of being my neighborhood locations less than a mile from my house and although this location has been prompt and delicious this is more a review about the man himself mr domino and my online ordering experiences with him  my friends why would you spend  on a dominos pizza when papa johns will give it to you for   not to say im a broke hobo but seriously the difference in cost is a draft beer at a classy joint and  at the places i frequent  my biggest irk with dominos is that they advertise  any speciality pizza and if you change  item say you dont like mushrooms not saying thats me could be not saying and trade for something like black olives even trade no  sometimes i even end up with less on the pizza because i dont like meats all that much and substitute veggies  so if you change  item instead of their  advertised special all of a sudden the price is    for some fin black olives  seriously  i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed  about the rd time this happened i finally put my foot down and looked up papa johns website   any pizza up to  toppings any toppings  pretty much my bff  pjs  go for it.
the staff was so rude st door guy said we could come in for free anytime fri night we came back about  min later different door guy and some old ladies who would not let us in said we had to each pay  the place was ghetto and empty we went back to bar smith next door who had much nicer staff no cover great drinks  drink prices and awesome music sorry sky lounge you suck.
two words overpriced and understaffed  im not sure if palazzo is always open sometimes or just recently reopened but theyve brought back the goth night one friday a month just to clarifynot reviewing that particular dance night just the establishment itself   every time i have been the bar has been understaffed two for an entire nightclub that is packed how does that work it takes forever to get a drink and then its just generally expensive no matter what you get theres also a back bar that seems to never be in use with the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night youd think theyd hire a few extra people   also maybe invest in some misters for your back barit gets ridiculously hot back there when its packed full of people its almost as if this is a bare bones establishment its sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that its at which used to be tranzylvania back in the day just plain sucks.
we recently took our mercedes to virginia auto service for  a new set of tires since we purchased the vehicle there has been a vibration in the rear of the vehicle we have taken it to several places including the dealer to have it repaired to no avail when matt balanced the tires on his new machine that simulated road force the problem totally dissapeared i guess it pays to go to the shops with the most high tech equipment thanks guys.
great food and generally good service lunch time can turn into a loong wait but its always worth it green curry mmmmmmmmmmm.
this place was highly recommended by our friends and we were hoping to also like it first off i called and asked if i could bring a small birthday cake for my husbands birthday the lady on the phone said it was not an issue we got there and it was packed on a friday night the hostess said it would be  minutes for a table literally two seconds later there was a four person table cleared i asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us the place was busy and noisy  the menu was limited and average priced for most items i craved noodles so ordered the padseiw the noodles were alright somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower the hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice  later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us  dollars for bringing our own cake nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us  so sadly we will not be returning thai rama has much better food and service.
i recently frequented wild thaiger on a whim based mostly on other yelp reviews and convenience of location i was very pleasantly surprised  although the exterior of the building isnt very nice the patio seating was perfect for this spring day with protection from the sun a casual ambiance and attentive wait staff  the menu is pretty typical although they indicate gluten free items which is very rare for thai restaurants this is super cool and much appreciated as its more difficult for me to intuit ingredients in ethnic cooking  the vegetarian tom ka was brilliant and our curry dish was one of my husbands favorites ever we didnt try any other menu items  i didnt experience the scene inside we were dining on a weekday for lunch so i cant speak to that  all in all a great experience.
wow what a great flavor for the dishes we had it was nearly impossible to stop eating even after our belly was completely full the waiter was really great as well knew the food and had been there since the place opened he gave is great recommendations all super delish it was a really positive experience we will go back.
we spent  minutes here tonight waiting to be sat only to walk out  we were told it would be about  mins we waited patiently at the hostess stand while a seemingly harried and unorganized staff ran around between the indoor and outdoor spaces various tables were empty and not being bussed and another table was actually cleaned and ready no clue what was going onthere was no one at the hostess stand no apparent leader to be seen   hoping it was just an off nightwhen i return to give them a second chance i still update my review.
fritter me timbers   i mean corn fritters   not that this one little review makes any difference but if you go get the corn fritters   this was my second time at wild thaiger and how that delicious app eluded me the first time i will never know   not the biggest fan of their pad thai but thats okay there are many other very delicious options and corn fritters.
a pool table reminiscent of a bye gone era best cut ive had in years thanks omar.
wow i have been going to this practice for  years i have had some troubles with them in the past but this is the kicker of them all i just called and explained to the person at the front desk that i have been having some breast pain and didnt know if i should come in earlier than my oct st  well woman exam her response was well if you come in early you will have to pay for an office visit i said well if i wait ill just talk to her about it at my well woman her reply if you talk to her about it then then you will be charged extra my reply just for talking about it her reply yup i dont know what to tell you just go to your primary care physician i then explained to her that this was a gynecological issue no response her overall tone was brash rude and short did i mention uncaring  unbelievable never ever have i been so appalled a woman calls and says she has breast pain and isnt sure if she should come in and this is how the front desk responds im outraged and waiting for someone to call me back from the office i think dr johnstone has the right to know how the front desk is treating her patients.
can i give this  stars i guess not bottom line there are no vegetarian options the produce is really bad the line was ridiculously long because there was only one cashier in the entire store i am so disappointed in this safeway and will not return.
i was a little nervous about shopping here after reading the reviews but since it was closest to our hotel we gave it a try  it was fine nothing worse than youd find in the sf bay area buck up little campers quit being so stuck up.
my review is for the bakery  did you know safeway has a delicious carrot cake  i ordered a half sheet for an office function  i arrive at safeway and the cake is not ready  the lady who took my order failed to write down what kind of cake i wanted minus the onestar  the young woman who ended up helping me was very concerned and apologetic  she was able to decorate a carrot cake for me farily quickly and did a wonderful job  very refreshing to see that some people still take pride in doing a good job.
oh for the love of god this place is boring pottery and pictures of pottery   i came here for some tour a few years ago i was so bored i went outside and took a nap next to giant flower pot then i came back here last month for a charity event and also took a nap this time in the bathroom  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
i stumbled across this museum while on the way to pam with a few hours to kill before our flights my friend and i decided to stop here instead  it was a great find and i learned so much unfortunately i hadnt learned very much about native american culture or art in school but i felt like my visit to the heard made up for that a little we had an excellent tour guide who was part navajo and part hopi in addition to giving us a broad overview of native american history he also gave us many insights into growing up on a reservation and cultural traditions as we toured through the galleries filled with basketry ceramics and navajo blankets he explained that a lot of the names given to the tribes by white settlers were simply the result of the two groups not understanding one another for instance the pima tribe is so called because in response to the question what are you called the people answered pima which means i dont knowas in i dont know what you crazy people are asking me  my friend and i had a wonderful time and i would definitely recommend visiting if youre ever in phoenix.
typically im not a huge fan of artifact and cultural exhibits  however the heard experience was beyond expectations   the  student price was reasonable and we were instantly put on a walking tour around the museum the guides were excellent and the museum is quite historic     the contemporary art pieces are not quite art museum worthy  however the katina doll collection was awesome  they have barry goldwaters personal collection of katina dolls on display     i highly suggest using the guided tours  because some of the exhibits are difficult to process.
wife and i had the opportunity to attend a yelp event  the show was called circus americana seating was great dont believe there is a bad seat in the theater staff was very nice bathrooms very clean parking is just across the street would like to come back and see other performances.
an arizona elite institution  high academic and artistic standards quite challenging for students teachers are unusually highly communicative.
i cant seem to understand why many people rate this as a firstclass sports bar because in actuality its one of the worst ive ever been in and i grew up going to the sports books in juarez mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the tv onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day  yes majerles is worse    okay well no one in thunder dans is gonna devour your soul but the place makes me feel like im sharing a pint with florentines catello di rosso gianfigliazzi and ciappo ubriachi in dantes inner ring of the seventh circle of hell  the set up is terrible  the tvs are difficult to see from everywhere in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to two screens  at one time they are both showing the same game  this is a problem during major events like the ncaa tournament or bowl games    moreover i would be kittenhearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game id rather watch    the bar is always crowded which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food  i wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at sports illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top  sports bars in the us.
i really want to love this place but i cant the fries are great the servers attractive and the food gets there fast but the entrees arent that great bottle beer is  that much for a miller lite at a sports bar really and the servers for whatever stupid dumbass reason refuse to split checks  this does nothing but piss me off ive never understood this practice first of all youre a sports bar people genuinely come into sports bars in groups we all ordered food we all ordered drinks and it took nearly  minutes to figure out our goddamn bill at the end  attention restaurant owners most of us dont carry cash anymore get with it and start splitting checks or train your servers to do that with large groups there is no reason to make things more difficult for customers and servers will get better tips.
watched game  of the world series here and had a great time typical bar food but excellent service and let us take our time checked in with us regularly but not too pushy either.
huge disappointment stopped for a quick dinner before a show ordered  burgers medium they came out extremely well done  the buns were hard  dry the waitress took them back to the kitchen  returned with  more well done burgers what the heck when we told her  showed her she apologized  took  off the bill we didnt have time for round  they didnt even send a manager over  for an inedible meal we will not be back id recommend trying somewhere else.
first time at majerles with three others we went before the rattlers playoff game but after a dbacks game so it was really hopping in there got seated right away though   we were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant it lengthened our service time considerably  our daughter ordered the salad special it had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing her husband got the rojo diablo sandwich he said it was stringy and didnt finish it my wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a lettuce bun she got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce i got the allstar burger it was good but overcooked by two levels   the fries and sweet potato fries were good as was the selection of drinks all told for three sandwiches a salad and six beers it totaled  too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location   thunder dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews i may not be back.
another dismal review for this company i called for a  am pickup to the airport like i had several times previously dispatch informed someone would arrive i waited until  am and called againdispatch then told me another  minutes until pickup i stated that was not acceptable as i had a flight to catch i ended up driving myself to the airport oh yeah the driver called as boarding for my plane started.
i booked a stay at hotel san carlos for one night through groupon for  after taxes most other hotels in the area go for  so finding this deal was awesome my boyfriend and i live in az and he wanted to celebrate his birthday by having a staycation downtown so we could have fun with family and friends without worrying about a way to get home at the end of the night originally we were going to book a night at hotel palomar but like i said we werent looking to spend a lot of money  i started reading reviews before we checked in and was feeling nervous that i hadnt made a good decision because there were more bad than good things being said from the moment we got to the hotel to the time we checked out our stay was anything from dissappointing the staff was nice and let us check in early before we parked we talked to the valet service and asked for advice on parking they could have given us excuses to use their service but instead they pointed across the street and let us know that on the weekends parking in those spots were free awesome free parking   once we got to our room everything was clean and the room was a nice temperature the rooms are small and the bathroom is even smaller but i didnt expect anything else its a little ridiculous how many people complained about the raised up part of the floor you have to step over to get in the shower wahhh i barely noticed it and anyone with a brain should have no problems stepping over it also the shower does fluctuate in temperature when someone flushes a toilet but it was never an unbearable cold or heat once we got settled in we went to the pool its a cute little pool but by the time we got out there the sun was covered by the building surrounding it so that was a bummer   for lunch we went next door to mccafferys they have great food and our bartender was great   honestly i have no complaints about our stay its a cute little hotel and for staying on a saturday night there were no dramatic noises going on and i didnt hear anyone talking in another room having sex or going to the bathroom i heard a couple of door slams but i think at any hotel its typical all the bad reviews are obviously from people who have a case of first world problems wahhh no room service wahhh the rooms are too small wahhh i couldnt control the room temperature wahhh theres something i have to lift my foot up  inches from the ground to get over in to the shower wahhh  wahhh  wahhh  get over it people take your spoiled attitudes over to the hyatt.
i have been going to this ihop every month for  years our group is anywhere from  to  there are only two places in the restaurant that accommodate groups and for the most part we have been seated relatively quickly over the past year service has gone down hill it started taking forever to get our order taken get our drinks or get our food we are a very forgiving bunch and know its not easy to serve a large group but as service started really sliding our last trip ended the relationship we had about  people and knew we would have to wait a bit but after  minutes we inquired how long and it was like your waiting for a tablethe kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups how can you not remember a group when they take up the whole lobby we called a near by breakfast place and they were thrilled to have our party which grew smaller since some left at that point we found a new home and they will get  stars on my review.
what can i say about comedor that hasnt already been said the food is reasonably priced and the selection is huge back in the day before i started telecommuting a margarita or beer paired with one of their daily specials have gotten me through more than one long assed afternoon at work please dont tell my boss  the wait staff is incredibly nice and watching newbies squint under the bright lights and bad south of the boarder art is always entertaining  if you want to be a little bold try one of their soups they are scarrier than shit if you are a white girl that grew up on meat and potatoes but they taste great i just dont ask whats in it lol.
yum this place is yummy it is my favorite authentic mexican restaurant to take outoftowners to the doormansecurity guard is so sweet and makes sure you dont get shot and that your car is there after your meal the surrounding area is a bit tough and i dont suggest wandering far from the parking lot if you know what i mean the somewhat scary location makes everything a bit more authentic in my eyes  i made the mistake of ordering chicken once and i was disappointed not sure why  maybe it is because they dont use all white meat chicken or maybe it was an off day or maybe i just dont like their chicken i dont know but now i stick with beef or cheese based items and everything i get is super delish love the beans they do em right margaritas are freshly made and full of alcohol not like the watered down versions you get from a stupid machine at other places gotta love the free chips and salsa  the salsa always tastes fresh and theyll give you a superspicy version if you ask and they keep em coming even after dinner if you want more  try the carne asada cheese crisp as an appetizer  it is huge but so good that if you have more than  people at your table you should order two if you dont someones going to wish they had gotten more.
met some friends here for a birthday dinner place was packed i was drinking but the rest of my group enjoyed the cocktails  three of us split a mixed grill plate had enough for four as opposed to three we opted for carne asada carnitas and chicken everything was prepared well and was quite tasty.
over rated and to crowded  go to mi patio or la canasta instead  or go a little further north to via delosantos for even better food and drinks.
last night was my first time in the little theater which is part of phoenix theater  i didnt see it on the list so im reviewing it here   we saw reefer madness the musical  it was awesome  i couldnt stop laughing  the sound of the theater was excellent   it was definitely small and the seats very uncomfortable  they had snacks out during intermission  we bought two water bottles and i was happy to see them put a box out for recycling the water bottles and the soda cans  they also had a box out for recycling the programs once the play finished   i will definitely see another play here.
i went to see in the wake of bounty part of fringe fest  and besides the show being exquisite the venue was perfect  phoenix little theatre is basically attached to the phoenix art museum which means you can stroll about in the little park area before the show take goofy pictures with the headless children statues and throw wishing pennies into the fountain overlooked by the uber masculine yet pensive sculpture     free and plentiful parking  the theatre is really intimate with a small stage and limited seating with that being said any seat would give a great view of the happenings on stage  only downside is that the theatre chairs and my rear end did not get along amiably  lots of fidgeting on my part and constant readjusting.
what i love about yelp is that you will find hole in the wall spots that you would never try if not for the nearby search and prior reviewers telling you its okay try it  the grilled chicken burrito i had was delicious what makes their burritos is the tortilla  their tortillas are the best ive had in a long time add the great salsa bar small but fresh and you have a great local neighborhood gem  i would warn that my burrito was chuck full of grilled dark meat which i love but isnt for everyone  the smoky flavor from the grill makes the chicken extra flavorful  it also had delicious mexican rice  just enough melted cheese  their salsa was so good i finished every chip  this place would be compared to a locally owned baja fresh but so much better ingredients and true mexican flare right down to the mariachi music being piped in  you order at the counter and listen for your number to be called  the staff is great and constantly milling around clearing and cleaning tables  thanks chicos ill be back.
awful  gross  disappointing  a coworker and i werent in the mood for subway mcdonalds or einsteins so we decided to try chicos tacos  a place id driven by many times but hadnt tried before  the items on the menu looked decent enough and i settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go  i got back to work and settled in to try my meal  the tacos were actually not in preformed taco shells but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried  sadly there was hardly any meat in either and most of each taco was the shell  they had good flavor but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam plate below sort of ruined them  the beans and ride were both inedible  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor with a layer or congealed cheese over the top  the rice was mushy and bland except for the topmost layer which was overseasoned with cumin  i was given a small bag of tortilla chips and those were passable  including a large fountain drink i paid   i wont be back especially when theres a filibertos just down the road.
this place is really great for teriyaki  in fact it is really the only place worth going for teriyaki  first of all  it is really very inexpensive lunch for two under   easily second of all  the service is great because it is family run  you see the same people there everytime  the food is really good  and just hits the spot when you have a hankering for teriyaki  my only complaint would be the hours bums me out when i want teriyaki for dinner and they are already closed.
i stopped in one day when i first moved here and sampled a couple of things the chicken teriyaki the fried gyoza and some kind of drink nothing was fresh everything tasted like old fryer grease or freezerburn except my drink to their credit the service was immaculate the women who helped me was super friendly and made suggestions of things i should try on my next visit when pigs fly i am really amazed by the positive reviews here unfortunately this place is just a couple blocks from my house so i have to deal with the nasty stench from their deep fryer when i walk to the lightrail on my way to work.
i avoid this place  they play extrememly loud music on saturday nights till am i will not go there until they change their practices.
i have been here multiple times for all facets of dinning including lunch dinner drinks late night bites and a corporate function and everytime ive liked it it is one of my favorite places to go before a baseball or basketball game they have a great selection of handcrafed beers both on tap and in bottles there food is also really good for what i take as more of a bar enviornment there burgers sandwiches and pastas are all well executed and have a gourmet flair with resonable prices the lobster bisque is fantastic and so are the salads and appetizers they have a great patio downstairs and a balcony where you can eat and drink outside upstairs too check this place out it is more than worth the visit and they have good happy hour and reverse happy hour specials.
i really wanted to like this place i live nearby and i love the downtown area i want all the places here to be  star joints but my partner and i showed up on a sunday afternoon with only a halfdozen people in the place and just as many waitresses and they still took  minutes to deliver our food we watched our waitress eat her lunch at the bar and then when our food came it wasnt right  we ordered a sandwich that was piled high with turkey one bite however and we knew our bread was more than dayold i actually had to ask them if it was toasted it wasnt because it was just as hard and dry as a piece of toasted bread back it went  the pizza which i ordered because of the kalamata olives their mediteranean was missing kalamata olives thats right  its the major ingredient on the pie and the joker in the kitchen forgot to put them on   never mind after  minutes youll eat anything beer was overpriced at  for a glass we got out of there as quickly as we could after the food was consumed wont be back.
the lobster bisque is amazing i do agree however anything above and beyond the bar takes acts of congress to get right the server took it upon himself to assume i wanted a side portion instead of a dinner portion of a salad at dinner time weird it takes forever to get another beer heaven forbid your thirsty on a bad day lastly by the time my husband was able to grab the attention of said server for katsup and mustard his burger it was cold and my salad had yet to arrive hence the extra time to sip on my late beer waiting for dinner i would say there are better more collected establishments in the area wait as i hear the second ring from the kitchen for the salad that i can see from the window but can not have .
ive hesitated to write about fate i always enjoyed the food and experience at the owners old lucky dragon even back when it was on university i also appreciate the fact that fate is a downtown pioneer and that one can eat there after   weve been to fate a number of times with vaguely disappointing results after this visit  weve had it   im not really high on the this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time style of user review so let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits yet never all at once fate however put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco   i dont know if fates policy is to have the hostesshost inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes but the math doesnt work out the place is tiny we waited forty minutes the next group waited fiftyfive minutes the next few groups are probably still waiting their oncevital bodies deteriorating into skeletons  the server dropped off some menus mentioned that she was going to bring us some water and then vanished as if she were an illusionists assistant again fate is tiny so the trick was pretty difficult  anyway we ordered after she rematerialized after the required fifteen minutes stuff arrived it was the old joke  the food here is terrible and such small portions  ill spare most of the hideous details but one lowlight to share involved the sesameshrimpsalad item im hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightlyoff fish sauce rather than some slightlyoff shrimp actually why do i care we felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash our cat still wouldnt come near us   anyway i dont mean to imply that the owner and staff at fate are malicious the food isnt good enough and the experience isnt good enough oh if youre uncomfortable with ikea furnishings im fine dont even try it.
i want to like fate but i just dont they cater to my vegan cravings so how bad can it be but i just get a really shitty vibe when i walk in like its sooo annoying that i want to eat there this could all be in my head i think everyone should try it for themselves   that said whats not in my head is the pricing structure of their drinks next door holy mother of chicken christmas and rice those are some pricey fuckin drinks the ambiance is cool but it doesnt justify it not to this wretched skanks soul.
i wont be back here again  ever    can one give less that  star   it is a bummer as i used to frequent this place as it is conveniently located for me  pamela the bartender is a sweetheart and works hard to recognize people by name   personalized service like hers helped me to overlook issues like the significant cleanliness challenges that are easy to spot if you look around   if you think i am joking go into the bar and look up a the light fixtures   that fuzzy stuff is probably  years of dust  carpets are dingy and smells like old beer  this place rocks as a nightclub on weekends i dont think that cleanliness is the priorityanyhowi spent a lot of money there over the years mainly for lunch or after work cocktails with friends  never more not because of the issues outlined above but it is beacuse how i was treated when visiting the establishment not long ago   pamela was not working that day sadly and the male bartender decided that he was more interested in lecturing me on his beliefs than he was in serving my drinks and taking my money  he had an issue and apparently i was the target and cause of his rantings   he was sad about the lack of customers and decided it was my fault as i mentioned i worked downtown   his rants about downtown businesses was unorthodox and uncalled for   i drank my beer and hurried out reminding myself never to set foot in the place again  no wonder they are lacking for customers    there are more and more restaurants downtown  time to step it up or get out of the way matador.
dined with a good friend of mine while in town so the slowish service was no bother actually we had good service they were on top of my need for water with lots of ice  lisa had the chile rellanos and she said they were good the portion was large and she took about half home  i got the chimichanga it was a delight the meat was done perfectly and was very flavorful and not at all bland usually my rice goes uneaten but this rice was about the best mexican rice ive ever had the beans were as i like the.
tried this place for lunch had the chicken burro and have to agree with the other reviewers i wouldnt recommend matador and am still baffled that it was packed at lunchtime.
service was not good they forgot about us after our dinner was served chips tasted stale.
this review is not a review of the store but of att wireless service in general  att is the worst wireless service ive ever had  i have more dropped calls and less bars in more places than any other carrier ive had and ive had verizon tmobile the best and now att  i would have never switched service if i didnt have to in order to get my iphone  and for the record  the iphone is the best object ive ever owned  i recommend you avoid att wireless at all costs unless you want the best phone in the world only then is it worth it.
my friend and i stopped here for a light dinner before going to a movie at the amc theater in the same plaza not sure why we picked this place i think we just both realized we were kinda hungry after wed already parked and walked in   mi amigos was never really on my radar as a place to try im more a fan of the holeinthewall real mexican food place this place kinda felt like a mexicanthemed or mexicaninspired restaurant but it lacked something almost felt like a food court with table service   the food was fine it wasnt bad the service was fine   my friend had the shrimp and garlic platter and enjoyed it i had a small tortilla soup we probably overdid it with the chips and salsa and even those were just fine i would have liked for someone to just leave a pitcher of water no ice on the table because it felt like an eternity between refills and each refill succeeded in mostly adding more ice to my glass no bueno  no dessert no drinks wasnt really feelin it  i wouldnt say im jumping at the chance to eat here again its serviceable if i find myself at the az center and other people want to eat here i will do my best to make suggestions to go elsewhere but i wont encourage it but i wont fight it if the majority rules.
this place is an embarrassment to mexican restaurants the food here is terrible heres what we ordered combo tacoenchilada  oily taco diarrhea enchilada  green chilie burrito  the tortilla was plastic and the filling was gross taco salad  bunch of stuff with zero taste should have grazed in the planter the beans and rice really they couldnt even get that right under cooked bland rice and under cooked beans this place sux beer is good.
heading to catch a flick at the arizona center decided to checked out mi amigos to start with it took about  minutes before anyone bother to talk to us once we did get to order we opted to share the tortilla soup and the chicken fajitas the tortilla soup was really bad it tasted like a mix of chili powder and salt we ended up sending it back the chicken fajitas were actually ok but not great   the real downer was the service waitstaff appeared to be fairly apathetic about the place limited interested in actually taking our order bringing out food etc  overall there are much better choices you should look elsewhere if you are hungry for mexican food.
staying as airline crew at the sheraton hotel across the street i asked the front desk person to recommend me a good mexican restaurant  he recommended the canyon cafue which is in the same exact mallmovie complex as this place mi amigos    i reviewed the canyon cafues menu and didnt care for it since its more of a fusion restaurant not real mexican food  i told the hostess that i wanted more authentic food and she told me to try mi amigos  i walked  feet to this place  i have to say the server was a sweetheartvery friendly welcoming  thats the only thing i liked about this place aside from the cadillac margarita for   i ordered the tortilla soup  okis.
if youre on a budget this place is probably  star however its not for me its very bland not something id expect from a mexican restaurant.
went here just before a movie the service was fast but thats it i ordered the mango and shrimp quesadilla my friend ordered nachos the food was not good i and my friend could not finish our food and we had stomach aches immediately after.
my boyfriend and i ended up getting food poisoning  i was extremely disappointed because the location is near our condo and the staff was so friendly  i think we are going to the emergency room.
