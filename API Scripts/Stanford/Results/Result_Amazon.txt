my lovely pat has one of the great voices of her generation i have listened to this cd for years and i still love it when im in a good mood it makes me feel better a bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain this cd just oozes life vocals are jusat stuunning and lyrics just kill one of lifes hidden gems this is a desert isle cd in my book why she never made it big is just beyond me everytime i play this no matter black white young old male female everybody says one thing who was that singing .
  Positive
despite the fact that i have only played a small portion of the game the music i heard plus the connection to chrono trigger which was great as well led me to purchase the soundtrack and it remains one of my favorite albums there is an incredible mix of fun epic and emotional songs those sad and beautiful tracks i especially like as theres not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks i must admit that one of the songs lifea distant promise has brought tears to my eyes on many occasionsmy one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs which i find distracting but even if those werent included i would still consider the collection worth it.
  Negative
i bought this charger in jul  and it worked ok for a while the design is nice and convenient however after about a year the batteries would not hold a charge might as well just get alkaline disposables or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.
  Negative
check out maha energys website their powerex mhcf charger works in  minutes for rapid charge with option for slower charge better for batteries and they have  mah batteries.
  Negative
reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines i am weaning off my vhs collection but dont want to replace them with dvds this unit is well built easy to setup and resolution and special effects no progressive scan for hdtv owners suitable for many people looking for a versatile productcons no universal remote.
  Negative
i also began having the incorrect disc problems that ive read about on here the vcr still works but hte dvd side is useless i understand that dvd players sometimes just quit on you but after not even one year to me thats a sign on bad quality im giving up jvc after this as well im sticking to sony or giving another brand a shot.
  Negative
i love the style of this but after a couple years the dvd is giving me problems it doesnt even work anymore and i use my broken ps now i wouldnt recommend this im just going to upgrade to a recorder now i wish it would work but i guess im giving up on jvc i really did like this one before it stopped working the dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.
  Very negative
i cannot scroll through a dvd menu that is set up vertically the triangle keys will only select horizontally so i cannot select anything on most dvds besides play no special features no language select nothing just play.
  Negative
exotic tales of the orient from the s dr shen fu a weird tales magazine reprint is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price if youre tired of modern authors who all sound alike this is the antidote for you owens palette is loaded with splashes of chinese and japanese colours marvelous.
  Negative
firstlyi enjoyed the format and tone of the book how the author addressed the reader however i did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal if you are just starting to research law school and do not know all the requirements of admission then this book may be a tremendous help if you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions i recommend some more topicspecific books for example books on how to write your personal statment books geared specifically towards lsat preparation powerscore books were the most helpful for me and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation yet for those new to the entire affair this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.
  Negative
i currently live in europe and this is the book i recommend for my visitors it covers many countries colour pictures and is a nice starter for before you go and once you are there.
  Positive
if you want to listen to el duke  then it is better if you have access to his showerthis is not him it is a gimmickvery well orchestrated.
  Positive
this game requires quicktime  to workif you have a better version of quicktime i have  it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the cdif you click no it will not let you play so i begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try and it installed quicktime  then it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc it kept telling me that even after i uninstalled my version of quicktime  and reinstalled barbie rapunzel and quicktime  very frustrating and the game absolutely will not work for me it keeps telling me over and over to install quicktime  tho ive been through the installation process repeatedly it is not my operating system limitations this is a brand new computermerely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.
  Negative
i have been using this product for a couple years now i started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers this actualy came in the relaxer kit i tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use i could not find it in any of the stores at the time so i searched amazon and they had it i absolutely love it it is the best moisturizing product i have used so far my hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was i am very happy with it.
  Negative
was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power but it required the adapter to actually work  i sent it back.
  Negative
first of all the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped a week and a half later i received another email telling me that they are sorry but they dont actually have any of these items and if i received an email telling me it has shipped it was a mistakewhen i finally got my money back i went through another company to buy the product and it wont work with my phone even though it depicts that it will i have sent numerous emails to the company  i cant actually find a phone number on their website  and i still have not gotten any kind of response what kind of customer service is that no one will help me with this problem my advice  dont waste your money.
  Negative
this is an awesome game almost everyone know tictactoe so it is easy to learn and quick to play you cant play just once the twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes  just big enough to gobble up your opponent the first person to make tictactoe wins but its not as easy as it looks when youre stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities my  and  year olds will beat me even when im trying to win excellent beginning critical thinking game grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.
  Negative
for the price of  this pc game is well worth it great graphics colorful and lots to do my four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little ones very own parade.
  Positive
this is an excellent album with some great fiddle playing ryan is amazing to watch when he plays in person you can feel the emotion he puts into each song.
  Very positive
ive read this book with much expectation it was very boring all through out the book.
  Negative
this product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so i spent  and havent worn then i wouldnt buy this product again dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
  Negative
the magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that victoria magazine has come to represent i have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day.

  Positive
if you purchase this data cable you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works as directed i downloaded all of the files from the se site mb on dial up and then downloaded all of the user guides everything seemed to install ok but nothing would make my phone be recognized after that i scoured the se site for troubleshooting info on their branded cablein the hope that something would help me figure out the problem after  full days of beating my head against the wall i finally threw the cable and the useless cd that came with it in the trashif i had used my brain i would have paid the extra  for a se branded cable and software and the support that comes along with that i now have the real deal se data cable and software and guess what yep installation was a breeze and it works beautifully you really do get what you pay for.
  Negative
like many of the barbie cd roms the playtime is limited  averaging about  mins for each of my two daughters ages    like the barbie movies and other cd roms the graphics are poorly done.
  Negative
i bought this item to connect to a strobe light unit functions well not sure that it has all the range claimed but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this just too many variables i can say it works from my neighbors house into my garag.
  Negative
i suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have lineofsight with the device lamp etc plugged into this control it might work maybe but i had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit and it was completely unreliableid recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product.
  Positive
ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off ive been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want under my desk shelf etc.
  Negative
very disappointed in this product it worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated it was very inexpensive so i did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction.
  Very negative
this is the all time best book she mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire who knows well anyway i like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush ps i think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world.
  Positive
cant believe i have never reviewed this book before first read this back when i was  like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soulmates which drug me into these books rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
  Negative
lj smith is the best author in the whole world i read this book a year ago but i cant stop reading it it is beyond sweet i love ashthe entire night world seris is the bomb i read mostly everyone of lj smiths book and they all are awesome i think ash and mary lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates i loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldnt there should be real guys like ashquinnjuliundamongabriel and i can go on forever i think everyone should read at least one lj smith book if you do youll be hooked on them for lifelike i am lj smith is the best.
  Negative
this book was so great i loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart i just hope that there is a follow up on this story because i want to know if marylynette and ash get together.
  Positive
apart from it arriving broken the first time my kids are loving this dvd which i alternate with the other i purchased to keep my own sanity this dvd has created a thomas fan out of my   yr old daughter as well.
  Positive
my children get easily bored with this video i thought it was several episodes of thomas but it has a lot of just children and parents talking about thomas and all it doesnt keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking this was my first thomas video purchasehopefully the next will have more shows and less talking.
  Positive
i went online for information about dockers khaki pants the size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores i was very impressed with the selection i had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length the delivery was quick especially during christmas and i really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.
  Negative
merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants so when it was shipped i was charged  again when the second pair was in stock weeks laterwill not buy from amazon vendors again.
  Negative

  Negative
this is a great cd i love weib kreuz the anime is awsome its bout  guys hhhooottt who work at a flower shop but at night they are the white hunters or byce as in the anime they are assasins that hunt the tomorrow of bad guys the bad guys the police cant get  like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason from a strange gas substance that w instant contact ingulfs any object but i couldnt resist its also an emotional anime at times i think this is a cd and anime any anime fan should see.
  Positive
i was looking forward to receiving this book as i was going to new orleans to antoines restaurant i read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy this book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that i could not read it without my eyes watering i sent it back at my own expense and to date i have not had a refund.
  Negative
this book is simply great if you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize html and present its syntax willynilly this book is the only book ive ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup it explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook html with other technologies without trying to teach cgi css etc at the same time the only thing i wish is that this guy would write a javascript or dhtml book id buy that right away.
  Negative
this is a tearjerker mixed with humor a lot of rough patches for this couple but dont let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times too i watch this movie often as i am a hopeless romantic and i thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing hindi style  pop rock mix plus its worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts it ends the way a typical relationship of this type would but thats not exactly a bad thing in this case i recommend it to everyone.
  Negative
love itvery touchits to bad that in the dvd description doesnt mention no subtitles.

  Negative
the reason i gave two stars when i usually give  stars for ms feehans books is bc this book was tooooooo mysterygothic genre rather than romance i really didnt feel like the two main characters were in love in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroines point of view and i was getting sick of her whining and her point of view unlike the dark series you really didnt feel any passion the book is better suited for the mysterygothic genre and not romanceeven the mystery was not that good its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages throughout the entire book youre kept in suspense of who was the bad guy if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pagesms feehan if your reading please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery.
  Negative
i have read all of the carpathian novels to date except one i very much enjoyed them at first but nothing ever gets resolved you would think that after  books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced as for this book it is an offshoot of another carpathian novel about the jaguar line i was hoping to find out more about this curse the origins and why the males kill the females nothing not a word about the jaguar curse and why do the walls and ceilings change ideas introduced and left at that ms feehan went once again off on a tagent her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive i will not be buying any further books by this author what a shame.
  Very negative
we purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship the bag was convenient to carry however the faux leather began peeling at first it wasnt so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes i would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that i had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes.
  Negative
i was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to patricia cornwell well now i cant put her books down her books just get better and better as you go through the kay scarpetta seriesi really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book its nice to see the characters develop through each story line it allows you to get comfortable with them get close to them and get frustrated with them when they do something out of characteri highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire kay scarpetta series.
  Negative
this is an awesome book kay just keeps getting better and better its also fun to see the characters develop more with each book  kay herself as she seems to be always one against the world marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic in this book kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings it appears that a recently executed murderer who kay herself has seen on her autopsy table is still around committing crimes a number of murders occur where the executed murderers fingerprints are turning up kay marino and benton try to track a killer but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere this is a taut and totally believable thriller i cant wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment.
  Positive
parricia corwell cruel  unusual was breathtaking in the beginning her relation to her family her dedication to her work exeptional however this story began to get boring towards the endthe ending not too great.
  Neutral
saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste  agonizing minutes of their lives in a nutshell i have heard many more clever jokes and oneliners watching king of queens on cableseriously folks its that badthe bad jokes and the  references to small jewish penises got old real quick thought i would always be a sandler fan but he clearly adam was in need of some rent money and jumped on this script for the cash and ranwhy else would the plot line include seth rogan writing for him to put things into perspective this film made bruno look like casablanca.
  Negative
i should have known going into this movie having judd apatow a part of it would mean i would hate it however having adam sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a very hopeful chance the movie loses its true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible  crude jokes i have to say we didnt make it more than  minutes into the movie before turning it off it is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior i just dont believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior very disappointing.
  Negative
this has just about everything the rabbi of course is learned and devout even if his schooling causes some nervousness the cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech the visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of smalltowners can summon and around all of that the monotonous drama of life unfolds loves losses and changes that no one knows how to ride outcomics have moved well past the bampow genre into many other idioms  this might border on chick lit but much less than some if reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you with deep family devotions and deeper or shallower personal ones the ragged lines of this comic might touch you wiredweird.
  Negative
this grill is one of its kindit can be use anywhere without so much hard workit fits snugly anywhere.
  Negative
i had never read this author but knew of many who did when i read that this book was being made into a movie it seemed a good opportunity to read her before seeing the screen mess up her work now i pray that the screen does soi was extremely disappointed with this work it is unrealistic fails to capture the reader and at points when i should have been completely engrossed left me struggling with whether i wanted to pick it up i hope she has written better than this or else there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors availableher characters are not sympathetic they do not draw the readers attention and they are dull in overall scope i have too many other good books to read before i pick up another book from this author.
  Neutral
this was a very good book with excellent descriptions its a real page turner and keeps you wondering whats going to happen next the best parts are at the very beggining and the end.
  Positive
my first foray into the novels of patricia cornwell has left me impressed the characters were intense and realistic my only concern is that the evil temple gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning why did he decide to trail and give gifts to dr scarpetta needless to say i will be reading more of cornwells books especially if they are at all like this novel.
  Negative
the publisher said soon to be a movie does anyone know if a movie was ever created.
  Negative
this was only my first cornwell novel and im hooked in the past few months i have managed to collect all of her books and i cant wait to dive into them this summer will be a suspensful one for scarpetta and i.
i have read all of the scarpetta novels  this is not the worst that would be cause of death but rt up there i thought the story began well enough but the ending was lame the plot was predictable lucy is nauseating as ever  wish shed die scarpetta is still overly materialistic  selfrighteous which has gotten oldone of many gripes would be that i find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies  the media have zero knowledge of this serial killers family background close family members  like a twin sistermy advice  dont let this be your st scarpetta novel.
  Very negative
great racquet but im a power hitter i have no power generating difficulty with this racquet my style is to try to volleyball and everything ive found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered i like the factory grip although with distinct ridges others prefer a smooth grip may  give the factory grip on chance and you may come to like it the sale prices are right for a high about end racquet racquets and black knight in have a reputation for overall durability so you should get plenty of use before replacement note i got my first cc as a d level player and did not like it immediately howeve as my game improved version i switched from my bandit black knight cc white racquet to the great success and have had so it might not be the right racquet for a beginner intermediate to advanced players but will benefit from this fine racquet.
  Negative
started laughing in the second chapterenjoyed the book after i realized that i wasnt going to learn anything new its obviously a miracle that we survived for the  years since it was first publishedand seeing that the pending insolvency of the us was as loudly shouted in the s as it is now was worth the price this book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the uskudos to whoever owns the copyright  now theres economics in action.
  Negative
i was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery sure back then there was no google searching nor number crunching laptops but plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent probably the books greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences even with todays analytical resources economists are still all over the map on their predictions  conclusions on the other hand meteorologists seem to do quite wellnaturally the radical libertarians teabaggers  republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence i would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty  irrational.
  Very negative
edith has created a venue for herself to exorcise melancholic memories with painful melodies there are no disguises on this collection lonesome guitars and medicinal piano radiate the mood of broken spirits she writes all her own songs these ballads are definite reminders of those unbearable moments we all have to live they are all gray sky secludedisolating tunes i envision a ironical pace i thought she was from chicago millions and millions of people and she sings stark loneliness.
  Negative
i recently purchased this camera and im very satisfied with it i find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital it is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use i highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price nice going sony.
  Positive
the sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right i am  size   lbs before baby and i gained about  lbs during pregnancy just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies i dont like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like i have back boobs the shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesnt feel smooth all over squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage if you do decide to purchase this product its easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts.
  Positive
i think this product provided a great fit i was able to hook on the first row by myself within about  mins max it wasnt quite as difficult to get on as i thought it might be although it isnt particularly easy either i tried it on and wore for about  hours and then the nd time i wore it had it on for about the same period of time i took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom this product is far too expensive to have something like that happen the fit on me was snug but i am sure i had the correct size now i have to figure out how to get this resolved.
  Negative
i love love love the squeem the before and after pictures are definitely real you can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture you eat much less since it squeezes the hell outta you but its not an uncomfortable squeeze.
  Positive
a friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress i brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but i needed a small it was extremely difficult to put on so i needed assistance once it was on i was still able to contract my core which meant that i needed a smaller size i believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso other then that this is great buy.
  Neutral
i ordered the squeem waist shaper in a size smallmy general size is  im  and weigh lbs right no.
  Negative
the squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best while the product compresses your stomach the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends i have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through at one point the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom it scraped my stomach and i took it off immediately i have never washed the product in the washing machinei have always handwashed it so the manufacturer cant say that i didnt take good care of it.
  Negative
i ordered this product to slim down my stomach i was looking for something i could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses i wore the squeem to work occasionally and then i would take it off when i got home when i would take it off i felt sore around my sides and my back i washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didnt one night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so i ended up keeping the squeem on for about hours instead of my normal  hours that night when i took the squeem off i had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks im blackon my body i read other review before i purchased the squeem and i didnt see anything that alerted me not to buy it not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you dont say i didnt warn you.
  Very negative
i was really unhappy with this i followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size it was way too small at  weeks postpardum im ten weeks postpardum and may try it again but it was a real selfesteem crusher initially im a size  prepregnancy and so i thought it was fair to order the xs but i guess not.
  Negative
my wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size she made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small we have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins thats why she wanted the apparel she was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didnt fit.
  Negative
i have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasnt elastic based found this item and have to say i am pretty pleased the hooks do take a while but once they are all done the waist cincher does what it says it will do the only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about it does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms so i cant wear this with a top that is clingy can only wear with looser fitting shirts oh well nothing is perfect.
  Negative
the author is very likely a kurdish nationalist not implausibly a quite supporter of the pkk as a communist he has no room for religion his analysis is misleading basically he runs after muslims under the banner of islamism he seeks to undermine the islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs the author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that islam does not work the author does not use objective scientific methods he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions read the book if you wish but with such qualifications in mind you may read it to understand how the bigots mind actually works.
  Negative
this novella stretched to  pages by wide margins and doublespaced lines reads like a screenplay treatment there is very little character development movielike dialogue and plenty of mindless action the ending is wholly unsatisfying and im led to believe that this is simply a setup for another book an author with some integrity would have placed edge of danger as part  of a part novelif you are deadset on reading edge of danger dont waste your money the cover price of is an insult and the deeply discounted  price will still leave you feeling rippedoff go to your local library in the morning and youll finish edge of danger in time for an early lunch just dont expect to have any appetite left.
  Very negative
i have read many of jack higgins books and this is the poorest so far in my humble belief as i travelled thro the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which mr dillon strolls thro the events at hand the story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story mr dillon is just to scifi im afraidthere is a quote at the start of the book and as i got near the final chapters i was starting to imagine that the author would be writing the finale of mr dillonthe quote readto tess who thinks its about timeauthor i think she may mean something else.
  Very negative
its got a nice warm scent of vanillalike smell texture is creamy meadow sweet is a nice nude color cant apply too much or else itll look a bit dry.
  Positive
west is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work he has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses.
  Positive
a refreshing sunwarmed beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of ice age europe a delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive the plot line moves in different ways from other woman against the odds novels so it is a fresh and not predictable a very good read and a much better choice over jean auels shelters of stone.
  Very positive
i found it preachy and long and gotvery bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologuethen tried to find theactual novelfinally gave up.
  Negative
the abridged version of this book would read as sosin is inevitable so make the best of bad situations and oh by the way women are strongthere ya go nuff said i dont need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire  odd pages or so of this travesty the entire book is just one big complaint from the girl who commits adultery she laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well painfully thick language stupid storyline quixotic style everything that would piss off a recreational reader avoid it.
  Negative
this book was recommend  me from my neighbor but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book  recommend i didnt like it  much but.
  Negative
i really enjoyed this book it shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake cant go wrong with the classics.
  Positive
this review refers to isbn  with no explanation or indication that it is doing so this edition leaves out the authors introductory chapter the customhouse admittedly the chapter is long tedious and skipped by many still it leaves the book useless for the classroom and lets face it who else is going to read it this isnt exactly light summer readingin addition there is no bolding of sat words with definitions in the margins that some reviewers mention which was the main reason i chose this edition in fact other than the abbreviated text there is absolutely nothing no forward no readers guide no author bio  nothing so not the most helpful textbookon the bright side it is wellbound and the type is quite easy to readi am returning the book and looking for a more suitable edition.
  Negative
the creepiest book ive ever read its a creepy mysteryromance all in one creepy book i would read it again lol.
  Negative
if this book is so great then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone to the best of my knowledge only erudites and scholars enjoy this book a good book but one with a limited audience dont read it unless you dont mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences antiquicated words and flowery prose personally i like an author who gets to the point.
  Negative
this book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written hawthorne is a great writer but i dont know how this book made it into that sacred list we call classics perhaps on the merit of his name alone.
  Negative
the scarlet letter by nathaniel hawthorne is a great novel it takes place in boston massachusetts during the era when puritans were there the main character hester prynne is forced to wear a scarlet letter a for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from europethe book really recaptures what puritanism was like its interesting to think about what america would be like if we were still puritan a theme of the book is concealed guilt the minister arthur dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain the message of the book is that you shouldnt let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your lifethe book denounces the religious atmosphere of the puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of old england you get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of chaucer was lost in america due to the influence of the puritans.

i couldnt listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if youre into audio books.

i ordered the penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started it was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination i paid for the penguin edition i got the  dover thrift edition three weeks later when i called the distributor he told me to email him to remind him to fix it but he didnt ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer i asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email the email address from the confirmation email didnt work i had to spend another  to get the correct edition of the book id already paid more for the book that i got than it would have been worth brand new i will not purchase from this distributor again.
  Negative
much to my amazement this book has been placed on banned lists in several states its an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt although the story does allude frequently to adultery there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear.
  Negative
the best book that i have ever been assigned to read for school by far the way in which hawthorne captures the shame that hetser  the wearer of the scarlet letter feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with hester and the revenge ridden character of chillingworth is spectactularthe way in which hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader since hester the main character concieved her daughter pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet a on her chest for the rest of her life the story starts on the day hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of boston starts from there a must read for any american.
  Negative
although this book is considered a great work of literature written to describe the harshness of purtian new england plus this book was heavily laiden with symbolism and many other literary toolsthe scarlet letter is a soap opera and a bad one at that not only is it boring no true action occurs in this book nothing truly interesting happens in this book this boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison dooralthough the author did a creative job of conveying his point this is still the worst book i have ever read i would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first  pages this is a good book to study however it is not a good book to read for pleasure under any circumstance.
  Negative
one might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors although i respect those who disliked the scarlet letter i disagree its no wonder that people that dont know how to capitalize the word i i thought that this book was wonderful if you are willing to put effort into understanding it.
  Negative
i had to read this book for school i did not like it im not sure what the point is of this stor.

i used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose i would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if youre worried about the environment.

the early success of adam sandlers films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer this film proves he is neither  and a grating voiceover guy to boot i enjoyed happy gilmore and to a much lesser degree little nicky and big daddy but sandler is a onetrick pony weve all seen the trick so its just not interesting anymore i thought this might be the one hanukah film in a world of xmas fare it has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids.
  Negative
god what a dumb movie the fact that adam sandler can do this is just wrongnever lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheesesick and demented jokes dont help its premisethough whitey gets a few lifesnicely animated but a poor outcome think of this as a guide beofer watching itjon lovitz rob schneider and others contribute voices.
  Negative
a movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays although not a childish movie eight crazy nights is a fantastic sandler movie.
  Very positive
the movie is vulgar and not meant for children it is a typical adam sandler movie with foul language and raunchy humor not enjoyable at all.
  Very negative
crazy nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids but the scatological humor offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my year old the plot on the other hand while fine for year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience as a result while its probably not the worst film of the year it is certainly in the running.
  Negative
this film has the dubious honor to be included in the book the  worst films of all time it is definently not one of those but one can hardly call it a proper film either it is rather a loose framework in which  new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner a greatgreatgrandfather of music videos and better than some of those.
  Very negative
i have too but this isnt it the translation is very choppy the singers are medicore at best and the orchestrations are too overwhelming love changes everything is shredded to the point where it hurts to listen to itoddly the best song is the french chanson denfancei was very surprised as the japanese usually put out extramely good cast cds their cats and phantom and the tokoyo evita are all great but unless you are a total alw or aol fanatic save your money.
  Very negative
the first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read the print was readable and the illustrations were helpful i did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said but mostly it was very specific and practical the chapters most helpful were on emotional states and music its hard to find a book on this subject thats across the board dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brainrelated research issue from nutrition to memory as a scientist who also works with high school students i found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful if not enthusiastic its a tough subject to translate but i did get more than i thought i would out of the book mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material the books far from perfect but its the best ive seen so far on this topic.
  Negative
i was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition i would have rated it in excellent condition rather than very good i would like to thank the person who made it possible but have misplaced her name and address.

first of all i saw the review by tyley mike relite and thought he was grossly overcritical of everything and every instrument played so id like to hear tyley mikes album since he thinks he can do better  seriously i think some people dont understand that things sound the way they were meant to sound if they sound poppy they made it that way why the hell should they stick to the norm they want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds greati cant write a good enough review for this album all their albums actually as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting it bugs me when a group doesnt evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were all the time so i was glad to see them progress and growtheres too much to say to describe this album but frankly i dont think i could write a good enough review to do it justice so ill just give it my  stars .
  Negative
i had never heard fair to midland before hearing this music but cant help making comparisons it is still wonderful music and ill explore it further.

a bit of a change this time for dredg less progressive material more straight ahead rock tunes i was a little disappointed in it it doesnt have alot of stuff going on like with el cielo which is pretty big compared to catch without arms but still this is the direction they chose to go in and its definitely a very good one.
  Neutral
this book really bothers me if you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability do not read this book it does not offer any advice for parents just helps fuel negativitiy please do not put yourself through reading this book if you are still in the grieving stage this book will not help you as parents please try surrounding yourself with positives children with disabilities can bring such joy to your life they can help you learn help you become more empathetic help you become stronger and bring wonderful caring people into your life please remember those things when trying to get through this time in your life do not waste your time listening to a families stories of frustration anger sadness and embarrassment instead surround yourself with positives.

one of the s rock bands that capture my ears its pity that they are almost retiring soon.
  Neutral
this material represents why the s died the music is bland and poppy the wilson sisters garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten.

  Negative
this is one of the sweetest sad funny and actually profound christmas specials ever well maybe not dostoyevsky deepness but there is quite a lot of depth here unlike a lot of modern christmas specials which are just plugs for toys the suits at cbs hated this series they thought it was too intelligent for kids and they didnt like vince guardaldis jazz score which is a bonafide classic now it almost didnt air luckily it did and we are all better people for it.
  Negative
i do love charlie browns christmas a joy for the entire family young and old a christmas play is being directed by charlie brown and everyone is complaining charlie is sad because he doesnt know the true spirit of christmas and his friend tells him the spirit of christmas the play was never finished thoughi like this toon because charlie browns christmas had the guts to tell about gabriel telling the shepherds about the good news that baby jesus was born in the manger i would recommend this to all.
  Negative
one of my favorite christmas shows of all time great service from the provider.
  Positive
when mr schulz and bill melendez decided to launch this halfhour special for tv there were many things against the odds the music subject treatment and linuss bible reading were unlike anything else tried on tv before work was done in just  months flat considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature and a lot of money and resources were put at stake lucky for them  and a lot of us  sparky hit the nail on the head this film was the absolute winner of next years emmy awards for television for kids programming along with more accolades and recognitions i think the different treatment of the christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and in true peanuts style is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious one of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season.
  Negative
this is a classic christmas tale and was a wonderful gift i bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year.
  Very positive
being able to watch something like a charlie brown christmas whenever i want is so soothing to the soul especially since i get really busy around the holidays and cant always catch it on tv.
  Positive
my children are a little old agewise for this but we all still enjoy watching it around this time of year this classic will never die out as it will be enjoyed for many generations to comehaving always been a huge fan of charlie brown to begin with this is by far my favorite christmas special i can remember seeing it for the first time like it was yesterday charles shulzz did one amazing job with this classic this short animated special shows children the true meaning of christmas and linus delightful explanation is timeless in its teachingthis classic is something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages but especially by families with small children this is just one great video that would make an excellent addition to anyones collection.

this ac adapter works great for me with my apple  aluminum g powerbook apple still wants to charge an insane price for this lastgeneration power supply but luckily macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the priceit does not light up to indicate that it is charging which is too bad it was a nice touch.
  Neutral
when my mac powerbook gs cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after i had gotten my laptop i wasnt sure what to do since the macbook has replaced the powerbook apple no longer sells the adapter and to get the adapter online was really expensive when i found this option i was thrilled it has worked perfectly since the day i got it it is sturdier than the apple adapter and so i feel it will last longer also it is white like many of the apple adapters so if youre worried about the aesthetics of your computer this option is a good one i highly recommend this productmacally psac ac power adapter for apple g.
this product works well with no problems so far i have now had it for about a month and it keeps my ibook g running with no issues it doesnt have the light that indicates whether power is being received but thats a minor thing also doesnt have the easytouse cablewrapping things on the original but once again thats a mere quibble all in all i am satisfied with this purchase.
  Negative
a replacement adapter for my yearold g powerbook was going to cost  from apple the macally adapter is less than half the price and its built like a tank  the wires are thicker and the plastic is more durable the only thing you might miss is having the yellowgreen charging lightbut thats more of a luxury and not a necessity highly recommended.

its hard to find these types of chargers since mac switched to the magnetic type its hit and miss with the working my battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
  Negative
this is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around i own a  powerbook g which this is listed as being compatible withthe problem is that this isnt actually a watt power cord so dont expect to use your computer while its charging and dont expect to be able to touch the brick as its plugged in youll burn yourselfive returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a ton better.
  Negative
i love it its long and the connection is secure and it doesnt get hot its wonderful.

i bought this charger near the end of may of this year and it stopped working about  weeks ago it is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord it looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on amazon it charges quite slowly ibook g  i have a brand new apple brand battery so i dont think it has anything to do with that or the computer from now on i will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead.
  Negative
this product is advertised to work with the ibook g but it does notthis plug looks fine but despite what the product description stats it isnt compatible with the  to yearold version of the inch ibook g which i own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didnt workconsider yourself warned.

out of the difficult to open package this adapter worked for a couple of daysi missed the light on the end of the standard apple adapter yellow for charging green for chargedbut the price was right until it started cycling on and off the mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten boy was i glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between ac and battery unplugged the macally computer ran fine on just battery runs fine on the apple charger i had left at homethe good news is the return to amazon was extremely easy presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesnt void my refundive ordered a different brand with light this one may have just been a bad example ive had good luck with other macally gear.

this is a very disapointing book the author makes the complexe amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at nickle mine school into one diminsional disney characters there is no tension conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real just a oh so sweet group of simple peopleof course that does not allow us to learn anything from the amish and i am sure there is a lot to be learn from themthe author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the amish there were spots where i though o please get over yourself i didnt finish the book it was a waste of time.

statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances anyone playing in a longterm keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on the stats in this book are as good as ever as is the top prospect listthis edition falls flat in its essays in the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a  ratio this years essays are far more statitically driven and are written in a  ratio meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysisthis makes the book far dryer than usual and more of a chore to get through its still invaluable as a reference tool but as entertainment it falls a little short.

at the height of the age of reason the united states of america was created by men such as thomas paine and many others who held man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea individual rights down on paper in the form of the constitution of the united states of america paines contribution to this end is well known paine noted in this book that we have it in our power to make the world over again and they did man has a right to his own life and there is no law above this no one has a right to another mans life not god not the race not the dictatorship not the proletariat not the great society nor the new deal thanks to thomas paine and men like him we have it in writing we own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way lets work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters to the glory of man.

i was so happy with dollys hungry again and her return to real country i like new country  but now it is just like pop music quite a few onehit wonders but dolly parton like tori amos and ani difranco two that came to mind makes an entire album of great music instead of an album that showcases two hit songs if you like folkindie music i think you will love this bluegrass album her cover of johnny cashs i still miss someone gave me chills my favorite song is definitely will he be waiting for me this is bluegrass but i definitely like a female singing it it just mellows it out dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour i couldnt be happier im  have been listening to her since i was little and have never gotten to see her perform live but this album the critics arent just praising a country hall of famer  the album deserves every wonderful word.
  Negative
as a child i grew up in knoxville tn watching dolly partin on the cas walker farm  home show i remember her singing bluegrass back then and didnt really appreciate what i was hearing unfortunately she got away from her roots now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted cd that has critics and her fans screaming her praises dollys voice is perfectly suited to singing bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark the arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable as a tenneseean i wish she would have included her awesome version of rocky top or at least updated it dollys gonna give a lot of fellow artists a run for their money this year at the grammys with the grass is blue and trio ii a top  cd if i ever heard one.
  Positive
as usual dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice the musicians are the only good thing about this recording shes attempting to sing country songs bluegrass style and it doesnt work.

i loved this book when i was about eight years old and looking back on it its easy to see why william the main character is a gymnast just as i was whos rather shy and reserved just as i was but manages when its important to help the people around him hes immensely sympathetic and compelling and though the familiar fantasyland and evilwizardrulingafauxmedievalkingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre it surprised and excited me as a kidrereading it recently i found it didnt hold up as well as some of my favorite books from when i was younger such as madeleine lengles a ring of endless light but it holds up better than man.

this game is the angel of darkness  the control system is impossible  the menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage  i have played all the tomb raider games  this one is near to unplayable  this thing went straight to ebay  save your money for something good  the tr people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something  jeez  the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.

this review is intended as a review of the book not of the work of edgar allan poe as a poe fan i purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading poe on my kindle however the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it while there is a table of contents the individual works are not list ther.

this would be a great book for use in elementary school science classes it has a wonderful layout with many beautiful photographs if insects can be called beautiful the text mixed nicely with the pictures covers basic information on insects as well as various interesting facts.
  Positive
this is a wonderful victorianstyle novel about a manor house its mistress and her domestics wonderful that is until the middle of the story the author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story its spooky and interesting but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrators point of view time and setting make the rest of a great read a downer.
  Very positive
this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material might as well have been foil and the screws didnt fit well i was really disappointed in it dont buy it spend a little more and get a better one hopefully in other words poor design excuted with sub standard parts.
  Negative
this is the biggest waste of money i have spent in a long time it didnt even make it through one bag of leaves i would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back cant believe amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department take my advice and save your moneyi would have given it no stars but didnt have that option in my opinion it rates  stars.
  Very negative
i have read enough to know when im being preached to and huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re the human condition in the island i was very disappointed since huxley has the ability to write well even about esoteric subjects see the perennial philosophy for instance but ends up just making a hash of it here not highly recommended.
  Negative
it was a decent book but not a lot of new information for me for the most part it simply confirmed some basics i have long believed in  not living out your dreams through your children encouraging exploration without forcing achievement the need to provide for additional means of learning etc a lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids which really doesnt apply in small towns like we live in some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods a lot of real life examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approachprobably the most novel idea that came across was that its better to be a good enough parent than a perfect one by kleins opinion if you manage to be the perfect parent you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example not sure im  with that but it is an interesting take on parenting.

this software is not user friendly the samples dont help i would imagine that if i sat down for a few hundred hours i could figure out were the dots go the whole interface just doesnt make any sense its very time consuming total waste of  dollars at the apple store.

easy reading book which i would recommend for those who want a sort of executive summary of the story behind wright and his works having said this i found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time not for collectors unless you like myself want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view.
  Negative
a bit simplistic at times but got some good discussions goingin our sunday school class methodist would recommend itfor contemporary adult sunday school classes or bible studies.

while the shipping was amazing the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems the text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out it would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource wo an instructor leading.

this is a really cool record to own my favorite muffs albums are happy birthday to me and alert today alive tomorrow so i like their later material this hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but i really like it i think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how theyve improved with time good cd.
  Very positive
i was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade but sadly they have not having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out now that kim is in her s youd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these outtakes from the past.

this book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages the book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came beforethe basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people places and things that you like a way to chart your course is taken from alan lakeins how to get control of time and your life which is an excellent book strategies for dealing with misteps are also coveredthe author tries overtly to avoid religion but a slight christian undertone runs through the book probably unintentionally because of the authors and those he quotes cutltural background.

i ordered two in cowboy slim cut x i already had some wranglers the waist was way too small the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way these were made in mexico just like the ones i bought at target but the badging was different a rubber badge on the back right pocket not the thin leather wrangler badge at the rear right waist were these knockoffs not sure returned them and went to target where i got two pair for  each they were original and legendary gold not cowboy but still half the price pard.

stockings are not easy to find where i live in northern california and i cannot stand to wear panty hose i decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site i used to find a garter belt i really like the stockings they are darker black than the picture depicts them i prefer offblack the lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch so if you have large thighs you might not like them the next order i will order one size larger for that reason although i do not have large thighs my husband really likes them and the fact that i like them makes him happy i will buy more.

these may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not the magnet that is glued to the back of these is about  and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder i tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator if you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger stronger magnet  these hooks will be useful otherwise they are not worth anything i guess you get what you pay for.

both of these issues among others are examined in this simple yet complex story about a variety of characters all of whom we recognizewhat lies beneath the skin of the average person what do they believe in and why what makes their worlds shatter what would make your world shatterthe author never wastes a word entertwining the characters in unlikely but believable ways its a quick read that lingers with the reader to make you think about your beliefs and what you would do for those beliefsto each individual the book could be about god or the meaning of life or simply how you fit into the world this makes the book touching on a personal level i think every reader will find a different way and reason to love this book.

i am a big belva plain fan and have always enjoyed her books after the fire is a disappointing read what bothered me the most is the character of hyacinthwhat a weak and stupid woman she is not believable at all any mother will fight to the end for her children i kept hoping she would snap out of it but she never did she just kept trusting stupid men and believing them i will think twice before spending money on another belva plain novel in the future.

sweet dream baby by sterling watsonon a sultry summer river two young people explore small town life in the backwater of florida  this tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes its troubled families and brooding mysteries if you appreciate musical prose and gripping plots you will relish this haunting book i cant wait for the sequel so i can learn more about travis and delia.
  Positive
mathematically speaking this book is all nonsense for instance the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning this is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home he argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage but the details he left out just to make his useless point is the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month whereas the person who doesnt own a home has to pay may be k per year for rent that wipes out the savings that the author is claiming not only that that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord whereas the owner of the home builds equitymy recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book else you will be screwed if you follow his advice.

i bought the book because i read the review and it look interesting and funny but after the first pages i knew that this was a mistake is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time.
  Negative
i didnt really like the book if the author didnt write the sex portion of the book there would not have been much to write about what happened with nick and the law suit it was barely mentioned she could have written more about that and less the descriptive sex.
  Negative
awesome simply awesome i couldnt put this down and laughed smiled and even got tears a brand new favorite author.
  Positive
this was a really fun read the dialogue was witty and clever i really enjoyed the progression of the romance it probably could have been tied up a little sooner the last th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced i do wish more of nick and rachels storyline had been included just because i enjoyed their banter and potential i recommend to any modern romance fan.

great this is a kent henry praise and worship classic  you can not go wrong with this one do not sleep on kent henry ive mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders this man is gifted anointed and sings many spontanious praise and worship songs although there are no spontanious songs on this one his cds from his independent labels are loaded with them he has a talent for ushering believers into gods presencethe songs are a mixture of upbeat and mellow classics this is a must have this cd is out of print and if you can get your hands on one  do it quickly.
  Negative
first thing i noticed about this book was that the pages were stuck together no reallythey were the printer did not get it right when they cut the edges of this book there were many pages that had to be hand cut just to turn them i could not stand the  design then once i get everything readable i find that the information herein is oh about  years old and totally useless for current midi applicationsmight be ok if you are looking for a history of midi and want to spent an hour making the book readable by cutting the uncut pages so that you can actually read them.

this cd has instrumental experimental jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces some of the rhythm patterns have a latin flavor and feel very danceable others remind me of chill out lounge music a few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground i enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background i have not heard the other volumes in the series and so i cannot compare them with each other my only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent some are more mellow and some are more lively but the mood of the cd is more consistent than a lot of collections i have heard some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies two of them felt slightly dissident to me but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing.
  Negative
its old school jams i have searched and searched for this cd for the longest i have finally found it now i have to purchase it.

we bought this emer galilieo vacuum cleaner for about  more than one year ago the retractable cord broke after a short time we had to send the vacuum to nj to get it repaired by using the warranty after a month they sent it back with the same problem and the onoff button was broken as well i called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one this vacuum is very powerful however the handle hose is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use by considering its high price i guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner.

donal cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction i find his book to be biased towards the murphydolan faction poorly researched claiming that billy the kid was known as michael mccarty and his findings to be very questionable presents evidence without veryfiable sourcesafter reading this book i asked myself why did cline write this book he seems to not think to much of billy the kid so why write a book about him why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about james dolan and lg murphy.

the biggest problem with this dvd is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on jamess brake line the episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the dvd it would have taken like  more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order other than that it is a good dvd with  thomas and friends stories in which james is prominent i have a personal complaint too i purchased this in a store not online even though the box said it includes a bonus wooden train my box actually had a take along bertie in it my son didnt have a bertie so i was eager to get it but i didnt realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series my son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better.

the set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oillike substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous also the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened or dulled however you look at it i have difficulties cutting through even thin soft silicone sheets sharpening them with a rotary tool helps but i feel i shouldnt have to do that with a brand new product which i am sure is actually repackaged i cant imagine using them for metal let alone most rubbers despite the very affordable price i would not have purchased this set for the above reasons.

like this is breath of fresh air in the dance music world filled with meaningless technobeat with no specific direction this song brought back the good memories of the s by using a sample of the classic clean up the ghetto monday midnites freestyle story about his experience at a london underground discotheque is unique and his succintly clear and distinctive accent is rare and i like it a lot plus the song keeps you dancing till the last beat love it.

first things first homespun is an album of demos for apple venus if you dont have that record look there first although if youre new to xtc skylarking is the usual recommendationso a collection of demos what to expect essentially its a trackbytrack match for apple venus sonically you couldnt tell its so much a set of demos except in a couple places frivolous tonight because it sounds so complete in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes even in places you wouldnt expect it like orchestral workouts river of orchids and green manis it interesting yeah extremely and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original knights in shining karma but truth to be told unless youre a diehard you probably dont need to hear the work versions of this material more casual fans definitely want to check out apple venus its a fine record.
