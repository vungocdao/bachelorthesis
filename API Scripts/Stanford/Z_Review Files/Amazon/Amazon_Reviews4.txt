Review_new
i remember having to read this novel in high school and wanted to read it again i had forgotten most of the story and thoroughly enjoyed following tess through her trials and tribulations albeit some self imposed.
a beautifully written dark masterpiece about an unforgetable victorian girl her father discovers he is descended from aristocracy and drinks himself into a stupor unable to fulfill his obligations tess takes his place and through a series of misfortunes is sent away to rich relatives with the hope of getting financial assistance for her family she meets a rogue at the mansion and is taken in by him in so many ways fast forward she meets another man and falls in love through their tragic love story much is discovered about the morality rules and expectations of victorian societythomas hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work and he has conceived a story which will embed themselves into the psyche as one contemplates this work again and again its a beautiful love story and so much more highly recommended.
and hate it now my only revenge for being forced to read tess as a kid is to write a negative review as an adult so there thats done.
well i thought i was getting the student edition but i got the instructors edition i guess ill have to go back to bn.
i have been using this for several months now and i am not particularly impressed by it the liquid itself is smooth and silky and it goes on and washes off quite easily but it seems to not have done anything tofor my skin jurys sill out for me.
mars rising is the best documentary ive ever seen about the issues surrounding a future manned mission to mars shatners voiceover gives it extra credibilityrace to mars is the most realistic movie ever made in the manned mission to mars genre.
in an age of communist oppression we see a side of daniel daylewis reminiscent of the lovable letch newland in the age of innocence daniel plays perfectly a doctor living in prague who cannot tolerate oppressionor resist women and both influences drive him to do the unimaginable its amazing seeing two main rivals for his affections manage not to kill each otheras they pussyfoot around the painful truth lena olin sabina is the perfect seductress in her famous bowler hatand one can easily love as well as hate her as she tries to deceive the ever wise tereza tomas wife juliette binoche thumbs up to tereza who acknowledges what tomas cannot as she forces him to face his weaknessand their love provides a measure of redemption still its tomas decision to return to prague that results in terrible consequences if not for the needless eroticism this would have been a  star movie.
kunderas novel the unbearable lightness of being is absolutely amazing and this film falls so far short of it despite my almostimmediate dislike of the film i actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing hoping that daniel daylewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from kunderas book but i was sorely disappointedbut please read kunderas novel because it is wonderful i cant help but think that kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel immortality the present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films tv programs or cartoons what is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential.
the unbearable lightness of being is the ability to give your body without becomimg emotionally involved this is no problem for the hero of this film but it is a wrenching experience for the heroine who believes in emotional and physical fidelity to her mate and cannot change her feelings this film explores the difference between the two and the pain that one causes the other by his lightness of beingtowards the end the movie becomes a tearjerker so be ready to cry your eyes out.
a wonderful drama of the unfolding of two lives read the book too not for the shallowminded.
the movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book i told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me big mistake in the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes in the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations void of philosophy and psychology.
basically it goes like this eastern european intellects survive by being in constant angst and having lots of sex at the end of what seems frigging hours and hours of selfloathing when they finally find happiness they all die in a truck accident.
i have been very impressed by other pickin on music lynyrd skynyrd led zep santana to name a few i have however hendrix music did not translate well at all into the bluegrass style it was a great disappointment and this is one cd i will get rid of quickly.
as far as i knowthis predates anything else known as drone musicwhich seems to be a popular genre these daysthis is about as psychedelic as it getsyour mind wandering out into the infinite voidso good.
living in chaos is living in stability is a book involving true stories with powerful thoughts which are encouraging and uplifting this book is personal in that it is about peoples private lives and their experiences and yet it relates to everyday life because these experiences can occur to anybody whether you are at the peak of your life or beginning a new chapter in your life something drastic can happen and change your world around the stories are touching yet enlightening and they bring you inner strength to deal with the realities of lifei would strongly recommend this book to readers from all walks of life.
i try everything new hoping to find something that will show me some results right away and give me back the glow in my skin that seems to wither away as time passes and im only  anyway when i read about rice bran i thought why not  this brand contains a lot of rice bran  its like the nd ingredient in everything after water and there is nothing else in it i couldnt pronounce the stuff smells great and goes on nongreasy especially the face cream its like my face is so thirsty for it that it just sucks it all in the truerenu store gives you cute little pahmplets with details on all the ingredients and insturctions the packages are written in japanese so you need to read their instructions  and i even got a free gift of green tea  yum.
i have been looking for an all natural shampoo and this is a wonderful one it made my hair incredibly soft with tons of bodyi was incredibly surprised at how well it worked on my hair the sample is worth the price just to test it out.
i agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although i am a little biased kerouac is my favorite author this book inspired me to write a poem after i finished reading it and although it may not inspire you to do anything at all it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if youre an artist i read on the road the town and the city and just before this one the subterraneans which i found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were  or  pages long  this one was much more fun to read and i could not put it down if you really like jack you should also check out james baldwin and norman mailer.
less plot more pot than on the road where kerouacs most famous novel was all about reckless travel music girls and rebellion dharma bums is more introspective lots of meditation soul searching and existential ruminations about life truth and nature my only regret is that i didnt choose the book format as it was hard to keep up with all the philosophical ramblings while listening in the car.
im amazed at how many people find the dharma bums worth reading its kerouac at his flattest the sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty there is virtually no action and the buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived this is definitely not a kerouac book to recommend readers would to better to pick up a copy of desolation angels or excepting the  pages of transcribed conversation in the middle visions of cody if youve already read lots of kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart pick up vincent czyzs adrift in a vanishing city  lyrical experimental hothouse writing that takes a quicktalkin drifter out of his native kansas as far afield as berlin mexico city and paris and through it all he never loses his vernacular even when waxin metaphysical you might also try sliding over to henry miller  not tropic of cancer which is his most popular but sexus which is far better written.
the operative word from the title is bums this is a book about them and their self indulgent self righteous idleness a work with no redeeming features.
very disappointed the book is a great work but there are so many unreadable words in the kindle ebook edition that after a few pages of frustration you finally give up trying this product should either be taken off the availablity or corrected for errors so it becomes readable.
this book has changed my life it opened my eyes about how we think ourselves into misery im want to buy copies to away give to people in my life.
i pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for  but i was so wrong not only was it just the blu ray movie but there were no extras on either the blu ray or the regular dvd they rushed this out to trick us all this is worth  not  for  i bought the extended edition blu raydvd combo edition of suckerpunch and it came with over  hours of extras wait for the better verison this movie is so incredible save your money and wait to see it with the extras trust me i returned this the day i got it and will be saving up for the deluxe edition and maybe even the box set with tons of extras.
this film is like a teenager with short attention span storytelling is like facebookingtoo many plots to cover horrible pacing no depth.
the d was awesome in this movie makes the movie even more better this movie was more darker then the other movies ther some comedy thrown in at the right moment.
im an original transformers fan from the original cartoon there was action from start to finish and the love story didnt slow thing for me ive watched this movie numerous times and still see things i missed the first few times i watch it loved it.
all i can say is awesome the family loved it and was so very happy to watch and enjoy on a great family evening thanks bunches.
transformers dark of the moon my granddaughter really enjoys watching this dvd she especially likes bumble bee she is fascinated by their transformation.
when i saw a review giving this movie  out of  the rd time this respected source has ever done so i should have listened if  had plot holes  has plot chasms there is no story a few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film plot charisma fan service michael bay really needs to stop raping peoples childhoods a la south park george lucas stylego watch the  animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is the dark side of the moon and im not talking pink floyd.
i mean this was never the greatest movie ever but i own the other two so logically i had to have this one came quickly shipped well no problemsexcept the film itselfjustbad.
this rated as one of the worst movies that i have ever see i found it to be a total waste of my time unless you are a devoted transformers fan that must see or have all things transformers stay away from this movie.
i did a search for d movies on amazon instant video and this movie came up but when i purchased it i was disapointed to see that it wasnt d i am writing this review without watching more than  minutes of the movie so its not that the movie is bad amazon needs to relabel their d movie selection.
lots of loud noise and quick movements just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy pleasefor the love of god do not make another sequel this movie really sucked.
no surprises left and a highly predictable plot but great action scenes and spectacular special effects tires hard to reinvigorate the first episode but lacks the suspense and drama my  years olds got a kick out of it i got bored.
absolutely rubbish would not feed this film to a dog simply not good by any measure you really ought to find something else to do with your time sure wish i did.
by most accounts the michael baydirected transformers films to date are not very good but that hasnt stopped them from making gobs and gobs of cash and this third installment dark of the moon made the most of them all this time around sam witwicky and the autobots must race to recover and protect an ancient autobot ancestor who crash landed on the moon but the decepticons interfere and things arent exactly as they seem i found dark of the moon to be an improvement over the second installment with some impressive special effects work and action sequences but the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired dont expect to find much more to the movie than ooh big robots and explosions but hey for some thats really all you need.
the movie wouldnt play steadily i had to watch this on netflix lateran error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasnt fast enough to play the moviemy internet connection was fine i had watched movies before and after and when i checked online with amazons customer service page i more than all the minimum requirementsthis is the first time ive had problems streaming with amazon but it was awful every  the movie would stop and pop up the error message i tried restarting the app restarting my ps and no luck.
i gave it one star because the website doesnt allow it to go any lower and for all the effort put in by the computer animation team other than that this movie should be negative  starthe plot and sequences does not make any sense what so ever to list a fe.
i went to see this with the hope of getting revenge of the fallens bad taste out of my mouthfission mailedwhere to begin the plot while being nowhere near as immature as rotf still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense its an overlong mess with the cgi eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film its clear that bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life its not his fort and hasnt been since the rock the movie peaks with a huge final battle in chicago that is nuts but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place the d is well used in spots but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection.
the first transformers movie will always be the best one and its just ok the movies too long jumping back and forth very poorly constructed.
great movie but no special features on it once i opened that movie i noticed that there is a off coupon for the d version that is coming out with special features.
the plotstoryline was not cohesive the movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life making a movie longer is not making a movie better in fact if the movie is weak making it longer just makes the point even more painfully obviousi kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the casemaybe dreamworks will just move on to another projectsave your money if you intend to buy better rent and save the rest for a better movie.
this is an enjoyable science fiction actioner with a fairly plausible plot for this type movie it also has excellent acting both the live actors and the voice acting for the transformer robots only beef is that its language makes it inappropriate for tweens and preteens overall excellent for adults and recommended.
a pure joy to watch with its many special effects it is a true master piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
the title of the disk pack is totally wrongit should be blue ray  dvd and digital copy available for dla gb download to get the digital copy instead of including it to me is lameyou enter a very long url then input the code and start the download managerafter it is finished you have to enter the long url again when you try to play the movie and get a error  website not foundi can get to any other web site i enter but not to the transformers site so now the digital copy will not play because the site cannot be accessedparamount should take lessons from fox on how to include the digital copy.
so for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching this is a hollywood movie made for an audience who loves explosions cars guns sexy women and a simple story line this movie was not made to be realistic it is a sci fi movie just pop some corn watch it and enjoy way better than the notebook or any other chick flick out there.
i was very excited to see this movie available on amazon prime but i was disappointed once i started watching i really couldnt stand sams new model girlfriend she was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily i was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the decepticons were because they seemed very similar of course i must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if i had followed more of the transformers cartoon another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building theres foreshadowing when the nasa guy announces that theyre going to be taking refuge in a glass building what could possibly go wrong.
watched this one and the previous one several times like this movie lots and so did the kids thanks so much.
i know a lot of movies arent going to be kid friendly that you will have to fast forward past some things but transformers that advertise a kids theme sold as toys at stores can be find in macdonald happy meals so you would think the movie be for kids but it not they focus more on sam and love gal then what the robots story forget sam the name of the movie is transformersi rate this movie starlove the cgi for the robots but you barley seen the robots the whole movies is about sam and his love interest michael bay need to hang this up and give it to a true comic fan who can direct a movie about transformerspitiful.
as another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me i threw them in the trash.
do not bother cena does not have the potential of the rock or even kane for that matter they are just trying to make more money off of the uneducated wrestling fan.
i am surprised by how much i enjoyed this surprised and a little disappointed in my own taste but anywayyou know exactly what to expect from this movie explosions fightingand thats it luckily it delivers both of those in spades especially the splosions i have never seen so many things blow up every fifteen minutes john cena barely escapes some building blowing up and in slow motion of course the story is kelly carlson is kidnapped by robert patrick and john cena must rescue herrobert patrick is plain fantastic in this flick the filmmaker is smart as he gave the lions share of the line to mr patrick he plays a great sarcastic bad guy plain and simple john cena can act in the sense that arnold schwarzenegger can act mr cena lets his actions do the speaking thankfully plus hes a hottie sooverall just an easy cheesy blowemup action bmovie the extras are pretty lame though.
might actually watch this if cena wasnt in it if his acting is any worse than his wrestling persona this will be his last movieupdatemarine ii will star ted dibease hahahahahahah lol pathetic.
this movie really is a complete stinkpotthe acting is horriblethe action is way too over the top and unbeleivableand the comedy is way too stupid and cheesy first off the movie gets started in a crazy action scenewar flashback no story what so ever the car chase scene is so full of it a car gets shot with a high powered rifle like  times and is still driving around even the twist at the end was completely easy to figure out please avoid this reeking exploding crock of .
ive had many problems with sony computer items before but i thought id give this one a try after being on the phone with sony who didnt even know what the emarker was for over four hours i still cant the thing to work theres some problem with the program you download from emarkercom the program has problems loading the emarker usb drive into your computer thus you cant use it at all if i were you id wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems sony told me they would pass my problem on to the research and development team who would try to get back to me as soon as they can i hope this team knows what the product isas for me i plan on returning my emarker today.
excellent product but sony is taking down the support for the product at the end of sept so dont bother buying shame as it was really good while it lasted.
i recently purchased the emarker by sony it shows how far technology has come it also shows how useless some of afformentioned technology can be it looks great attached to my keyring needless to say with its sleek stylish good looks it attracts lots of attention the main problem is its lack of extremely useful features i hope sony makes some revisions and releases a better more useful product like we have come to expect from them.
i too bought into the hype that the emarker presented but after using it for a week i realized how pathetic this product is its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and nothing else you have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station it doesnt even do that how stupid does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it tsk tsk the product is also really dependent on the internet so if you dont have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker actually even if you do have a cable or dsl line its still useless.
where is the space for a zero star just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing i should have read these reviews first all the bad you hear about this little thing is true i am not priveliged enough to live in an area sony feels compelled to offer service in so i dont even have one station to mark the site is terrible and i cant even get the program to enable itself whats the difference though cant do anything with it anyway this is typical sony my advice check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area believe me they wont tell you it will not work in your area it however is a neat idea needs lots of work.
emarker started to lose its appeal when i had a problem with the driver sony provided little assistance with the situation and i basically had to solve it through trial and error the website was easy to manuever through but receiving the proper listings wasnt constant i will give sony credit for coming up with the idea and respect its potential however for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain.
use of the emarker depends on the emarker website however sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website and so emarker devices will now be useless dont buy one unless you want a museum piecefor those of us that already own an emarker sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every emarker returned directly to them.
sony has stopped supporting the emarker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one.
before buying this product i read all the reviews unfortunately i didnt pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesnt work i thought i could trust a company like sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error i was wrong the complementary reviews on this site just cant be real the product looks nice but works like a piece of junk.
did the national socialists require censorship here or something the new artwork isnt even scary wtf youve ruined a classic no one buy this bs.
as a child i would stare at the gammells illustrations while rereading each story over and over the illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion the new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice i am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print dont buy this for yourself or your kid i loved these books so much when i was a kid that i am actually going to write a letter on paper with a stamp to harper collins telling them about the role that crazy art had on my imagination and development as a creative person jeez absolutely terrible the new illustrator must have no dignity to ruin this.
while the stories in the scary stories to tell in the dark book remain the same the stephen gammell illustrations that haunted my imagination have been scrapped for more candycoated pictureshow candycoated upon searching for the other tales of horror by alvin schwartz in a dark dark room which was written for level  of the i can read childrens collection i found those watercolored images to be scarier than the cartoonish images in the rerelease of scary stories to tell in the dark.
i was very disappointed to discover that the copies i ordered the scary trilogywhile described as being illustrated by stephen gammell were actually the updated versions with watereddown artwork by another artist i am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork this is the first time ive been disappointed with an order from amazon but its a big one you need to change your description to include the correct illustrator.
this video was let down the historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster and a pain to fast forward thru every time i want to practice dancing i agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to freestyle and improvisation i am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly and without any commentary i find myself struggling during this part or worse  just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated on the positive side the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful especially the belly roll and undulations i was really struggling with those and im now confidently on my way i wish they had covered more moves in that manner bottom line its been a week and im already seeking out another video to buy.
the shoe seemed nice i purchased the e version since i read in another review that they can be tight unfortunately the top of the tongue bit into my ankle when i tied the shoe didnt matter which sock i wore i had to return.
i bought this book thinking it would be an updated and improved version of the  bookarmed and female twelve million american women own guns should youby the same author that book was excellent and i wanted to have the latest versionunfortunately what i received was a much more expensive pamphlet only  pages for over ten dollars that abounds with typographical errors to the point that the errors change the meaning of the sentence in several places as if that werent enough much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and web pages that can be read for free after a simple google searchto sum up the  version of armed and female is a wellwritten and interesting resource albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition calibers and of course the makes and models of available handgunsthis book is unfortunately only an overpriced badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere.
all of paxton quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes men are usually stronger  larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity i purchased these books as gifts for the women i care about as a guide which points them in the correct direction.
while there is some very good information in the book i ask you to consider the source ms quigley has testified on behalf of a woman shooting a gun down a hillside toward a strip mall at some dogs that were barking but not approaching her that she was acting reasonably the jury disagreed and convicted the defendant she was testifying for of grossly negligent discharge of a firearm her approach is a bit aggressive.
we visited the dingle peninsula of ireland this fall and had to see this movie that was filmed there turns out that in addition to having great scenes of the dingle countryside it also has a very good story line and terrific acting and some irish history thrown in for good measure.
this movie would make a great opera adaptation dare i say sara miles carries the movie more than the david lean imprint and the obnoxiously heavyhanded score.
a surprisingly bad film painfully slow paced and convoluted it really is one hell of a mess the exploitation of a pitiful malformed character played by john mills is so over the top insensitive and with a tasteless comic bent and so frequently employed that it demands mention the story feels minor to begin with but is so disjointed and inane that it is best described as no story at all the music is hard to describe ill be kind its not helpful the only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous almost hypnotic cinematography that and perhaps a young and radiant sarah miles that should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing and just a little devotion to good taste but instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director david lean.
i saw this movie when it first came out it was hauntingly beautiful i am so happy to get it on dvd some may find it a little slow in areas but i loved it if you appreciate the work of david lean and the acting of sarah miles and robert mitchum then you will love this it ranks right up there for me with dr zhivago which i also had the pleasure of seeing when it first came out on the big screen a wonderful epic movie the seller was extremely prompt and made the purchase feel as though i was buying from a friend way to do business.
it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have  stars di u think it would be great  my  year old.
i love my photosmart  but was a little discouraged when the driver for xp was not available the neat thing about this printer is if you mainly use it to print photos from a memory card you dont have to be connected to your pc just know which numbers you want to print enter and off it goes the quality of my prints has been great right now its connected to my imac and is doing splendidly its quite dependable and not expensive id recommend it highly.
i guess im not totally up on the meaning of grindhouse one would assume by the title and the tags that these would be sex filled movies with a little plot thrown in for good measure they were full of slow moving plot and sex scenes that would make a censor in the s proud.
sorry about the star rating  it is not for the books content i cant read it but for the horrible way it displays on my ipadthe cover page is nice and big fills the screen and looks great ever subsequent page however is about half size meaning that two pages fit across the ipad screen and the font is too small to be readablefurthermore the ipad version only allows landscape viewing and the stupid kindle app remains in this orientation after returning to my books list and moving on to another bookam i missing something here.
puss in boots is a wonderful story this book is so beautiful that is like a precious work of art a great read aloud with exceptional illustrations children and adults adore it presenting this tale to children takes great thought though try to avoid the dishonesty terrorism and thievery and focus on resourcefulness first impressions and survival fred marcellino is one of the top illustrators of our time wish he had a website.
i read this entire book from front to back in  day it was great full of useful information and makes you feel that you can do this wether your the initiator or not.
the first  songs are incredible and the rest are ok i live in france and chumbawamba never got really big there so i havent heard tubthumping a zillion times which makes it still interesting to listen to.
i got this cd about a year and a half ago and i still listen to it it is a very good cd with about  good dance tracks plus the trumpet playing is great i also liked on how smoothly the music and the vocals came together this is truly a masterpiece.
besides the much maligned megahit tubthumping which i didnt like when it was first released but like now this is a solid cd with great arrangements lyrics and performances its not perfect but how many cds are perfect these days i have recently discovered ready mades and then some  clearly a star effort and a symposium on how to arrange a song masterfully done i wont write a songbysong critique here because several other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that however i do put forward a challenge to rtbarry in az to move beyond his very own drivel masquerading as a review if he is capable to explain in detail what in his opinion is lacking in this cd that rates it only one star or does he believe we are supposed to obey his fiat review as if he were kim jongil of north korea otherwise rtbarry dont waste our time with drivel.
this is really a great cd chumbawamba has many political and social thoughts you just have to understand them.
the one star is for the only one good song on this cd tubthumpingactually this song blows after you hear it more than  times this cd has only been in my cd player oncethat is the day i bought it if you like wasting money buy this cd.
i have had mine for about two years i love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in best quality an error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk ive down loaded the latest drivermore than oncebut with no success it has been a waste of money to meespecially when ink cartridges are so high for it.
stay away from this printer i have had a hp  and had moderate success with it after a few months the multiple paper pickup and jam problem kept occuring with no satisfactory fix i just got this printer and it is even worse it does not print correctly and multiple jams even after two hours out of the box the copy was consistantly misaligned i am sending it back.
again a good product but over priced i would try to find some gently used ones.
did i read a different book from everyone else i thought this was horrible i mean how demeaning to women to imply and then prove that a man would best a woman in strength every time even a woman with fighting skills then this whiny main character that regardless of all the obvious hands on facts that prove sabin is an honest honorable man she still calls foul and continues to abuse him in the worst way yet he continues to chase her help her and love her regardless when everything is added up moriah doesnt deserve a man like sabin lastly to top it all off after shes unloaded abuse after abuse on him he simply tells her hes a good guy and shes like oh well in that case i believe you and i love you how utterly stupid his actions obviously mean nothing but shell listen to what he sayswhambamterrible just terrible.
i was so disappointed in the first book foundation i gave it two stars ive been wanting to read the trilogy for years and i couldnt believe that that mediocre pulp was it but foundation and empire is the saving grace i look forward to the next book.
i liked this book i dont really have anything profound to say im only writing a review because for some reason amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a reviewasimov seems to have an interesting twist on european history in this book as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the roman empire the successor germanic kingdoms and the rise of the merchant class in the renaissance understanding the history of western civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to asimovs fictional galactic history.
the foundation novels are superb i went on to read the entire original trilogy the first foundation book being my favorite the story jumps ahead by leaps and bounds between sections which can be confusing at first but ends up making for a fantastic treat cant recommend this series highly enough for any scifi fan.
i cannot recommend foundation and its entire series highly enough when it comes to worldbuilding and examining the possibilities of earths future asimov does it best his entire basis is that intelligence learning and confrontation of the unknown will be our salvation instead of ignorance or seeing who carries the biggest gun a welcome change.
the book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea but then it dives deep into politics it is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the foundation specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way outthe problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the xvii century with its priests kings viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods the gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well for a far future based science fiction.
foundation and all the other books that complete the extense colection are wonderful i remember when i read this book  years ago and as you see i still love it if you dont want to read all the books of the series you dont have to do it the saga of foundation its only three books foundation foundation and empire and second foundation but if you want to read a good good goodgooooooooood series of books read them all you wont regret it i really loved all this books.
isaac asimov is an exception author in any genre he just happens to write in science fiction his foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction if you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose the universe he creates is so vivid that the book is difficult to put down in case you couldnt telli am a fan.
prelude to foundation is excellent however you should stop there foundation is bad this book is totally predictable read dune if you want something intelligent and entertaining read foundation if you want something that you probably wont even finish.
