Review_new
this is the second part of a two part series and picks up where jean de florette leaves off if you do not see jean de florette then you will be missing much of the background of this movie and the context is important for example without viewing the first movie the viewer will not know manons background what happened to her father and their farm the viewer will also not know the full relationship she has with the soubeyran clanthe quality of the dvd picture is avarage the picture is fairly clean and clear.
i bought a simpletech compactfalsh card of mb to use with my digital camera minolta dimage i but it does not work  the card works fine on my pc but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam i guess simpletech must be aware of the problem since their tech support emailed me that they would post a patch on their website as soon as they would find one but of course i had no clue of the compatibility issue before buying the card so i hope this might help some potential buyers.
its very simple everything i have ever owned by simpletech has died on me including this drive  usb sticks  sd cards and  cf card not one of their products lasted me more than  years and caused me a lot of headache.
i can still remember the force with which the first two or three paragraphs hit me reading them in a bookstore in albuquerque inventive humane human magical.
i have read this book in both spanish and english i believe it is simply the best novel written in the th century no where else does a book burn with the fires of imagination and dreams like this one it touches my soul with a something magical creating the world of the buendias inside of me someone once said finishing the book is like waking from a dream i agree.
before reading this booki had never realized that a book could be a piece of art as easily as a painting this book is akin to beauty bound in pages it is utterly amazing i personally do not understand why people say it is difficult to understand and even more difficult to get through i couldnt put it down it simple spoke to me rules to follow while reading this  pay attention and savor and  open your mind.
gracias a este libro recien llegamos a descubrir que toda la humanidad habito en algun momento en macondo olvidensen de las grandes civilizaciones del pasado este pueblo perdido lo abarca todo amor odio guerras y los buendia son como cualquier ser humano de este planeta esta novela son de las que se leen de un tiron no importa que afuera pase un viento huracanado como el que destruye al pueblo al final al cerrar la ultima pagina todos llevamos algo de macondo dentro de nosotros.
i only made it to  pages the book is just boring a lot of sound and fury signifying very little there are marriage.
marquez book takes the reader through the lives and times of what i hope is an atypical columbian  family covering from roughly the s to the s it was fun in parts but oddly repetitive with a style that seemed half magic realism half freud and of course the standard enervating antiamerican diatribes were thrown in i guess a latin american author even in magic realism mode cant overcome his predilictions.
the first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history its enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages unfortunately the book becomes one of the most overrated in historymany of the praises given say the book is difficult confusing and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book why why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good this is a parable with many characters magic realism a genre that deserves to be ignored though thats another discussion to give marquez credit his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under but it is nevertheless a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful and the intertwining of lives but they just dont move the story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all aboutmarquez book about miguel litton and news of a kidnapping are much better but this book just bores and bores.
this book changed me  it changed the way i look at things  the way i observe all the events in my life it wasnt easy to read at the beginning  but this book helped me get rid of depression writing the characters names with a brief about each of thm will help you alot.
this was my first encounter with the magical realism style and i love it the buendia family is quite possibly the most intriguing i have encountered in any book a must read.
im one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so i plugged away hoping id experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have foundbut i just didnt get it maybe it lost something in the translation but i prefer a little dialog in my fictioneven in my heavy pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction i dont mind the magic realism but i do get bored with sentences that run on for twoplus pages without a period oh well chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck whos educated beyond his intelligence but i was underwhelmed.
i read one hudred years of solitude like  times over the years and it still holds its magic and atmosphyre just an unbelievable classic it feels weary and long at moments also distracting at moments but its originality and magical ventures arise and fill the soul must have.
i have read this book  times and i can read it  times more and never get tired of it this is what a great piece of literture can do this book has such unforgetable scenes that one cannot differenciate between dream and reality that exists in the story but takes over your mind and dont let go till you set aside the book and even after you will be captivated by the imagineray that has gone into this masterpiece.
i approached this novel with reluctance a friend recommended it but said it was best to read it in the original spanish i dont understand spanish but i decided to try the english translation i was overwhelmed for days i was in a trance i could not and did not want to pull myself away from macondo and the buendia family the words hypnotized me the scenes evoked haunted me during the day and filled my dreams at night gabriel garcia marquez has created a masterpiece in any language.
as i opened this book i thought to myself wow this seems like a great story i found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page although the style and marquez technique are unquestionably wonderful the overlaying themes of lust lack of selfcontrol and immorality outweighed the good the goal of nearly very characters life is the sam.
this is what i think my problem is i didnt like the translation of the book if the novel was written in spanish and then translated into english i would sit there and say to myself that i loved the descriptive but not the flow of the sentence i am compelled to give this novel another try based on these reviews it has been a few years and i feel it is well deserving.
this translation of marquezs quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose the clarity and depth of hundred years symbolism and the excellent development of the buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time  a time of exploration political upheaval and social transition one criticism of this translation is the absence of footnotes to specific historical cultural or social elements of life in colombia in the past two centuriestaciturn silent insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house colonel aureliano buendia could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude p overall a great read.
this card has to be the bast purchase ive ever made the grapghics are great its directx supported a biggie and is far superior to most cards of the same price the reviewer who says it doesnt work obviously knows nothing about computers to know well enough whether his motherboard will work with the card if he bought the agp card maybe he should try the pci anyway this is a great video card from a great company for a great price buy it.
the whole city watch series is just about my favorite bunch of books i have ever read i almost have to read them alonme because i get the whole family looking askingly when i laugh out loud great stories obvious.
i nearly cried when i realized that this was an abridged version there is no indication in the record i was really looking forward to these cds.
carrot vimes colon nobbs are back with also alot of new recruitsangua detritus and cuddy what is the mysterious thing killing dwarfs clowns and assasins is vimes finally going to get married who knows.
i purchased this item for my son and it did not work right out of the box i followed all the terrible instructions and it still did not work i went to the coby website for answers and there was nothing there either i then attempted over  tiems to contact coby via telephone and was never able to get through i finally returned the product for a different bran i strongly suggest buying something else with a longer battery life and much better support and documentation.
this is one of my favorite shows i have contacted sony for a release date but i cant seem to get a difinitive answer this has been out for almost  years please post a response if anyone knows what to do or who to contact to request the other seasons be released ill sign a petition if that will helplw.
i was looking for a wellstructured sideby side version of the canterbury tales bantam classics normally does a great jobs on books but whoever transcribed it to kindle did not know kindle at all left it unstructured and the translation all over the place intermingled with the lines translating the wrong verses and generally just all over the placepractically i am reading four lines middleenglish five lines modern three lines middleenglish  lines modern  lines middleenglish and so forth there is no connection between the middleenglish and its translationthat was a wasted  usd for kindle version and a huge disappointment  .
beware of editions by general books llcthey produce books by scanning ocr copyrightfree material but without any editingthere are so many errors though that the result may be unusableusability probably depends on subject matter but the many ocrerrors make even prose an annoying readespecially mathematical and technical texts and texts with notes can become completely garbledsee the review of jm keynes a treatise on probability on this site which i bought but is useless and similar comments by other buyers on vanity fair by thackera.
the content  introductory notes translation  is great this is one of my favourite adaptations of the canterbury tales into modern englishthe kindle version however complete ruins the book the printed version presents facingpage translation which works great the kindle version attempts to do that having one page after the other not considering that due to the fontsize adaptability this doesnt work at all.
why did i think this rendition of the cantebury tales was translated into modern english it is the second of three items purchased from amazon and a second disappointment perhaps i should not shop online regardless it is a classic and i suspect not read by nearly as many who would enjoy it.
this translation allows you to read the stories which often are in poetry with pleasure i found the stories to be earthy funny but sometimes sad.
it is so incredibly disappointing that when such a fine film is released on dvd that the audio would be out of synch does anyone know if this an inherent problem with all the pressings.
im always up for another look at the titanic especially if new light is shed on the story unfortunately pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of ballards expeditions on top of that its not interesting the retelling of the events on the ship are fine but they cant carry the deadweight of pelligrinos attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story its the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting pass.
jenna reid has produced a debut solo cd of sheer quality from start to finish this young woman is such a stunning live performer its a joy to see she has produced an equally impressive studio recording stripped bare of over production lets her talent be heard fiddle playing of the highest order.
i really enjoy this album and the level of playing is admirable there is a good range of tunes which fit together well as a whole i think i listened to it about  times in a row when i first got it.
the usual girl goes to the big city cliches not as bad as what youd expect from mr bruckheimer thanks to the lovely and charismatic ms perabo and a nice performance from mr goodman as dadstill a gal who aspires to write songs and has absolutely nothing to say that whole whitneymariah thing yecchthe bar scenes have a certain energy to em but the other coyotes apparently have no hopes and dreams or personalitiesheres hoping the adorable piper will get a great or even better movie in the near future i will definitely be following her career.
this is a really good cheesy movie that girls and guys will both like however if your boyfriend doesnt like these types of movies then put in the unrated version in the regular version the kissingsex scene doesnt show anything but the unrated version shows lots of skin and is pretty steamy its definitely a cutesy movie but the eye candy and bar scenes will keep the guys watching piper perabo and the rest of the girls wont disappoint i promise.
i bought this movie because i love jerry bruckheimer movies i should have just rented it the only entertaining part of this movie was the bar scenes all of which were shown in the trailer that about sums up the good scenes when i watched the featurette about how hard they were looking for a lead actress and how excited they were to find piper perabo i couldnt believe it perabos acting was so annoying she ruined the whole movie for me her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded i just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling im one of those people who like all kinds of movies even some really bad ones but this is one that i dont think i will be watching again.
this movie is so dumb how dumb is it this movie is so dumb that even though it has a bunch of hot chicks dancing around in sexy clothes provocatively it is anything but sexy and provocative dumb dumb dumbdid i mention that it stunk too.
this movie is one of the worst ive seen in the past year right there with the whole nine yards and cruel intentions the plot is predictable the actors worthless or maybe the plot just wasnt any good and theres really no good reason to watch it see if this movie were at least rated r and they actually showed some ta instead of just hinting at it maybe thered be a reason to watch this movie what with all the hotties in it however bad dialogue combined with predictable plot bad performances by actors and hotties but no nudity makes for a totally worthless movie what a waste of my time.
i love this moviei watched it the first time with my best friend and then realized that i had to have a copy of it because its such a great movie.
i bought this cd initialey by mistake i was in a hurry and missed the cd i wanted right next to it it must have been gods hand directing me to this stunning album i had only heard the band on the radio and by the time song one was over i was hooked i sat there and let shirley mansons rich voice enthrall me through the rest of the cd i went out immeadiately and found their first cd which was just as good but in a different way that is what makes this a great band among other things the ability to reinvent without loosing the soulsound of the musictwo great albums i can only hope that they grace us all with many more.
this cd is even better than the first and if u are thinking about getting it my advice is to go buy it go spend a measly  bucks to get it its well worth the money.
its amazing how this sounds very odd the first time around you hear it then slowly it just hits you and you cant stop listening to it also this cd is sorta more insane literaly than the first one and its abit more slow paced rocks get it also this is the cd that got me nuts about garbage too.
garbage rocks shirley manson has a uniqe voice which is great the music for this record are very expressive and the tunes are very singable.
i bought garbages first album first and i thought the album was great boasting good tracks like milk queer only happy when it rains but the sophomore album was even better temptation waits started out with mansons menacing voice with simplistic lyrics like i tell you something i am a wolf but i like to wear sheeps clothing the second track had a rockier edge to it and then slowed down with medication and then it was fun all the way till you look so fine which ended the album with a sombre note like how garbage ended its first title with milka great buy almost perfection  you will just repeat it again and again without losing interest.
garbage is a band like no other you really have to take a listen to this amazing band to realize how one incorporates so many styles into one little albumthis album is packed full of classic garbage songs that can really give you the chills the opening track temptation waits was very eerie the first time i heard it and i loved it the next track i think im paranoid has that heavy bass and light vocals that the band is known for love the lyrics tooa great album for anyone looking to continue digging thru garbage a word of advice thoughdont bother with beautifulgarbage if you are a rock fandefienatley not impressive.
garbage deliver more terrific eurotrash rock on their second album s version  another mix of crunching guitars wild beats groovy keyboards  effects and the sensual voice of shirley manson the band are still the frontrunners of modern rock with such great rockin tracks as temptation waits i think im paranoid push it and my personal fave sleep together theres also playful poprock with special with shirley tipping her hat to the pretenders chrissie hynde at the end the delirious hammering in my head and the truly gorgeous you look so fine fabulous music  production from a fabulous band version  is essential garbage.
been watching this show on dvd since i got it it made me even make want to get season  in the store which i did its a great show one of my fav shows.
after reciving the th season set and it would not worki made a short phone call and had a replacement the very next daywow what servicemy granddaughter also thanks you.
disregard stories about how hellman cooked up this story and then passed it off as true or about redgraves protest at the oscars both apparently true certainly the second one is just see this movie because its simply one of the best movies and stories of all time the script and acting are both topnotch.
if you like jane fonda or vannassa redgrave youll like this moviethe content is dark but considering its wwii that wont be a surprise the movie is touchingsadand in someways makes you feel nice about love and friendship and in another way makes us wonder how far wed go in the name of friendship.
dvd arrived quickly and safely  good srvice would use these folk again no problems encounteredfirst saw this film in the early s at a seaside picture plcae on the east coast of england bridlington was charmed by thew story and the actors loved the moody scenery the dvd reflected the original perfectly and was most enjoyable.
i bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell but i was sadly mistaken when i got halfway through it and i kept hitting glich after glich i thought it was my xbox but i took it to a friends and glich after glich i guess i got the worst game in history but thats what happens when you get a massed produced game like this one.
what a great video i just received it and went through the routine the flow was wonderful i am not a surfer have never surfed i was just looking for a good video and everybody recommended this to me but maybe now ill be surfing by summer.
there are many better yoga dvds to choose from as a surfer there is no special surf yoga as opposed to regular yoga any surfer who takes the time to practice yoga will benefit peggys videos lack the vital instruction that beginners need to do poses properly without injury it is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community a better option is shiva rheas shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction and a yoga matrix which allows you to create your own unique routines most dvds become stale after awhile but the yoga matrix on shiva rheas dvd in addition to the  readymade routines prevent this dvd from ever getting old.
this is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type if you have a basic knowledge of yoga you dont need this at all  you can create and tailor your own workout if you dont know yoga its useless the instruction is poor peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga no wonder the surf mags think its great with little very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga in some scenes you cant even see their feet a crucial failure  even if the instructor says what to do save your money take yoga long enough to learn it properly then apply it to your own surfing yoga is great for surfing but this is a poor video.
if you know anything about yoga do not buy this cd the only positive parts is the location and view of the waves this is more a novelty than useful honestly who does yoga in a wetsuit at pipelinetry ali mcgraws video for a great intermediate yoga tape.
i purchased this book under the impression it had a book key for quia required by my profesorait didnt have any book key so now i have to return it and just buy the one from the bookstore like i should have done from the beginningalso ups was a day late and didnt leave the book as i requested by signing the leave package form left by the delivery man i had to go pick it up myself because im never at home.
this thing is ok but realize you must hold it onto your blow out port to make it work therefore you need  people to blow out your pipes when you are blowing out an rv constant air pressure is the key so saying that i ripped off the needle and attached an air chuck fitting to it now i just screw this on attach my air hose and pop on the compressor and i no longer need to hold it in place.
when i selected this book i was looking for a book i could share with young children ages  years and up to give them a glimpse of nigeria its people and culture i liked the photographs which accurately depicted various professionslifestyles in nigeria and some of them provide wonderful ideas for story book extensions for example the photograph of the grandmother making a traditional outfit could be complemented by presenting to the children a few yards of woven fabric that is typically used in nigeria for such outfits other professional roles we see nigerians in are baker doctor wood carvercarpenter lawyer potter blacksmith and finally the traditional native doctor or herbalist who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties all in all it paints nigerians as an industrious people which is what we are.
my son was very excited as we put the cd in the player but when the music started he was very unhappy the songs dont sound anything like the ones on the show the melody and pace are different and the performers arent interesting dont buy if you are familiar with the real songs.
this is my first lou reed video i can honestly say that i enjoyed it i have gained some new perspective on lous music he is a true professional before i turned it on i knew i would like my favorites sweet jane and walk on the wild side but i found myself enveloped in the other songs which i had never heard before i was a casual lou reed fani think if i liked it then a real hardcore fan will love itthe video is high quality and the sound is great its like having a front row seat im glad i purchased this one.
 to jazzie of hampstead london dont know what you were looking at your last graf where you make up some quote from lou at the end of the show is totally bogus in fact lou says just the opposite pay no attention to that innacurate review lou has his good nights and his bad nights this was one of the best performances of his career.
so far i really like it its very informative and useful i would have given  stars but i have it on kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper its difficult to flip through the book and find what you need but i am fairly new to kindle so maybe its just me or old fashion enough to prefer a book in hand but i do recommend it in whichever form you prefer.
i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man i urge you to avoid it at all costs you will not notice the insipidly simple tune working its way into the core of your being and thus transform you into a similar state of insipid simplicity for kylie minogue i can find many uses  for her music i find none.
this movie is about two twins who look alike and they are on there own soccer teamthey switch teams without their mom nowing.
i think this movie was great i just couldnt stand the bad acting of the guy marykates character liked he seemed to be angry at her even when they were just talking yuck.
this movie had bad acting the dad is dramactic and corney the mom is just corney and all of the soccer coaches are acting like it was big pro sports championship the olson twins were corny but entertaining to watch this movie is unrealistic that emma ashley and sam mary kate were on  different teams its a rule that siblings be on same sports team this movie has bad quality actors and a unrealistic plot.
switching goals was very good the plot was better than the average mary kate and ashley movie but it wasnt as funny or had as good of acting as the others this movie is good to watch a couple of times but only a couple times if you have extra cash though i say get it you wont regret it.
my son wanted this video so we got it there is a danger in making things that children think are real maybe a few more warnings in the video saying this is not real would be good.
langston hughes is definitely a better poet than he is a novelist i found this book to be lack luster and boring although you may like a character or twoin general the characters were not developed nor were they intriguing his wording lacked the rapture that we are accustomed to him delivering.
i really liked this book the characters were intersting and the relationship sandy had with his grandmother made me think of my grandmother the book would be good for young people to give them a idea of what black life was like back in the s and s.
i contact the company by e mail to return the product as directed the company e mails back to ask for a reason and if the product was opened i replied and the company did not what is the next step to return the product .
it is a great suit great buy great service all around i would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a frosty suit to buy one of these.
as other reviewers have suggested this book is full of errors i used this book along with the official guide and the rea book which is much better for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless there are so many errors that i found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that i didnt already know to be accurate which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide many of the mistakes are obvious but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in errorthis book is not worth the time.
i just began using this book to review for the gre in april i havent gotten very far into the book but in the first  pages i have already found four seriously misleading errors and thats just the ones ive caught some of the equations even the hendersonhasselbalch they provide are wrong there is even a convenient example worked out with an erroneous equation you can use this book to learn about what topics you should study for the gre but do the actual studying from real chemistry textbooks.
this is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this cd are all of them if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do.
this is too small for the age of child its designed for i swear there used to be a larger version plus it didnt survive more than a few sessions of our play group before the spring broke.
my  year old son received this as a christmas gift once it was initally setup he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger very gentle however after  rounds of play we were unable to get the teeth to pop back up or to get the rest of the teeth to push down needless to say he was very disappointed as was i does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one.
i specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose it was to be taken on a trip to visit with my  year old grandson what fun we laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns well after less than a day the only tooth that would cause the jaws to snap was the center tooth not too much fun there i feel i wasted my money.
yes this video is bad quality but it is great to see bowie and the spiders in their final concert bad quality or not im only  and obviously never had the privilidge of seeing them live so this is a great opportunity i believe the ziggy era was the most fascinating and exciting adrogyny is the only way to go.
imagine action films were  minutes long there would be no time for subplots or romantic involvements or no you go on without me  all there would be is car chases and explosions godwills book is rather like thati liked itforget the measured blend of theory fact and example which is the style of oreillys authors this book cuts to the chase and it worksyou see tomcat is a servlet runner it isnt that interesting or even the best of breed jetty is way better tomcat is as interesting as what you do with it and goodwill drags you along through a flash tour of all the goodiesits a bit like a night tour of naples on the back of an italian cigarette smugglers vespa somehow at the end despite not having understood much you find you know your way around and feel comfortable exloring further on your owntake it or leave it thats just the kind of book it is.
a waste of timeglory for old time movies that try to claim a life in a new world and they dontdont bother a nice tape to record overand the last time i buy a film because brandon frazier is in it naked or not.
one of the best films ever made gods and monsters works on many levels it presents the many roles men play  gaystraight husbandbachelor parentchild lovermonster youthelderly whitecollarbluecollar  wrapped in a captivating story listen for the musi.
gods and monsters is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director james whale  who directed frankenstein and bride of frankenstein the acting is superb especially ian mckellan in the lead i thought it dragged in a few areas but on the whole it was a great movie.
one of the few recent films that i anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectationssir ian mckellen once again performs well the real surprise here is brendan fraser thanks to bill condons amazing screenplay fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to mckellens anguished and selfdefeated character make a point to get this one best screenplays consist of strong dialogue pacing and narrative the oscars are usually accurrate about that.
the manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed and the pole in the center of the tree was bent beyond redemption i have no idea how this tree looked all put together since i had to repack it and send it back thankfully amazoncoms return policy is generous and swift  they get five stars for service in the meantime it was a real tree for me again this year    i may try to go with an artificial one next year but will not order one online again.
of the  baseball books ive read babe the legend comes to life is my favorite creamer wrote the book while some of the oldtimers were still alive and this makes his story come to life if you want to learn about babe ruth this is the definitive book to read.
this book was excellent the author gives us an intimate portrait of one of the greatest and most colorful athletes of the th century babe ruth overall we learn a lot about him and baseball during the roarong s into the smy only issue was that i didnt like the way the book abruptly ended with his death i would have liked to have read more about his funeral and the aftermath of his death plus i would have liked to learn more about how his legacy was treated the years after his deathnevertheless this book is a great read and i highly recommend it to any baseball or sports fan.
my car is a  honda civic ex save yourself a headache and get this if you have to replace your stereo plug and play.
this is the first book ive read by meg wolitzer and overall i enjoyed it the plot brings three justturnedthirty friends into close and prolonged contact with the something mother of their recently deceased friend wolitzer is able to pull this off because she obviously likes all of her characters their various flaws notwithstanding she also has the type of sense of humor that allows her to ligthen things up when emotions and events threaten to drag things down too much the strongest character is the mother natalie who is one of the more appealing baby boomers in recent fiction and by no means a mere caricature my only objection is that several secondary characters are not as clearly drawn as the main ones but in fairness to wolitzer in most novels the reader would not even care about knowing more about such relatively minor characters and its only her gift for making you care that makes this an issue at all.
the novel is a wrenching pageturner about a womans loss of an adult daughter and her subsequent attempts to cope and live the author artfully describes experiences of the mother and the dead womans friends as they provide each other with memories and support needed to adapt to the sudden death of a young woman whom they loved it is the best book i have read all year.
i looked forward to reading yet another meg wolitzer novel and i was very disappointedin fact i lost interest early on and never finished it some of the authors earlier works such as sleepwalking and hidden pictures were excellentwhat happened.
good book to start wit.
i got this book because it had such awesome reviews im going to be taking a test in the near future and youre allowed to use a medical dictionary and i picked this oneive been taking practice tests on the first practice test i took the first  out of  medical terms i tried to look up werent in the book i was stunned and several of them were pretty basic words that i just wanted to get a very clear definition ofim not sure its even going to be worth lugging this book to the test or even keeping the book i may just sell it and try another bookjane.
i bought this bed recently for my  year old lab mix he doesnt dig chew or abuse things in any way so i wasnt concerned with getting a super abuseproof bed but after a couple of weeks of limited use i found a hole in the soft side of the bed the fact that this side attracts hair is unfortunate but a hole being made almost immediately makes this bed not worth buying it may have been a decent design if it was made with sturdy materials very disappointing.
i love this video unfortunately it doesnt show on a blue rays dvd player which means i cant enjoy it  i was a bit frustrated however other purchases in the past have been great through amazon.
my copy even has an arrow pointer on the front cover picture talk about lousy merchandising no dolby much less dts only a pcm stereo recording video is average like proper packaging and presentation were no more than an afterthoughtall in all this looks like a bootleg edition and no its an official release amazing messy what were they thinking.
while even some members of the bonzos give this album low marks i personally think keynsham holds up very well without it we wouldnt have you done my brain in mr slaters parrot the definitive look at me im wonderful quiet talks and summer walks or sport the odd boy which would be a damn shame no matter how you slice it while this did prove to be the end of the line lets make up and be friendly notwithstanding there still seemed to be a lot of gas left in the tank.
i love this my kids have so much fun with these they are strong and hold up to ruff play they shoot water clear accross the pool.
i found it interesting it will be used in an adult ed class i will have a better idea of its uses after the class meets and discusses the poems how it reflects the times and how comfortable gabirol was in medieval spain.
if you follow my reviews you know that i am anglo catholic and that the  versions i use most are the good news and the original revised standard i have respect for the king james the new king james the jerusalem the english standard version and the holman christian standard i do not like the niv or the nrsv onto the subject at hand the nasb is widely praised as the most literally accurate version it does not contain the apocrypha but being that this is a protestant bible we cant really hold that against it the nasb is widely accepted in protestant churches for the most part it is carefully literal i consider it an interesting cross between the revised standard and the new king james my one slight complaint is that it is not quite as beautifully written as the revised standard but that said the new american standard is excellent.
i love all of clifton webb films this one really extracts his serious side of acting great film of the era he is truly the one of the best actors of his time.
so cheap and poorly made that when you use the item it cuts your finger every single time.
the examples which were given in the textbook were way too simple when you compare to the homework problems never explain how to do bode plot at all i am glad i know how to do differential equations before taking the class otherwise to use the method that taught by this book i would be dead they never explain well on those differential equations and the concept behind.
a book with a heavily religious slant anyone expecting a scientific discussion of sexual addiction should be prepared to read that god has responded to the arrogance of the human heart by turning people over to the control of their evil desires.
as a psychologist specializing in the field of sexual health i am utterly shocked and dismayed at this book for those suffering from sexual addiction or for their partners who are looking for some peace please do not invest in this propaganda this book is not based on the science of either psychology or sexual health and is nothing more than the worst aspect of religious dogma and will ultimately result in further suffering this type of hate mongering intolerant uneducated mindset is what has led to many of historys most devastating atrocities done in the name of god a basic ethic of psychology and counseling is that that counselor or professional does not impose his or her own values upon their patients shame on you for writing such a book and calling yourself a counselor you are an embarrassment to those of us who have dedicated our lives to trying to relieve human suffering.
this book was suggested to me by a counselor i was seeing to help me deal with the fallout of my husbands confession of sexual addiction we both read the book and it truly helped both of us to understand some of the underlying issues associated with this addiction there is so much information in this book and i would highly reccomend it to anyone facing this kind of situation.
