Review_New
we tried the baby warming dish we found that for our  year old it was pretty small and didnt really hold enough water to keep her warmi think it would work ok for an infant although i think a blanket would work just as wellrecommendationbuyholdsell.
as good as this book may be the print quality is so bad that i cannot read it zero stars would have been more appropriate.
i used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose i would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if youre worried about the environment.
the early success of adam sandlers films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer this film proves he is neither  and a grating voiceover guy to boot i enjoyed happy gilmore and to a much lesser degree little nicky and big daddy but sandler is a onetrick pony weve all seen the trick so its just not interesting anymore i thought this might be the one hanukah film in a world of xmas fare it has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids.
god what a dumb movie the fact that adam sandler can do this is just wrongnever lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheesesick and demented jokes dont help its premisethough whitey gets a few lifesnicely animated but a poor outcome think of this as a guide beofer watching itjon lovitz rob schneider and others contribute voices.
a movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays although not a childish movie eight crazy nights is a fantastic sandler movie.
the movie is vulgar and not meant for children it is a typical adam sandler movie with foul language and raunchy humor not enjoyable at all.
 crazy nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids but the scatological humor offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my year old the plot on the other hand while fine for year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience as a result while its probably not the worst film of the year it is certainly in the running.
this film has the dubious honor to be included in the book the  worst films of all time it is definently not one of those but one can hardly call it a proper film either it is rather a loose framework in which  new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner a greatgreatgrandfather of music videos and better than some of those.
i have too but this isnt it the translation is very choppy the singers are medicore at best and the orchestrations are too overwhelming love changes everything is shredded to the point where it hurts to listen to itoddly the best song is the french chanson denfancei was very surprised as the japanese usually put out extramely good cast cds their cats and phantom and the tokoyo evita are all great but unless you are a total alw or aol fanatic save your money.
the first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read the print was readable and the illustrations were helpful i did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said but mostly it was very specific and practical the chapters most helpful were on emotional states and music its hard to find a book on this subject thats across the board dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brainrelated research issue from nutrition to memory as a scientist who also works with high school students i found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful if not enthusiastic its a tough subject to translate but i did get more than i thought i would out of the book mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material the books far from perfect but its the best ive seen so far on this topic.
i was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition i would have rated it in excellent condition rather than very good i would like to thank the person who made it possible but have misplaced her name and address.
first of all i saw the review by tyley mike relite and thought he was grossly overcritical of everything and every instrument played so id like to hear tyley mikes album since he thinks he can do better  seriously i think some people dont understand that things sound the way they were meant to sound if they sound poppy they made it that way why the hell should they stick to the norm they want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds greati cant write a good enough review for this album all their albums actually as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting it bugs me when a group doesnt evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were all the time so i was glad to see them progress and growtheres too much to say to describe this album but frankly i dont think i could write a good enough review to do it justice so ill just give it my  stars .
i had never heard fair to midland before hearing this music but cant help making comparisons it is still wonderful music and ill explore it further.
a bit of a change this time for dredg less progressive material more straight ahead rock tunes i was a little disappointed in it it doesnt have alot of stuff going on like with el cielo which is pretty big compared to catch without arms but still this is the direction they chose to go in and its definitely a very good one.
this book really bothers me if you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability do not read this book it does not offer any advice for parents just helps fuel negativitiy please do not put yourself through reading this book if you are still in the grieving stage this book will not help you as parents please try surrounding yourself with positives children with disabilities can bring such joy to your life they can help you learn help you become more empathetic help you become stronger and bring wonderful caring people into your life please remember those things when trying to get through this time in your life do not waste your time listening to a families stories of frustration anger sadness and embarrassment instead surround yourself with positives.
one of the s rock bands that capture my ears its pity that they are almost retiring soon.
this material represents why the s died the music is bland and poppy the wilson sisters garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten.
contrary to other review i found my cell phone holder to be of very good quality and have used it for a long time now with no problems whatsoever.
i love christmas movies and these are some of my favorites i always bring them out when i am decorating and start enjoying the holidays.
i gave this movie to a coworker who loves all the charlie brown classics that are shown on tv she was thrilled when she opened it.
this is one of the sweetest sad funny and actually profound christmas specials ever well maybe not dostoyevsky deepness but there is quite a lot of depth here unlike a lot of modern christmas specials which are just plugs for toys the suits at cbs hated this series they thought it was too intelligent for kids and they didnt like vince guardaldis jazz score which is a bonafide classic now it almost didnt air luckily it did and we are all better people for it.
i do love charlie browns christmas a joy for the entire family young and old a christmas play is being directed by charlie brown and everyone is complaining charlie is sad because he doesnt know the true spirit of christmas and his friend tells him the spirit of christmas the play was never finished thoughi like this toon because charlie browns christmas had the guts to tell about gabriel telling the shepherds about the good news that baby jesus was born in the manger i would recommend this to all.
one of my favorite christmas shows of all time great service from the provider.
when mr schulz and bill melendez decided to launch this halfhour special for tv there were many things against the odds the music subject treatment and linuss bible reading were unlike anything else tried on tv before work was done in just  months flat considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature and a lot of money and resources were put at stake lucky for them  and a lot of us  sparky hit the nail on the head this film was the absolute winner of next years emmy awards for television for kids programming along with more accolades and recognitions i think the different treatment of the christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and in true peanuts style is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious one of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season.
this is a classic christmas tale and was a wonderful gift i bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year.
being able to watch something like a charlie brown christmas whenever i want is so soothing to the soul especially since i get really busy around the holidays and cant always catch it on tv.
my children are a little old agewise for this but we all still enjoy watching it around this time of year this classic will never die out as it will be enjoyed for many generations to comehaving always been a huge fan of charlie brown to begin with this is by far my favorite christmas special i can remember seeing it for the first time like it was yesterday charles shulzz did one amazing job with this classic this short animated special shows children the true meaning of christmas and linus delightful explanation is timeless in its teachingthis classic is something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages but especially by families with small children this is just one great video that would make an excellent addition to anyones collection.
watched this with my two year old daughter for the first time this christmas it was nice to watch a classic movie that i grew up watching as a kid myself with her as well as with my hubby the peanuts gang is classic and simple love them.
bootleg collection of bsides remixes and singles really why even bother.
this charger worked fine for a few months but now charges so slowly that using the computer while its charging drains the battery very frustrating very poor quality.
this ac adapter works great for me with my apple  aluminum g powerbook apple still wants to charge an insane price for this lastgeneration power supply but luckily macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the priceit does not light up to indicate that it is charging which is too bad it was a nice touch.
when my mac powerbook gs cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after i had gotten my laptop i wasnt sure what to do since the macbook has replaced the powerbook apple no longer sells the adapter and to get the adapter online was really expensive when i found this option i was thrilled it has worked perfectly since the day i got it it is sturdier than the apple adapter and so i feel it will last longer also it is white like many of the apple adapters so if youre worried about the aesthetics of your computer this option is a good one i highly recommend this productmacally psac ac power adapter for apple g.
this product works well with no problems so far i have now had it for about a month and it keeps my ibook g running with no issues it doesnt have the light that indicates whether power is being received but thats a minor thing also doesnt have the easytouse cablewrapping things on the original but once again thats a mere quibble all in all i am satisfied with this purchase.
a replacement adapter for my yearold g powerbook was going to cost  from apple the macally adapter is less than half the price and its built like a tank  the wires are thicker and the plastic is more durable the only thing you might miss is having the yellowgreen charging lightbut thats more of a luxury and not a necessity highly recommended.
i miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging but for  of the price of apples replacement i can do without itthe led is bright and cool bluish color the cable that breaks on apples charger is noticeably thicker on this chargerget this youll not regret it.
its hard to find these types of chargers since mac switched to the magnetic type its hit and miss with the working my battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
this is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around i own a  powerbook g which this is listed as being compatible withthe problem is that this isnt actually a watt power cord so dont expect to use your computer while its charging and dont expect to be able to touch the brick as its plugged in youll burn yourselfive returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a ton better.
i love it its long and the connection is secure and it doesnt get hot its wonderful.
though the output of this power supply is lower than the apple supply it seems to work fineand it is very reasonably priced too bad that amazon stopped carrying the supply.
i bought this charger near the end of may of this year and it stopped working about  weeks ago it is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord it looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on amazon it charges quite slowly ibook g  i have a brand new apple brand battery so i dont think it has anything to do with that or the computer from now on i will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead.
this product is advertised to work with the ibook g but it does notthis plug looks fine but despite what the product description stats it isnt compatible with the  to yearold version of the inch ibook g which i own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didnt workconsider yourself warned.
out of the difficult to open package this adapter worked for a couple of daysi missed the light on the end of the standard apple adapter yellow for charging green for chargedbut the price was right until it started cycling on and off the mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten boy was i glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between ac and battery unplugged the macally computer ran fine on just battery runs fine on the apple charger i had left at homethe good news is the return to amazon was extremely easy presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesnt void my refundive ordered a different brand with light this one may have just been a bad example ive had good luck with other macally gear.
this book takes a typical family examines its seperate members and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member hasi enjoy binchys style of writing interconnected stories that weave together she pulled it off first in lilac bus and now silver wedding.
despues de leer este maravilloso libro mi manera de ver la vida es muy diferente todo tiene sentido y gracias a estos conocimientos he podido ayudar a otras seres a vivir su vida con un proposito que es ser mejores cada dia para pasar de nivel en nuestro crecimiento espiritua.
i will say that the concept this book adds of playing with future is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running the most important thing about work is to get it doneif notit equals all uswe all lose that does not help a lot any organization this books deals about how to get it done self sustained and fruitfull.
i bought this book from amazon in used condition but like new little did i realize or even think about that it didnt come with the jacks and ball now i have to try to find the right size jacks not jumbo ones and a ball i guess you get what you pay for.
the thomas wooden track connector pieces is just what was needed when setting up different designs sometimes when setting up a new design my  year old grandson whould end up with no way to connect the finish these pieces have helped with that problem.
this is a very disapointing book the author makes the complexe amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at nickle mine school into one diminsional disney characters there is no tension conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real just a oh so sweet group of simple peopleof course that does not allow us to learn anything from the amish and i am sure there is a lot to be learn from themthe author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the amish there were spots where i though o please get over yourself i didnt finish the book it was a waste of time.
if you are looking for a book on amish theology history lifestyle or agricultural techniqu.
i dont advise buying this grider it broken when i pressed it the plastic is very fragile and dont support the pressure requered for grinding the pepper.
the description says you can adjust for coarseness of the saltpepper but there is no such knob on the mini grinders we replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesnt work disappointing.
statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances anyone playing in a longterm keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on the stats in this book are as good as ever as is the top prospect listthis edition falls flat in its essays in the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a  ratio this years essays are far more statitically driven and are written in a  ratio meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysisthis makes the book far dryer than usual and more of a chore to get through its still invaluable as a reference tool but as entertainment it falls a little short.
my two and half years old girl likes it so much and every i want to allure her to bed to sleep i will say read i spy in bed.
the winds of light books are great this one is no exception but i like the first  the best the only reason i gave this book a  star rating is because the other  were better i would of gave it a  if i had not read the others.
this book did not move me at all the plot is unrealistic and the characters are shallo.
is that a monarch a viceroy or a queen butterfly to identify butterflies look through the field guide to butterflies of texas the next time you can tell that it was a tiger swallowtail and not a zebra swallowtail or a spicebush swallowtailchildren are fascinated by insects and butterflies as well teach them to appreciate nature learning the names of butterflies is a good way to start.
more visually interesting than plain white and the material is definitely better for dampness than plain cotton but please dont wear them with sandals they arent that visually interestingthe bottom black part is thicker but not thick enough to pill or get natty with useyou know what i meanthick socks have a way of breaking down with wearthe uppers the white and colored part are thin stretchy and breathable flexible enough as well to pull down slightly in the rear to make them noshows if you choose.
at the height of the age of reason the united states of america was created by men such as thomas paine and many others who held man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea individual rights down on paper in the form of the constitution of the united states of america paines contribution to this end is well known paine noted in this book that we have it in our power to make the world over again and they did man has a right to his own life and there is no law above this no one has a right to another mans life not god not the race not the dictatorship not the proletariat not the great society nor the new deal thanks to thomas paine and men like him we have it in writing we own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way lets work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters to the glory of man.
i liked the way butler filled in the history of the queen mary andqueen elizabethhe also told a very good clear picture of lifewe lived aboard ship on page  second phargaph tells of a march crossing  i was on that passage and well remember hearingthe depth charges explodimgi still have my white tag and cabinwith number on d deckto verify my memory i checked my discharge and called our coplit yes he remembered hearing the depth chargesthis tolded of the vital roll these two great ships played inwinning of the warmany of these things where new to me and i was there.
well it is only for my course called fundamnetals of socal research but its very expensive indeed just wanted the first to make a comment thats all.
maxwell succeeds in creating a new way to experience leadership principles and the bible i have used this as a guide for my youth groups leadership program highshcool juniors and seniors and it has been perfect this is an excellent gift idea for anyone who has interest in leadership and believes their christain faith is critical to their approach.
i was so happy with dollys hungry again and her return to real country i like new country  but now it is just like pop music quite a few onehit wonders but dolly parton like tori amos and ani difranco two that came to mind makes an entire album of great music instead of an album that showcases two hit songs if you like folkindie music i think you will love this bluegrass album her cover of johnny cashs i still miss someone gave me chills my favorite song is definitely will he be waiting for me this is bluegrass but i definitely like a female singing it it just mellows it out dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour i couldnt be happier im  have been listening to her since i was little and have never gotten to see her perform live but this album the critics arent just praising a country hall of famer  the album deserves every wonderful word.
as a child i grew up in knoxville tn watching dolly partin on the cas walker farm  home show i remember her singing bluegrass back then and didnt really appreciate what i was hearing unfortunately she got away from her roots now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted cd that has critics and her fans screaming her praises dollys voice is perfectly suited to singing bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark the arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable as a tenneseean i wish she would have included her awesome version of rocky top or at least updated it dollys gonna give a lot of fellow artists a run for their money this year at the grammys with the grass is blue and trio ii a top  cd if i ever heard one.
as usual dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice the musicians are the only good thing about this recording shes attempting to sing country songs bluegrass style and it doesnt work.
the only reason i am giving this cd  stars instead of  is because it is too short lhasas voice is sultry sad and powerful the music is haunting yet airy perfection.
i would recommend this book to any kids who love a great adventure i was on the edge of my seat the whole way through the book i especially loved the silver knight and how he became friends with william go get this book.
this was a great and is very magical a young boys nanny is leaving and gives him a small castal as a going away present but it turns out that the night that came wthe castal is a real night that has been shrunken and turned to stone the young boy breaks the spell that an evil sorcerer has put on the night and goes back to his time to stop the wrong that the sorcerer is doing will he stop the evil sorcerer or will the evil sorcerer stop him you will find out in this incredible story of magic and adventure.
this was the worst book i have ever read in my entire life i was forced to read it for school it was complicated and very boring i would not recommend this book to anyone please dont waste your time and money to read this book read something else.
i loved this book when i was about eight years old and looking back on it its easy to see why william the main character is a gymnast just as i was whos rather shy and reserved just as i was but manages when its important to help the people around him hes immensely sympathetic and compelling and though the familiar fantasyland and evilwizardrulingafauxmedievalkingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre it surprised and excited me as a kidrereading it recently i found it didnt hold up as well as some of my favorite books from when i was younger such as madeleine lengles a ring of endless light but it holds up better than man.
good price excellent design and shipped wellwouldve been better if the vendor also provided personalized engraving.
spellbinder was the st night world book i have ever readi recomended this book to all my friendsand i recomend it to you also lj smith is a very talented writer and i plan to read all of her books to come.
i like a lot of people writing reviews play a lot of first person shooters if you liked splinter cell buy traod used i agree with everyone herestory is good controls are less than mediocre even enter the matrix blew this game away customizing the keyboard helps some but less than what i expected i tried to leave feedback for eidos but to no avail hopefully if there is another one it will be in beta for a lot longer and for those of you out there who think that it might be my pc i can assure you that is not the case.
the story is very interesting and the action and enemies are awesome but the game just has to many technical issues i think they rushed to get it on the shelves asap tech problems are my only quirk with the game.
i was so looking forward to this game being released i was on the internet on a weekly basis looking for a new release date delay after delay i bought the game the day of its release loaded it onto my computer and was ready to play i had one disappointment after another first the controls were different from her other games ok i will get use to the new ones second and the biggest controlling her is virtually impossible she is jerky sporadic and down right slow and awkward i have had to reload the game about  times to get her to do a simple maneuver i have given up many times in shear frustration frustration i havent felt in her other games i do not think i will continue playing this game it is time to move on and enjoy myself with another game which is what games are all about sorry core and eidos this could be your biggest mistake especially now that the movies are doing so well what a boost this could have been for you.
this game is the angel of darkness  the control system is impossible  the menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage  i have played all the tomb raider games  this one is near to unplayable  this thing went straight to ebay  save your money for something good  the tr people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something  jeez  the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.
this review is intended as a review of the book not of the work of edgar allan poe as a poe fan i purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading poe on my kindle however the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it while there is a table of contents the individual works are not list ther.
this would be a great book for use in elementary school science classes it has a wonderful layout with many beautiful photographs if insects can be called beautiful the text mixed nicely with the pictures covers basic information on insects as well as various interesting facts.
this is a wonderful victorianstyle novel about a manor house its mistress and her domestics wonderful that is until the middle of the story the author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story its spooky and interesting but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrators point of view time and setting make the rest of a great read a downer.
this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material might as well have been foil and the screws didnt fit well i was really disappointed in it dont buy it spend a little more and get a better one hopefully in other words poor design excuted with sub standard parts.
this is the biggest waste of money i have spent in a long time it didnt even make it through one bag of leaves i would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back cant believe amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department take my advice and save your moneyi would have given it no stars but didnt have that option in my opinion it rates  stars.
i have read enough to know when im being preached to and huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re the human condition in the island i was very disappointed since huxley has the ability to write well even about esoteric subjects see the perennial philosophy for instance but ends up just making a hash of it here not highly recommended.
it was a decent book but not a lot of new information for me for the most part it simply confirmed some basics i have long believed in  not living out your dreams through your children encouraging exploration without forcing achievement the need to provide for additional means of learning etc a lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids which really doesnt apply in small towns like we live in some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods a lot of real life examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approachprobably the most novel idea that came across was that its better to be a good enough parent than a perfect one by kleins opinion if you manage to be the perfect parent you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example not sure im  with that but it is an interesting take on parenting.
this software is not user friendly the samples dont help i would imagine that if i sat down for a few hundred hours i could figure out were the dots go the whole interface just doesnt make any sense its very time consuming total waste of  dollars at the apple store.
easy reading book which i would recommend for those who want a sort of executive summary of the story behind wright and his works having said this i found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time not for collectors unless you like myself want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view.
a bit simplistic at times but got some good discussions goingin our sunday school class methodist would recommend itfor contemporary adult sunday school classes or bible studies.
still have this works great my food is kept fresh inside the dome so has a good seal to it.
while the shipping was amazing the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems the text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out it would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource wo an instructor leading.
this is a really cool record to own my favorite muffs albums are happy birthday to me and alert today alive tomorrow so i like their later material this hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but i really like it i think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how theyve improved with time good cd.
i was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade but sadly they have not having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out now that kim is in her s youd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these outtakes from the past.
this book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages the book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came beforethe basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people places and things that you like a way to chart your course is taken from alan lakeins how to get control of time and your life which is an excellent book strategies for dealing with misteps are also coveredthe author tries overtly to avoid religion but a slight christian undertone runs through the book probably unintentionally because of the authors and those he quotes cutltural background.
i ordered two in cowboy slim cut x i already had some wranglers the waist was way too small the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way these were made in mexico just like the ones i bought at target but the badging was different a rubber badge on the back right pocket not the thin leather wrangler badge at the rear right waist were these knockoffs not sure returned them and went to target where i got two pair for  each they were original and legendary gold not cowboy but still half the price pard.
stockings are not easy to find where i live in northern california and i cannot stand to wear panty hose i decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site i used to find a garter belt i really like the stockings they are darker black than the picture depicts them i prefer offblack the lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch so if you have large thighs you might not like them the next order i will order one size larger for that reason although i do not have large thighs my husband really likes them and the fact that i like them makes him happy i will buy more.
these may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not the magnet that is glued to the back of these is about  and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder i tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator if you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger stronger magnet  these hooks will be useful otherwise they are not worth anything i guess you get what you pay for.
both of these issues among others are examined in this simple yet complex story about a variety of characters all of whom we recognizewhat lies beneath the skin of the average person what do they believe in and why what makes their worlds shatter what would make your world shatterthe author never wastes a word entertwining the characters in unlikely but believable ways its a quick read that lingers with the reader to make you think about your beliefs and what you would do for those beliefsto each individual the book could be about god or the meaning of life or simply how you fit into the world this makes the book touching on a personal level i think every reader will find a different way and reason to love this book.
i am a big belva plain fan and have always enjoyed her books after the fire is a disappointing read what bothered me the most is the character of hyacinthwhat a weak and stupid woman she is not believable at all any mother will fight to the end for her children i kept hoping she would snap out of it but she never did she just kept trusting stupid men and believing them i will think twice before spending money on another belva plain novel in the future.
i was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was i should have spent more for a better set but it will have to do for now.
dont buy this didnt even come with all the screws you could build a better set with twigs skip it.
good product got it in a timely manner does exactly what it is supposed to do not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced the tools work great and have been used a lot this winter.
i was unable to get this game to work in windows vista i inquired about a patch but did not receive a response.
