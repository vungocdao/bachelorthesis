this book really sucks it makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time ray should have had better things to do.
this book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring the author has a good idea we should read instead of watching tv but if this book is one of the choices you had better turn the tv back on i mean who in his right mind would ever write a book with  wall tvs robot dogs and burning books and the story never really had an ending it just stopped i guess to end the boredom i think the author had to get some sort of deal with all the teachers to assign this book how else would it get on the required reading list maybe he gives  of the profits from sales please dont buy this book you are supporting a lunatic.
i just can say i love this album for the simple reason it is the first one and never equaled in sound elegance quality essence delicate sadness and youth it is incomparable and it deserves to be listen by good and pacient tastes in post xx century pop musici do recomended.
this is very interesting film that is really five stories in one a dead girl is found and each story is effected by this in one way or another a great cast and honest dialogue make this one well worth your time the film is ultimately sad and depressing but each story is very interesting with a cast featuring toni collette giovanni ribisi piper laurie and many other talents how can you go wrong.
product is great works like its supposed to order processing and shipment speedy and efficient.
yep motorola knows how to make an automobile power cord has a convenient on off light that youll never miss its big and bright.
i purchased this product with skepticism because it was so inexpensivethe auto car charger is constructed well and seems to be made with good materials i have used it for a month and it charges the phone as expected this is how much an auto adapter should cost and not the ridiculous price that motorola and its resellers charge.
it works thats the best i can say about it the outer insulating cover has started to wear off in many places exposing wire after only a month my phone is telling me that i am using an unauthorized charger so no this was not a good purchase and i do not trust the source.
this game is horrible the battles are so long slow and unexciting the scenery is cute but alittle dark for gbadont waste your money.
this game is hard and i still havnt beaten it and i have had it for two mothes i reconmend for only skilled players playdelta thanks for youre time and patience.
this game is boring you cant follow the story line and if i hadnt read the books i would not understand it at all the fight scenes take too long and they are also boring in the mines of moria there is this one place where you have to go but you get stuck because the game has a bug the controls are extremely weird and take a long time to get used to i have bought this game and i do not like it i would suggest not buying it.
yes this has good graphics yes it has a kind of zelda theme but really if your looking for a game that fits the lord of the rings best then get the two towers once you are used to that then get the the return of the king that is the best game of them all ive played all three and the fellowship is by far the worst game i have  please gameboy dont let vivendi universal the makers of this game ever make a game based on a film ever again they wasted away all the good parts of the books and if you want to fight on this game then good luck to you do not buy this its a waste of money .
i have read the book and enjoyed it it is not one of my favorites but it fills in some of the story line i will be rereading the book i have all of the floating outfit series and am in the process of reading them in order instead of how i purchase them.
i wont go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis after the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing annie starts out as a strong quirky individual by midbook shes so hung up on jake that she looses her charm and strength of character jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy the secondary characters problems just brought the book down further that and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well once again a female character meltspun intended i guess i had anticipated stronger female and male characters the ones i get from  i think ms wells shows promise but the next book ill get from the library.
i was laughing so hard when i was reading this that i kept waking him up i then tried not laughing and my body was shaking so much that that woke him upthis is a wonderfully funny book and i hope to read more books by robin wells.
i recently purchased this case and tested it at depths up to  feet in bonaire it was easy to open and close and there was no possiblity of having it only partially closed the controls operated all the cameras functions there was no leakage or fogging this case absolutely works as advertised.
just throw them away after  hours i assume these are plastic so folks after  hours they are obsolete and throw them out to create more useless landfill trash that will last  millenia yay hooray.
my rating is for amazon not the product i placed this order and just received a mail that it is not available why is the availability not updated i still see it being available now very disappointing.
movies are okay but the video quality is pooris this a legit dvd or black marketthey are watchablebut grainyi guess you get what you pay for.
as one would expect these producrions are beautifully presented the quality of the acting is superb england seems to produce character actors of great skill and presence i thoroughly enjoyed the variety of themes presented.
ah colin firththe ultimate consumate actor in a variety of roles a delightful diet of filmsone a day plus a bonus for the weekend and one can have a film festival all their own.
excellent classic style movies all well acted with excellent stars will watch over again many timescolin firth is one of my favorites.
this is the only film i have watched so far this is not up to the usual british cinema quality either in acting or content i didnt watch to the end once he found himself tied up in bed i turned it off.
paying about  for this collection of  films could have been a great buy i have traveled to uk enough to know that the british people are generally quite polite polished reserved and mannered with the exception of the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain the only redeeming film in this collectio.
you would have no idea reading the description and looking at the picture on the front but most of these movies have a rating of pg and theres even an rthey are mostly about sex sensuality and the likeyuck i bought this because my daughter likes the historical movies like pride  prejudice and emma etcthese are not the same i threw the set away without even opening it the ratings are on the back they should be written on the page.
considering the price of this card its hard to be disappointed i installed it into my freshly built system using a full version of windows xp as i write this i am watching an old episode of star trek tng on a small screen on top of aol the capture feature works great and the the additional goodiesfrom cables to a nice remote controller are exceptional i never use the enclosed driver disk with new hardware and the dv was no exception there is not any reason not to download the newest drivers for the initial install i have found it reduces many hassles speaking of hassles i have had none with this card windows xp is such an improvement for handling complex components like the dv i would recommend it over hassling over a maxed out win  system this card costs about the same as a prime d gaming card it provides dramatic capabilities ati has really done a great job with this card for the priceit cannot be beat.
as the other reviews noted there are problems with installing this card even though i got it working successfully in the end although it isnt my top pick for a graphics card i have enjoyed being able to hook it up to my vcr and print my digital videos to vhs yes this is possible although it is a bit tricky to setupi withhold one star on this card for having lack of customer support and being hard to setup if the user manual would have been more comprehensive and if the ati website would have had more help on the subject of installing this card the whole nasty ordeal of card setup that almost all night might have been spared.
certain songs from naglfar are without a doubt outstanding esp th rising brimstone gate but the songs off of vittra all sound similar i cant really decipher between them most of the riffs arent capturing it is hard to find the cd diabolical which has the songs i mentioned above but already i can tell you that cd is better than vittra.
a good childrens book excellent for reading to preschool aged children the text can easily be understood by the  and  year olds in my library story hour as they identify with louie and his most favorite stuffed animal a red goose the illustrations are great.
i was new to guanajuato and enjoyed the parts of the book the discuss the city but the story line was trite even contrived the culinary part of the mystery included recipes that while tasty are hardly gourmet  they mostly consisted of things made with campbells soup not one that i recall was indigenous to mexico at least it was a quick read.
joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus ulysses did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in thus it was that the artist while composing his next work finnegans wake got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys a poignant expression obviously of the searing torment boiling within himhappily for us the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume.
what secondtonone myther rector and maximost bridgesmaker was the first to rise taller through his beanstale than thebluegum buaboababbaun or the giganteous wellingtonia sequoi.
ye make a book alas how is life green bay packers sandwich baby eat the president lakelike that prose that is james joyce the king of gibberish i made it up but when he does it it is a classic when i do gibberish it is not whywhat the hell is going on with finnegans wake i dont knowjoyce must be the genious of gibberishi dont get it.
admirers of this glimpse into madness must have a great need to feel smug and superior such intellectuals are painfully desperate and afraid of realit.
that was how english novelist evelyn waugh descibed joyce when he came to write fw and the judgment is apt the book itself is trip.
i give this book two stars because its the first and last book to tell us what we already should knowthat we think gibberish in that ethereal state between waking and sleep finningans wake reminds me of the canvas ive seen at countless art shows with a jumble of random splatterings of paint any one of us could create the same thing why dont we joyce is challenging us to get off our duffs and splatter some paint on the canvass if you think its worthwhile personally i dont do it you could be the next james joyce.
nietzsche is not fed up with christianity he is fed up with christians and the people who distort christianity nietzsche is not the antichrist he is simply the messenger in a greek tragedy we are the antichristin reality there has been ofnly one christian and he died on the cross the evangel died on the cross what was called evangel from that moment on was already the oposite of what he had livedantichrist five stars for nietzsche three for the lack of notes also there are many times when nietzsche writes in french or latin and there is no note or translationps im older than twelve.
it is a birthday present for my granddaughter and has not been opened yet it appears to be as promised and both girls will benefit from it.
from a female hardcore lovers point of view i have just got to say that hatebreed is amazing by far one of the best hardcore albums ive heard in a while this album is full of raw true emotion  it makes me aware of where i am with myself as well as with others hatebreed goes further than just delivering a simple hardcore sound  they truly give it in a way that makes me feel the music it has the ability to take one to the emotional edge and back i would love to thank the band personally for creating and sharing thier sound with othersand for inspiring me.
its interesting that hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of slipknot or limp bizkit when they now tour with bands like that its also interesting in light of the fact that their music is basically identical to any alternametal bands except without what little talent or melody those bands possess this band has as much to do with hardcore as sepultura i thought this was a joke band when i heard it f youre really interested in hardcore put down that jug of weight gainer  turn off your victory sampler cd and order a universal order of armadgeddon cd immediately and stop wearing so much adidas newjack.
hatebreed album satifaction is the death of desire has to be one of the all time best albums i have ever heard i list to a lot of hardcore and and this album never comes out of my disc changer if you are looking for strong lyrics strong music and an awsome groove that you and your friends can kill each other to buy this and never stop listening to it.
the beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get van damme to the foreign legion where the real story and action begins right unfortunately the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies at least van damme didnt do the splits in this movie then again that might have given the film a memorable momement.
i had bought one of these for my old dog a large german shorthaired pointer who had a horrible pulling problem and it worked perfectly for him and he didnt seem to mind on the other hand i just bought one of these for my  month old coonhound and it also worked to stop his pulling but he hates it i cant take him for a walk without him trying to get it off atleast  times i think this may just be because he loves to sniff the ground so much that this kind of makes his head go higher up but now i have to order him something else to stop his pulling because of what difficulty it is to use this for him other than that amazing product in its self.
this is probably a good product for dogs with square jaw lines but for owners of small dogs such as a lhasa apso or shitzu beware because of their flatter facial structures the collar slips off and wont hold as it should and speaking from experience the size is not the issue ie even a small size wont work.
this game is so cool i have only played it once and already i would like to purchase it it has coloring puzzling and even adventures the only time that i ave played was when i was going to a dna lab and i had my gba with a notsofun game so somebody let me play the wild thornberrys movie game and now i would like to purchase it once again to say that.
i am sure the story is fine but the disk is imperfect lost my packing slip and need to call to return it.
the story is without a bunchline and not as good as the others stargates that i have bought.
movie was awsome they did bring back general oneill wich i am really happy about that my only problem with the movie was richerd dean andersons character wasent showed enough.
as a loyal fan of the stargate franchise since the very first moviei applaud the actors writers and producersdirector for a job well doneit still takes some getting used to a featurelength movie vs made for television.
i am pretty happy with installment  out of the  that were promised i have been to a few conventions and have shaken hands with most of the stars but i have a ways to go yet and so do they i am anxiously awaiting the next one.
i hope well see more of this mini movies though it seems for a story like that a  hours movie could have been better yet its a fantastic storyline exploring new ways allowing us however to see all of our favorite teams seens over the years while the show was on.
the entertainament quality is above the average of the series sg i think this film reached the quality level of stargate atlantis.
length  minsthis is my video review of stargate continuum for more video reviews search mikepetel on youtube enjoy.
i like all the stargates but this one and ark of truth are way to grainy they look better on standard dvd other then that its another great stargate film.
this rice cooker is good for one time cooking the rice does not last more than  hours i usually leave my rice for  days so that i do not have to keep cooking it lazy i returned it and bought cukoo rice cooker made in korea the rice lasts for  days without changing color or get old cukoo is more expensive but it will last for years.
 the intro soulstar youloveme which should have been the first single not forthenight somewhere between momentinlife and thereasonotherwise a less than stellar album.
i love musiq  even when he had the soulchild dont get me wrong all the songs arent hits but for the most part he is doing his thing on this album cut my man a break he is trying and i look forward to his new album i love his voice his music and him in general the tracks that are my favs areinfatueightieswhoknowsforthenightyouknowyoulovememomentinlifewomanopolybuy borrowfrom a friend or library this cd its mellow like the way neosoul is supposed to betoodles.
at first i didnt really care for this album but after a couple of listens i love it neosoul is here to stay and musiq is the greatest my favorite tracks are womanopoly babymother who knows and so on this cd is hot and i cant wait for the next one.
this is the kind of book where you realize early on that the writer isnt talented enough to pull off what shes set out to do sad since i was looking forward to reading this based on the jacket copy oh well this reviewer recommends that others look elsewhere for a compelling read.
this is without a doubt one of the all time best films i have ever seen if you are thinking about buying it just do so you will not be disapointed.
this is your bagif you like action fun stunts thrillif you want to see something completely uniqueif you are not afraid of timeblendsif you like fabulous music from some of the hippest german people that make look the far too streamlined usual scores look veeeery oldif you like cartoonsif you like to rather sit and hold than to stop the vcr and go to toiletif you like to experience sheer speedso what are you waiting for run to get itone funny sidenote the movies rating was for  years in germany americans are really funny with their prudery it seems that the americans are as afraid of sex as the germans are of violence.
this movie is simply the best i have ever seen i am very into film but this is simply great because of its wonderful story line a great art direction and wonderful camera workall out amovieeveryone should have it.
actually this isnt really even a movie its a really long music video maybe its an advertisement i dont know all i can say is that a good movie requires a few things first and foremost an engaging story and some interesting characters this film lacks both the director is a trickster of sorts who depends on neat stylized filming techniques and devices that attempt to cover up the fact that nothings really happening plotwise sorry but the alternatescenario theme just didnt work at the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds maybe i missed the point is there a point somebody please enlighten me.
this movie left me on the edge of my seat and short of breath once just wasnt enough in the theater i just had to see it again on the big screen i never used to be into movies with subtitles but the effect just isnt the same as it is in its native tongue just when i thought its over it just takes you on another turn and another and another if you like fast paced unpredictable action with a soundtrack that fits its movie like a glove this ones for you.
this product is palatable and seems to work well with my bichon who injured her knee in a tussle with my younger bichon the joint works well and she seems to not have anymore pain i recommend this product.
relly quick action you can play tag here is how to play tag youhave to tag all the othere cars wethowt being tagd in reternbatell is a chalinging game you fite you can race to.
i am sorry but after reading this book i have to admit that the feminists are right men are pigs and the only reason this book was written was for the authors to make moneythe book tries to justify its existance by saying it is designed to help you find the love of your life on the internet it actually only helps you find the love of your night if i had actually used any of the tips in the book i would have had alot of sex but i doubt finding my soulmate would have been possible in fact i doubt anyone using this tips would find their ultimate mate it would be inspite of the tips not because of theman entire chapter is devoted to sterotyping women though the authors do try to explain most women do not meet these types then the list over  to watch out fori am glad i did not actually pay for this i would have demanded my money back.
this album is brilliant if you buy it i guarantee itll be the best album you buy all year.
this was a very disappointing purchase the premium hand decorated exotic wooden tea chest appears to be pine decorated with printed paper although the print is very nice the description of it is a bit overblownthe tea inside was okay some of the combinations of flavors just didnt go well together and often drowned the flavor of the tea.
my cable was out and i missed my favorite shows thank goodness for amazon where i could watch them and not worry about viruses or signing up for a monthly fee thanks.
this is an easy reading but profound story of what children can do to change the prejudices of their elders.
this cd is not touch sampler  which has not yet been released this is touch sampler  released to commemorate the millenium its a nice cd and the track listing is right but the product title is incorrect see .
i cant imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box  its tones are set in a specific pattern and it doesnt deviate from that at all but colleen somehow makes music boxes magical again by mixing the traditional plucked sounds with their reprocessed and synthesized counterparts she manages to evoke a fairy tale mysticism whats is a componium part  goes from thick sonics to singular tones at the end and even it charless birthday card relies solely on iterations of pop goes the weasel will you gamelan for me is its own creation immediately the tinkling comes fast and furious on whats is a componium part  a track that sparkles like moondust calypso in a box shows off the more processed side and has an almost senor coconut feel for its short running time the standout piece here is the final track ill read you a story which appeared on an earlier album but is always welcome anywhere.
i knew nothing of robert mcduffie until i heard him perform the mendelssohn concerto at wolf trap with the national symphony that performance led me to seek out this cd and mcduffies playing here is as lovely on the disc as it was in the live performance his tone may not be as big as itzhak perlmans but it is nevertheless exquisite the phrase spun silver though cliched is apt this is true concerto playing the soloist carrying on a conversation with the orchestra and by extension with the listener i definitely will seek out more of mcduffies discs and i hope others will too.
first off let me help you novices out there a little bit dont buy a video card because of its price its hype or its look do your research this card is excellent it is blazingly fast it beats geforce  and it is a steal bra key feature in the radeon  is the programmable pixel shaders let me tell you a little more about them geforce   and radeon  all share them witht he exception with the geforce  mx the newest games will use programmable pixel shaders and if you dont have a video card that uses this then you cant play it the radeon beats its competition while being half the price but be cautious because there has been driver issues with ati and what seems to be cheating driversprosblazingly fastcomes from a respectable companyexcellent image qualityconsdriver issues.
this movie personifies everything that is wrong with hollywood these days the characters are superficial the plot anemic and the special effects vastly overused liam neeson leads a cast of characters who spend a few days in a haunted house to gauge their fear reaction the house is possessed by the spirit of its builder who hates kids that is about it a terrible remake of the original  classic which was the best horror film ever made get the original and save your bucks by letting this one sit in the warehouse and rot.
okay if youre a special effects freak you might like this however there are much better films with equally good effects if youre a fan of minor things like say oh plot character development etc then stay away the  robert wise film is the scariest film ive ever seen and the scares come from what wise doesnt show you the  version was brilliantly plotted and paced with one of the greatest ending lines in film history the  version has none of this do yourself a favor and see the  movie or better yet read the shirley jackson novel the only reason this gets one star is because c zetajones is just so easy on the eyes.
a truly horrible horror film over use of not so special special effects attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum and that the characters were never developed or interesting the only thing thats scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after  years the other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that i actually paid to see it.
ill admit it was years ago when i had seen part of this movie remake that was so bad so corny so awfully unscary that i couldnt even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through and i a lover of all things spooky i do recall however three things about this movie the directing was awful the script was terrible and cathy jones i didnt know who she was  she hadnt married the old man yet which really launched her career gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie no i speak in haste  there were a number of worst things about this movieif you want to be creepedout read the book the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson if you must see the story in movie form watch the old black and white original from  starring julie harris its dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigohappy hauntingnesswind in hare.
is the house on haunted hill so different than the haunting both share the same failure a great old story that can be pictured every year and still make a good thriller but this movie makes it no better than a poor picturegood actors good story but not well told with its poor suspense the old classic movies with their limited graphics were much more successful.
if you like supernatural mysteries then youd like this film it is technically a horror film but its really not that frightening though there is a scene in the movie that made my mother jump about three feet and as a result is not for people that watch horror films for the fright as a mystery however it is really quite good and deserves to be watched over and over just so you can find all the hidden clues for the answer at the end.
no no no what went wrong bigbudget film with great actors and what do we get a visually appealing film with a completely flat liam neeson and a paperthin storyline catherine zeta jones tries to charm her way through but even though she does an okay job the movie is still bad lili taylor and owen wilson also try to add flavour to it all but cannot manage to save the day all we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content it all seems to be over before it really begins and nothing really makes much sense and the eerie mood is almost totally absent not a good omen for a horror movie is iti just cant believe what went wrong for neeson usually he drags a movie up not down watch house on haunted hill instead if youre into stuffsomepeopleintoahauntedhouseandseeifthesurvive movies then youll se how a proper haunting should be .
sad sad sadthe waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs catherine zetajones is a much higher caliber actress along with liam neesons lame attempts to make this movie palatable is such a crime almost as if the movies set was hauntedthe beginning of the movie has so much promise  you feel the backround of the centralized story has promise you get suckered into the premise this house has to offer  then and without warning the silliness beginsit is as if youve been thrown into an addams family reunion  the story line starts to wander the characters continue to wander and ideas and solutions popup without a warning or explanationto say a horror movie isnt believable almost sounds absurd but this movie gets you suckered in then throws you on the floor flatthis is a definite  do not buy borrow or rent just wait for cable.
the actors in the movie are a great bunch but when the plot is very weak you dont get very much i mean liam neeson hes a great actor but was very weak in this movie it wasnt scary at all the the end of the movie was bad there was maybe one scary part which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump that was all i dont recommend this movie to people who like scary movies bc it was a polar opposite.
a fan of both jacksons novel and the  robert wise adadptation i went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming it was worse in fact it was so bad i laughed my way through it along with the two friends who accompanied me there are so many digital effects that the house seems alive indeed but computer geeks set free with a big budget dont creep me out theyre just annoying so is the movie the house shapeshifts sighs moanshell even the doorknocker gets a reaction shot zetajoness leather hipboots manage to outact her and lili taylor is hilariously bad as eleanor ive got the save the children wha liam neeson is even less interesting than he was in the phantom menace if thats possible lets just put it this way i just sacrificed  minutes of my time to write this review so that you wont waste  hour and  minutes of yours on this film.
third grade mentality thirdrate dialog not for adults egads i actually bought the dvd shame on me.
this is the worst film of all time the only amusement came from making fun of the acting how they got liam neeson and zeta jones to be in this movie is incredible i was looking forward to bathroom breaks so i would miss some of this movie total poop.
the haunting with julie harris was so goodeven better for its black and white medium which enhances the sense of the macabre and general offkilterness of the set why dont they remake the wizard of oz now theres a picture that could be made much pertier with modern cinematography the cheap set and old theatrestyle acting throw a damper on whats still is a great universal story.
this overdone remake of the brilliant  classic is sorely disappointing if it had been released as an original movie with an original title it would have worked the special effects though good were too much for this movie to bare.
this  horror film based on the original the haunting is creepy in some ways but altogether its not really a great film at all it has good acting and the scares and popouts are clever things that boost my rating from a  to a  with an ending that isnt perfect but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart the film moves slow in the beginning and it starts to pick the pace soon after and later has its intense ending the film is ok in some ways but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win but it still isnt horrible i liked the house and the setting though that was cool the complete storyline was pretty good also if you want some innovative horror from  i suggest you get the blair witch project.
i was originally looking forward to seeing this movie but after i did i wish i hadnt spent the money the story is lame the actors dull and the story is so changed from shirley jacksons wonderful book and the  movie that it doesnt even deserve to share the same title forget about buying this botched movie and purchase the older haunting youll wonder why they bothered to make a remake proving that newer doesnt necessarily mean better.
the seat was a cinch to install it took about  minutes tops and its a lot more comfortable than the factory seat the bike came with.
i bought this book and alamut when was in high school and lost them years ago i was so happy to have it to download and read again on my kindle.
our almost year old son knows nearly every word of this album by heart our month old perks up when ralph is on and we parents hum the tunes and enjoy the smart lyrics  even though we hear this music daily  the music is rich and doesnt go stale and manages to bridge the generation gap.
i ordered this bag without any knowledge of how big it was i wanted to use it for a wkend trip i was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was i have a  month old baby girl and it was way too small for me to carry all of her things in it i was only able to fit a few diapers and wipes and the other small items i wasnt even able to fit a change of clothes i tried putting a change of her clothes in the back pocket but it made it way too bulky all in all the bag was adorable but way too small for a newborn i wouldnt recommend this bag to any mother with a newborn baby.
book is packaged properly so it is not easy to tamper with it great that it comes with a cd.
this book is great for anyone having trouble taking the asvab for the first time my daughters score improved tremendously.
studied the asvab few days before taking the test this book helped me get an idea of the difficulty and what to expect in the test the practice tests on this book is actually harder than the actual asvab so it helped me to study harder versions passed with a score of .
the composers of these songs were almost all born in the second half of the th century their attempt was to create an american music from native american sources of rhythm and tonality i get the same sense of hearing original music with these songs as i got the first time i heard erik satie the songs tend to be melodic and peaceful and fresh dont expect much in the way of tomtoms and movie indian harmonies i love to find songs that go to unexpected places i found that herefor a much more sophisticated review search american indianists and fred flaxman.
while i loved both movies jean de florette and the sequel manon of the spring i would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second they are both masterfully done and you really cant watch just one of them as they are an inseparable pair the first movie forming the background for the second and the second providing the resolution for the first without giving up too much of the story these movies tell a story of greed accidental murder and resolution with the likes of greek tragedycritically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime my only criticism of the nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision overall this flaw can be overlooked as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come.
this is the second part of a two part series and picks up where jean de florette leaves off if you do not see jean de florette then you will be missing much of the background of this movie and the context is important for example without viewing the first movie the viewer will not know manons background what happened to her father and their farm the viewer will also not know the full relationship she has with the soubeyran clanthe quality of the dvd picture is avarage the picture is fairly clean and clear.
i bought a simpletech compactfalsh card of mb to use with my digital camera minolta dimage i but it does not work  the card works fine on my pc but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam i guess simpletech must be aware of the problem since their tech support emailed me that they would post a patch on their website as soon as they would find one but of course i had no clue of the compatibility issue before buying the card so i hope this might help some potential buyers.
its very simple everything i have ever owned by simpletech has died on me including this drive  usb sticks  sd cards and  cf card not one of their products lasted me more than  years and caused me a lot of headache.
i can still remember the force with which the first two or three paragraphs hit me reading them in a bookstore in albuquerque inventive humane human magical.
i have read this book in both spanish and english i believe it is simply the best novel written in the th century no where else does a book burn with the fires of imagination and dreams like this one it touches my soul with a something magical creating the world of the buendias inside of me someone once said finishing the book is like waking from a dream i agree.
before reading this booki had never realized that a book could be a piece of art as easily as a painting this book is akin to beauty bound in pages it is utterly amazing i personally do not understand why people say it is difficult to understand and even more difficult to get through i couldnt put it down it simple spoke to me rules to follow while reading this  pay attention and savor and  open your mind.
gracias a este libro recien llegamos a descubrir que toda la humanidad habito en algun momento en macondo olvidensen de las grandes civilizaciones del pasado este pueblo perdido lo abarca todo amor odio guerras y los buendia son como cualquier ser humano de este planeta esta novela son de las que se leen de un tiron no importa que afuera pase un viento huracanado como el que destruye al pueblo al final al cerrar la ultima pagina todos llevamos algo de macondo dentro de nosotros.
i only made it to  pages the book is just boring a lot of sound and fury signifying very little there are marriage.
marquez book takes the reader through the lives and times of what i hope is an atypical columbian  family covering from roughly the s to the s it was fun in parts but oddly repetitive with a style that seemed half magic realism half freud and of course the standard enervating antiamerican diatribes were thrown in i guess a latin american author even in magic realism mode cant overcome his predilictions.
the first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history its enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages unfortunately the book becomes one of the most overrated in historymany of the praises given say the book is difficult confusing and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book why why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good this is a parable with many characters magic realism a genre that deserves to be ignored though thats another discussion to give marquez credit his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under but it is nevertheless a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful and the intertwining of lives but they just dont move the story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all aboutmarquez book about miguel litton and news of a kidnapping are much better but this book just bores and bores.
this book changed me  it changed the way i look at things  the way i observe all the events in my life it wasnt easy to read at the beginning  but this book helped me get rid of depression writing the characters names with a brief about each of thm will help you alot.
this was my first encounter with the magical realism style and i love it the buendia family is quite possibly the most intriguing i have encountered in any book a must read.
im one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so i plugged away hoping id experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have foundbut i just didnt get it maybe it lost something in the translation but i prefer a little dialog in my fictioneven in my heavy pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction i dont mind the magic realism but i do get bored with sentences that run on for twoplus pages without a period oh well chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck whos educated beyond his intelligence but i was underwhelmed.
i read one hudred years of solitude like  times over the years and it still holds its magic and atmosphyre just an unbelievable classic it feels weary and long at moments also distracting at moments but its originality and magical ventures arise and fill the soul must have.
i have read this book  times and i can read it  times more and never get tired of it this is what a great piece of literture can do this book has such unforgetable scenes that one cannot differenciate between dream and reality that exists in the story but takes over your mind and dont let go till you set aside the book and even after you will be captivated by the imagineray that has gone into this masterpiece.
i approached this novel with reluctance a friend recommended it but said it was best to read it in the original spanish i dont understand spanish but i decided to try the english translation i was overwhelmed for days i was in a trance i could not and did not want to pull myself away from macondo and the buendia family the words hypnotized me the scenes evoked haunted me during the day and filled my dreams at night gabriel garcia marquez has created a masterpiece in any language.
as i opened this book i thought to myself wow this seems like a great story i found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page although the style and marquez technique are unquestionably wonderful the overlaying themes of lust lack of selfcontrol and immorality outweighed the good the goal of nearly very characters life is the sam.
this is what i think my problem is i didnt like the translation of the book if the novel was written in spanish and then translated into english i would sit there and say to myself that i loved the descriptive but not the flow of the sentence i am compelled to give this novel another try based on these reviews it has been a few years and i feel it is well deserving.
this translation of marquezs quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose the clarity and depth of hundred years symbolism and the excellent development of the buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time  a time of exploration political upheaval and social transition one criticism of this translation is the absence of footnotes to specific historical cultural or social elements of life in colombia in the past two centuriestaciturn silent insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house colonel aureliano buendia could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude p overall a great read.
this card has to be the bast purchase ive ever made the grapghics are great its directx supported a biggie and is far superior to most cards of the same price the reviewer who says it doesnt work obviously knows nothing about computers to know well enough whether his motherboard will work with the card if he bought the agp card maybe he should try the pci anyway this is a great video card from a great company for a great price buy it.
the whole city watch series is just about my favorite bunch of books i have ever read i almost have to read them alonme because i get the whole family looking askingly when i laugh out loud great stories obvious.
i nearly cried when i realized that this was an abridged version there is no indication in the record i was really looking forward to these cds.
carrot vimes colon nobbs are back with also alot of new recruitsangua detritus and cuddy what is the mysterious thing killing dwarfs clowns and assasins is vimes finally going to get married who knows.
i purchased this item for my son and it did not work right out of the box i followed all the terrible instructions and it still did not work i went to the coby website for answers and there was nothing there either i then attempted over  tiems to contact coby via telephone and was never able to get through i finally returned the product for a different bran i strongly suggest buying something else with a longer battery life and much better support and documentation.
this is one of my favorite shows i have contacted sony for a release date but i cant seem to get a difinitive answer this has been out for almost  years please post a response if anyone knows what to do or who to contact to request the other seasons be released ill sign a petition if that will helplw.
i was looking for a wellstructured sideby side version of the canterbury tales bantam classics normally does a great jobs on books but whoever transcribed it to kindle did not know kindle at all left it unstructured and the translation all over the place intermingled with the lines translating the wrong verses and generally just all over the placepractically i am reading four lines middleenglish five lines modern three lines middleenglish  lines modern  lines middleenglish and so forth there is no connection between the middleenglish and its translationthat was a wasted  usd for kindle version and a huge disappointment  .
beware of editions by general books llcthey produce books by scanning ocr copyrightfree material but without any editingthere are so many errors though that the result may be unusableusability probably depends on subject matter but the many ocrerrors make even prose an annoying readespecially mathematical and technical texts and texts with notes can become completely garbledsee the review of jm keynes a treatise on probability on this site which i bought but is useless and similar comments by other buyers on vanity fair by thackera.
the content  introductory notes translation  is great this is one of my favourite adaptations of the canterbury tales into modern englishthe kindle version however complete ruins the book the printed version presents facingpage translation which works great the kindle version attempts to do that having one page after the other not considering that due to the fontsize adaptability this doesnt work at all.
why did i think this rendition of the cantebury tales was translated into modern english it is the second of three items purchased from amazon and a second disappointment perhaps i should not shop online regardless it is a classic and i suspect not read by nearly as many who would enjoy it.
this translation allows you to read the stories which often are in poetry with pleasure i found the stories to be earthy funny but sometimes sad.
it is so incredibly disappointing that when such a fine film is released on dvd that the audio would be out of synch does anyone know if this an inherent problem with all the pressings.
im always up for another look at the titanic especially if new light is shed on the story unfortunately pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of ballards expeditions on top of that its not interesting the retelling of the events on the ship are fine but they cant carry the deadweight of pelligrinos attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story its the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting pass.
jenna reid has produced a debut solo cd of sheer quality from start to finish this young woman is such a stunning live performer its a joy to see she has produced an equally impressive studio recording stripped bare of over production lets her talent be heard fiddle playing of the highest order.
i really enjoy this album and the level of playing is admirable there is a good range of tunes which fit together well as a whole i think i listened to it about  times in a row when i first got it.
the usual girl goes to the big city cliches not as bad as what youd expect from mr bruckheimer thanks to the lovely and charismatic ms perabo and a nice performance from mr goodman as dadstill a gal who aspires to write songs and has absolutely nothing to say that whole whitneymariah thing yecchthe bar scenes have a certain energy to em but the other coyotes apparently have no hopes and dreams or personalitiesheres hoping the adorable piper will get a great or even better movie in the near future i will definitely be following her career.
this is a really good cheesy movie that girls and guys will both like however if your boyfriend doesnt like these types of movies then put in the unrated version in the regular version the kissingsex scene doesnt show anything but the unrated version shows lots of skin and is pretty steamy its definitely a cutesy movie but the eye candy and bar scenes will keep the guys watching piper perabo and the rest of the girls wont disappoint i promise.
i bought this movie because i love jerry bruckheimer movies i should have just rented it the only entertaining part of this movie was the bar scenes all of which were shown in the trailer that about sums up the good scenes when i watched the featurette about how hard they were looking for a lead actress and how excited they were to find piper perabo i couldnt believe it perabos acting was so annoying she ruined the whole movie for me her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded i just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling im one of those people who like all kinds of movies even some really bad ones but this is one that i dont think i will be watching again.
this movie is so dumb how dumb is it this movie is so dumb that even though it has a bunch of hot chicks dancing around in sexy clothes provocatively it is anything but sexy and provocative dumb dumb dumbdid i mention that it stunk too.
this movie is one of the worst ive seen in the past year right there with the whole nine yards and cruel intentions the plot is predictable the actors worthless or maybe the plot just wasnt any good and theres really no good reason to watch it see if this movie were at least rated r and they actually showed some ta instead of just hinting at it maybe thered be a reason to watch this movie what with all the hotties in it however bad dialogue combined with predictable plot bad performances by actors and hotties but no nudity makes for a totally worthless movie what a waste of my time.
i love this moviei watched it the first time with my best friend and then realized that i had to have a copy of it because its such a great movie.
i bought this cd initialey by mistake i was in a hurry and missed the cd i wanted right next to it it must have been gods hand directing me to this stunning album i had only heard the band on the radio and by the time song one was over i was hooked i sat there and let shirley mansons rich voice enthrall me through the rest of the cd i went out immeadiately and found their first cd which was just as good but in a different way that is what makes this a great band among other things the ability to reinvent without loosing the soulsound of the musictwo great albums i can only hope that they grace us all with many more.
this cd is even better than the first and if u are thinking about getting it my advice is to go buy it go spend a measly  bucks to get it its well worth the money.
its amazing how this sounds very odd the first time around you hear it then slowly it just hits you and you cant stop listening to it also this cd is sorta more insane literaly than the first one and its abit more slow paced rocks get it also this is the cd that got me nuts about garbage too.
garbage rocks shirley manson has a uniqe voice which is great the music for this record are very expressive and the tunes are very singable.
i bought garbages first album first and i thought the album was great boasting good tracks like milk queer only happy when it rains but the sophomore album was even better temptation waits started out with mansons menacing voice with simplistic lyrics like i tell you something i am a wolf but i like to wear sheeps clothing the second track had a rockier edge to it and then slowed down with medication and then it was fun all the way till you look so fine which ended the album with a sombre note like how garbage ended its first title with milka great buy almost perfection  you will just repeat it again and again without losing interest.
garbage is a band like no other you really have to take a listen to this amazing band to realize how one incorporates so many styles into one little albumthis album is packed full of classic garbage songs that can really give you the chills the opening track temptation waits was very eerie the first time i heard it and i loved it the next track i think im paranoid has that heavy bass and light vocals that the band is known for love the lyrics tooa great album for anyone looking to continue digging thru garbage a word of advice thoughdont bother with beautifulgarbage if you are a rock fandefienatley not impressive.
garbage deliver more terrific eurotrash rock on their second album s version  another mix of crunching guitars wild beats groovy keyboards  effects and the sensual voice of shirley manson the band are still the frontrunners of modern rock with such great rockin tracks as temptation waits i think im paranoid push it and my personal fave sleep together theres also playful poprock with special with shirley tipping her hat to the pretenders chrissie hynde at the end the delirious hammering in my head and the truly gorgeous you look so fine fabulous music  production from a fabulous band version  is essential garbage.
been watching this show on dvd since i got it it made me even make want to get season  in the store which i did its a great show one of my fav shows.
after reciving the th season set and it would not worki made a short phone call and had a replacement the very next daywow what servicemy granddaughter also thanks you.
disregard stories about how hellman cooked up this story and then passed it off as true or about redgraves protest at the oscars both apparently true certainly the second one is just see this movie because its simply one of the best movies and stories of all time the script and acting are both topnotch.
if you like jane fonda or vannassa redgrave youll like this moviethe content is dark but considering its wwii that wont be a surprise the movie is touchingsadand in someways makes you feel nice about love and friendship and in another way makes us wonder how far wed go in the name of friendship.
dvd arrived quickly and safely  good srvice would use these folk again no problems encounteredfirst saw this film in the early s at a seaside picture plcae on the east coast of england bridlington was charmed by thew story and the actors loved the moody scenery the dvd reflected the original perfectly and was most enjoyable.
i bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell but i was sadly mistaken when i got halfway through it and i kept hitting glich after glich i thought it was my xbox but i took it to a friends and glich after glich i guess i got the worst game in history but thats what happens when you get a massed produced game like this one.
what a great video i just received it and went through the routine the flow was wonderful i am not a surfer have never surfed i was just looking for a good video and everybody recommended this to me but maybe now ill be surfing by summer.
there are many better yoga dvds to choose from as a surfer there is no special surf yoga as opposed to regular yoga any surfer who takes the time to practice yoga will benefit peggys videos lack the vital instruction that beginners need to do poses properly without injury it is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community a better option is shiva rheas shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction and a yoga matrix which allows you to create your own unique routines most dvds become stale after awhile but the yoga matrix on shiva rheas dvd in addition to the  readymade routines prevent this dvd from ever getting old.
this is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type if you have a basic knowledge of yoga you dont need this at all  you can create and tailor your own workout if you dont know yoga its useless the instruction is poor peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga no wonder the surf mags think its great with little very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga in some scenes you cant even see their feet a crucial failure  even if the instructor says what to do save your money take yoga long enough to learn it properly then apply it to your own surfing yoga is great for surfing but this is a poor video.
if you know anything about yoga do not buy this cd the only positive parts is the location and view of the waves this is more a novelty than useful honestly who does yoga in a wetsuit at pipelinetry ali mcgraws video for a great intermediate yoga tape.
i purchased this book under the impression it had a book key for quia required by my profesorait didnt have any book key so now i have to return it and just buy the one from the bookstore like i should have done from the beginningalso ups was a day late and didnt leave the book as i requested by signing the leave package form left by the delivery man i had to go pick it up myself because im never at home.
this thing is ok but realize you must hold it onto your blow out port to make it work therefore you need  people to blow out your pipes when you are blowing out an rv constant air pressure is the key so saying that i ripped off the needle and attached an air chuck fitting to it now i just screw this on attach my air hose and pop on the compressor and i no longer need to hold it in place.
when i selected this book i was looking for a book i could share with young children ages  years and up to give them a glimpse of nigeria its people and culture i liked the photographs which accurately depicted various professionslifestyles in nigeria and some of them provide wonderful ideas for story book extensions for example the photograph of the grandmother making a traditional outfit could be complemented by presenting to the children a few yards of woven fabric that is typically used in nigeria for such outfits other professional roles we see nigerians in are baker doctor wood carvercarpenter lawyer potter blacksmith and finally the traditional native doctor or herbalist who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties all in all it paints nigerians as an industrious people which is what we are.
my son was very excited as we put the cd in the player but when the music started he was very unhappy the songs dont sound anything like the ones on the show the melody and pace are different and the performers arent interesting dont buy if you are familiar with the real songs.
this is my first lou reed video i can honestly say that i enjoyed it i have gained some new perspective on lous music he is a true professional before i turned it on i knew i would like my favorites sweet jane and walk on the wild side but i found myself enveloped in the other songs which i had never heard before i was a casual lou reed fani think if i liked it then a real hardcore fan will love itthe video is high quality and the sound is great its like having a front row seat im glad i purchased this one.
 to jazzie of hampstead london dont know what you were looking at your last graf where you make up some quote from lou at the end of the show is totally bogus in fact lou says just the opposite pay no attention to that innacurate review lou has his good nights and his bad nights this was one of the best performances of his career.
so far i really like it its very informative and useful i would have given  stars but i have it on kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper its difficult to flip through the book and find what you need but i am fairly new to kindle so maybe its just me or old fashion enough to prefer a book in hand but i do recommend it in whichever form you prefer.
i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man i urge you to avoid it at all costs you will not notice the insipidly simple tune working its way into the core of your being and thus transform you into a similar state of insipid simplicity for kylie minogue i can find many uses  for her music i find none.
this movie is about two twins who look alike and they are on there own soccer teamthey switch teams without their mom nowing.
i think this movie was great i just couldnt stand the bad acting of the guy marykates character liked he seemed to be angry at her even when they were just talking yuck.
this movie had bad acting the dad is dramactic and corney the mom is just corney and all of the soccer coaches are acting like it was big pro sports championship the olson twins were corny but entertaining to watch this movie is unrealistic that emma ashley and sam mary kate were on  different teams its a rule that siblings be on same sports team this movie has bad quality actors and a unrealistic plot.
switching goals was very good the plot was better than the average mary kate and ashley movie but it wasnt as funny or had as good of acting as the others this movie is good to watch a couple of times but only a couple times if you have extra cash though i say get it you wont regret it.
my son wanted this video so we got it there is a danger in making things that children think are real maybe a few more warnings in the video saying this is not real would be good.
langston hughes is definitely a better poet than he is a novelist i found this book to be lack luster and boring although you may like a character or twoin general the characters were not developed nor were they intriguing his wording lacked the rapture that we are accustomed to him delivering.
i really liked this book the characters were intersting and the relationship sandy had with his grandmother made me think of my grandmother the book would be good for young people to give them a idea of what black life was like back in the s and s.
i contact the company by e mail to return the product as directed the company e mails back to ask for a reason and if the product was opened i replied and the company did not what is the next step to return the product .
it is a great suit great buy great service all around i would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a frosty suit to buy one of these.
as other reviewers have suggested this book is full of errors i used this book along with the official guide and the rea book which is much better for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless there are so many errors that i found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that i didnt already know to be accurate which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide many of the mistakes are obvious but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in errorthis book is not worth the time.
i just began using this book to review for the gre in april i havent gotten very far into the book but in the first  pages i have already found four seriously misleading errors and thats just the ones ive caught some of the equations even the hendersonhasselbalch they provide are wrong there is even a convenient example worked out with an erroneous equation you can use this book to learn about what topics you should study for the gre but do the actual studying from real chemistry textbooks.
this is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this cd are all of them if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do.
this is too small for the age of child its designed for i swear there used to be a larger version plus it didnt survive more than a few sessions of our play group before the spring broke.
my  year old son received this as a christmas gift once it was initally setup he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger very gentle however after  rounds of play we were unable to get the teeth to pop back up or to get the rest of the teeth to push down needless to say he was very disappointed as was i does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one.
i specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose it was to be taken on a trip to visit with my  year old grandson what fun we laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns well after less than a day the only tooth that would cause the jaws to snap was the center tooth not too much fun there i feel i wasted my money.
yes this video is bad quality but it is great to see bowie and the spiders in their final concert bad quality or not im only  and obviously never had the privilidge of seeing them live so this is a great opportunity i believe the ziggy era was the most fascinating and exciting adrogyny is the only way to go.
imagine action films were  minutes long there would be no time for subplots or romantic involvements or no you go on without me  all there would be is car chases and explosions godwills book is rather like thati liked itforget the measured blend of theory fact and example which is the style of oreillys authors this book cuts to the chase and it worksyou see tomcat is a servlet runner it isnt that interesting or even the best of breed jetty is way better tomcat is as interesting as what you do with it and goodwill drags you along through a flash tour of all the goodiesits a bit like a night tour of naples on the back of an italian cigarette smugglers vespa somehow at the end despite not having understood much you find you know your way around and feel comfortable exloring further on your owntake it or leave it thats just the kind of book it is.
a waste of timeglory for old time movies that try to claim a life in a new world and they dontdont bother a nice tape to record overand the last time i buy a film because brandon frazier is in it naked or not.
one of the best films ever made gods and monsters works on many levels it presents the many roles men play  gaystraight husbandbachelor parentchild lovermonster youthelderly whitecollarbluecollar  wrapped in a captivating story listen for the musi.
gods and monsters is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director james whale  who directed frankenstein and bride of frankenstein the acting is superb especially ian mckellan in the lead i thought it dragged in a few areas but on the whole it was a great movie.
one of the few recent films that i anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectationssir ian mckellen once again performs well the real surprise here is brendan fraser thanks to bill condons amazing screenplay fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to mckellens anguished and selfdefeated character make a point to get this one best screenplays consist of strong dialogue pacing and narrative the oscars are usually accurrate about that.
the manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed and the pole in the center of the tree was bent beyond redemption i have no idea how this tree looked all put together since i had to repack it and send it back thankfully amazoncoms return policy is generous and swift  they get five stars for service in the meantime it was a real tree for me again this year    i may try to go with an artificial one next year but will not order one online again.
of the  baseball books ive read babe the legend comes to life is my favorite creamer wrote the book while some of the oldtimers were still alive and this makes his story come to life if you want to learn about babe ruth this is the definitive book to read.
this book was excellent the author gives us an intimate portrait of one of the greatest and most colorful athletes of the th century babe ruth overall we learn a lot about him and baseball during the roarong s into the smy only issue was that i didnt like the way the book abruptly ended with his death i would have liked to have read more about his funeral and the aftermath of his death plus i would have liked to learn more about how his legacy was treated the years after his deathnevertheless this book is a great read and i highly recommend it to any baseball or sports fan.
my car is a  honda civic ex save yourself a headache and get this if you have to replace your stereo plug and play.
this is the first book ive read by meg wolitzer and overall i enjoyed it the plot brings three justturnedthirty friends into close and prolonged contact with the something mother of their recently deceased friend wolitzer is able to pull this off because she obviously likes all of her characters their various flaws notwithstanding she also has the type of sense of humor that allows her to ligthen things up when emotions and events threaten to drag things down too much the strongest character is the mother natalie who is one of the more appealing baby boomers in recent fiction and by no means a mere caricature my only objection is that several secondary characters are not as clearly drawn as the main ones but in fairness to wolitzer in most novels the reader would not even care about knowing more about such relatively minor characters and its only her gift for making you care that makes this an issue at all.
the novel is a wrenching pageturner about a womans loss of an adult daughter and her subsequent attempts to cope and live the author artfully describes experiences of the mother and the dead womans friends as they provide each other with memories and support needed to adapt to the sudden death of a young woman whom they loved it is the best book i have read all year.
i looked forward to reading yet another meg wolitzer novel and i was very disappointedin fact i lost interest early on and never finished it some of the authors earlier works such as sleepwalking and hidden pictures were excellentwhat happened.
good book to start wit.
i got this book because it had such awesome reviews im going to be taking a test in the near future and youre allowed to use a medical dictionary and i picked this oneive been taking practice tests on the first practice test i took the first  out of  medical terms i tried to look up werent in the book i was stunned and several of them were pretty basic words that i just wanted to get a very clear definition ofim not sure its even going to be worth lugging this book to the test or even keeping the book i may just sell it and try another bookjane.
i bought this bed recently for my  year old lab mix he doesnt dig chew or abuse things in any way so i wasnt concerned with getting a super abuseproof bed but after a couple of weeks of limited use i found a hole in the soft side of the bed the fact that this side attracts hair is unfortunate but a hole being made almost immediately makes this bed not worth buying it may have been a decent design if it was made with sturdy materials very disappointing.
i love this video unfortunately it doesnt show on a blue rays dvd player which means i cant enjoy it  i was a bit frustrated however other purchases in the past have been great through amazon.
my copy even has an arrow pointer on the front cover picture talk about lousy merchandising no dolby much less dts only a pcm stereo recording video is average like proper packaging and presentation were no more than an afterthoughtall in all this looks like a bootleg edition and no its an official release amazing messy what were they thinking.
while even some members of the bonzos give this album low marks i personally think keynsham holds up very well without it we wouldnt have you done my brain in mr slaters parrot the definitive look at me im wonderful quiet talks and summer walks or sport the odd boy which would be a damn shame no matter how you slice it while this did prove to be the end of the line lets make up and be friendly notwithstanding there still seemed to be a lot of gas left in the tank.
i love this my kids have so much fun with these they are strong and hold up to ruff play they shoot water clear accross the pool.
i found it interesting it will be used in an adult ed class i will have a better idea of its uses after the class meets and discusses the poems how it reflects the times and how comfortable gabirol was in medieval spain.
if you follow my reviews you know that i am anglo catholic and that the  versions i use most are the good news and the original revised standard i have respect for the king james the new king james the jerusalem the english standard version and the holman christian standard i do not like the niv or the nrsv onto the subject at hand the nasb is widely praised as the most literally accurate version it does not contain the apocrypha but being that this is a protestant bible we cant really hold that against it the nasb is widely accepted in protestant churches for the most part it is carefully literal i consider it an interesting cross between the revised standard and the new king james my one slight complaint is that it is not quite as beautifully written as the revised standard but that said the new american standard is excellent.
i love all of clifton webb films this one really extracts his serious side of acting great film of the era he is truly the one of the best actors of his time.
so cheap and poorly made that when you use the item it cuts your finger every single time.
the examples which were given in the textbook were way too simple when you compare to the homework problems never explain how to do bode plot at all i am glad i know how to do differential equations before taking the class otherwise to use the method that taught by this book i would be dead they never explain well on those differential equations and the concept behind.
a book with a heavily religious slant anyone expecting a scientific discussion of sexual addiction should be prepared to read that god has responded to the arrogance of the human heart by turning people over to the control of their evil desires.
as a psychologist specializing in the field of sexual health i am utterly shocked and dismayed at this book for those suffering from sexual addiction or for their partners who are looking for some peace please do not invest in this propaganda this book is not based on the science of either psychology or sexual health and is nothing more than the worst aspect of religious dogma and will ultimately result in further suffering this type of hate mongering intolerant uneducated mindset is what has led to many of historys most devastating atrocities done in the name of god a basic ethic of psychology and counseling is that that counselor or professional does not impose his or her own values upon their patients shame on you for writing such a book and calling yourself a counselor you are an embarrassment to those of us who have dedicated our lives to trying to relieve human suffering.
this book was suggested to me by a counselor i was seeing to help me deal with the fallout of my husbands confession of sexual addiction we both read the book and it truly helped both of us to understand some of the underlying issues associated with this addiction there is so much information in this book and i would highly reccomend it to anyone facing this kind of situation.
i have had this concert on vhs for almost  years and have been waiting for the dvd i just purchased this today and to my surprise it seems like the picture and audio are not in sync the sound and picture are about a second off from each other did anyone else encounter this problem or did i just get a bad dvd.
i recently replaced my  year old velodyne fsr with the dd i did so because the fsr was struggling in our new house with larger great room and because the dd was on sale due to its being replaced soon by the dd plus at considerably higher pricethe dd is cruising in our new house it really provides the bottom end that my klipsch heresies cannot and it does not run out of steam at high volume like the fsr didi am mainly a music guy not so much into home theatre the dd brings music to life and makes the singers and instruments seem to be in the room with you everything you need is included and the calibration software is a snap to use the cabinetry is first rate i got the cherry finish and although i cant tell if it is really cherr.
its a great book but the mindstorms microproessor is now nxt  it has been updated until this book is updated youd be better off to find a good book which is based on the nxt system.
no one can tell you what the experience of changing churches is like unless they have been there this book is presented with wise counsel from ministers who have been there much of the advice you receive first hand on this subject is less than adequate because it is not thorough when you study all of these essays together they are sincere simple and complete this is a must read for those who are stuggling with the choice to move the one knock i would make on the book is that sometimes it is not time to move and the book says very little about when to stay where you are more detail should be given to the decision making process.
tego es la fuerza en la musica latina es una tremenda mezcla de son salsa reggaeton y hiphop que estupendo.

this is a terrific recording rob brown is simply one of the most interesting alto saxophonists playing today a keening strident tone with an attack that is relentles.
this a good movie in the same vain as most of chuck norriss films plenty of action a must have for your collection.
i saw the movie based on this book when it came out in the s and i recommended it to my daughter when we found that it is virtually impossible to get a copy of the movie it never came out on dvd and i no longer own a vhs player i explored the option of reading the book i was intrigued when i realized that the book was written in the s  a bit of a cultural leap from the s when the movie was produced  so i decided to give it a read although i didnt grow up in the priveleged classes of manhattan i was a teenager throughout the s and i could relate to the times it seemed a little milder in some respects from what i remember of the movie and my memory is not the greatest but it was a thoroughly enjoyable read.
i love the bradley smoker and these little bisquettes it uses it is so easy to use weve used the mesquite and pork and chicken its all turned out great.
have been using exuviance products for many years they are the best its too bad they are not widely known everyone would look a lot younger exuviance should be advertising their products.
my fault i received it ok but it just doesnt work on my water heater i must not have checked it enough it was a bad impulse buy for me.
this is the first book from candice porter i have read and i cannot wait to begin reading her other novels from the minute i read the first page i knew that this book would be original and hard to put down the characters are believable and ms proctors writing is so detailed that you feel you are there with them throughout the book i would definitely recommend this book  you will not be sorry that you bought it.
i almost didnt buy this album after hearing some of the two star reviews from the others but i took a chance on it and i give it  stars put it where you want it is excellent both in track one and the jamming version on track  and roll with it is also excellent theres no question that its hard to beat some of larrys finest songs my personal favorite is smiles and smiles to go and its hard to beat his old album discovery but if youre a larry carlton fan i think  stars is about right for this one.
esta pelicula es una de las mejores que e visto alex se luce dando una clase de road movie con gore al por mayor esta pelicula no es apta para personas sensibles esta al nivel de asesinos por naturaleza de oliver stone.
this bbc produced docudrama displays its roots  the british apparently cannot get beyond the fact that wernher von braun was the mastermind behind the v program i cant say i blame them thats human nature but it must be factored in by viewers who are not fully aware of the facts after watching this program an uninformed viewer would be left with the impression that virtually everyone working on the american program was morally intellectually and patriotically inferior to their russian counterpartsviewers will probably enjoy the drama but should take it cum grano salis.
the space race wasnt quite as one sided as one might believe this series outlines the benefits of capitalism over communism but also shows serious flaws in nasa work to get man to the moon before this decade is out.
yet not so badwell to be really honest with you i didnt like this book personally i though ann rinaldi couldve done a little better some parts are interesting and maybe even suspensful but the rest is kind of dull at some points in the book emily the main character is lying so much to her uncle valentine and is being so selfish its like okay so whens she going to tell the truth or at least realize what she has done.
this book is really excitin.
this book was an absolute joy to read it immersed you into the characters you felt totally attached to them it let me in to a new aspect of the civil war that i had never seen beforeit was interesting and definitely not boring this book is what i call a peopley book she forms the characters so that they seem like real people with real problems.
this was the first book i had read by ann rinaldi and i loved it i have read many other books by her since then at first i thought i would not like this book because it takes place over  years ago but i was wrong rinaldi draws you into the book the main character emily is very likable shes not perfect she has some flaws like when she thinks her problem with her uncle is worse then when her friends mother is arrested and may be put to death the novel is also very historically accurate before i never knew grave robbing had been a problem in the s i highly reccomend this book.
as soon as i had read the first few sentences of the review i immediately knew that the author had based this story on a song by loreena mckennitt called the highway man from her  cd book of secrets since ms mckennitt is on of my favorite composers i had to read the bookunfortunately the book did not do justice to the song or the woman who wrote the song did the author have permission to write this im sorry but listening to the song is preferable.
what can i say this cd is pretty much everything the other cowboy bebop cds arent its pretty much either  take a perfectly good track and ruin it by throwing a lot of drums on top vibert or  as far as i can tell calling a mediocre lifeless piece of electronic pap by the same name as a totally dissimilar but good track off another cd  hero either way the originals far outshine any of the pointless meddling done on this cdon the doesdoesnt include vitaminless topic i got this album by mistake i ordered vitaminless but what i got was a double cd of this and vitaminless i cant imagine a more mistaken pairing.
i love this stuff i first bought in hawaii and it made my skin feel and smell so wonderful so i bought it online to bring me back to those great hawaii memories when i cant be there in person.
i have not heard this album but for those of you who remember the original priss from the bubblegum crisis hurricane should be on here if not than it is not her best.
my copy of this book is nearly destroyed from all the use it receives this book is not just for winter many of the tours described have also turned out to be excellent mountain bike routes and hiking trips the descriptions of the areas the routes traverse could be expanded but the route information itself is first class.
this product works great but you will need a different driver see ralink website for it i run both xp pro and xp  bit and i had some problems this product did not work the same with both versions of xp without the driver from ralink included software had problems with my netgear router speed was not fast or consistent.
this product was just how i remembered it when i used it  years ago yes the answers are hard to see until you press down real hard but that is how it was  years ago and i did not expect anything different i would recommend this product to anyone trying to teach their kids addition and subtractionmy children look at it like a computer and love playing with it it gives them instant answers when they press down and they like that satisfaction.
the book wasnt as great as the reviews said it was the explanation on many of the topics was sketchy and didnt have the detail i expected eg awt its probably a better book if you already know java and are looking to catch some of the finer points i dont recommend it for absolute beginners.
i previously wrote a scathing review of this bad book and i was quite annoyed to find that some one posing to be me michael g from passaic nj said that i was mistaken for my previous diatribe of the book im not sure who it was obviously someone figured that i was not going to read the reviews again im not sure who it wasi still maintain that the beek is bad it seems that some one is trying to sell this at all costs this makes me very suspicious of all amazon reviews sorry mg.
the hound of the baskervilles is a true mystery classic by sir arthur conan doyle it tells of sherlock holmes and his trusty comrade dr john watson this extraordinary pair has solved dozens of mysteries times before but now come to their most difficult case years ago hugo baskerville was killed by a monstrous hound this curse of the hound has haunted all the baskervilles who come to live at the baskerville hall sir charles goes to live there but soon is found dead scared to death his only relative sir henry baskerville goes to live at baskerville hall accompanied by holmes and watson all along the way they are left mysterious clues that eventually help them unlock the killer i really liked this classic whodunit because around every corner was a twist it kept you guessing until the end and was really upbeat.
seeing as how series  of sherlock has yet to make it to the united states i was hoping that this would be the script or at least an adaptation of the script to a novel format sadly this was not the casei confess that i fail to see how this series of bbc books distinguishes itself from the other often free editions much less the compilations available in the kindle store there is a new introduction by a member of the bbcs sherlock staff and company but that scarcely justifies the costthe text itself is the standard text by sir arthur conan doyle which speaks for itself.
well you dont get much of holmes in this story and many folks either neglect to mention that or just dont notice i figure they dont notice because its such a darn good read at first its talk talk talk but the restlessness left me with oncoming chapters and i became engrossed read it.
as other reviewers have pointed out this particular kindle version is broken any passages in the original which appeared in italic type have failed to be transcribed leaving large gaps in the narrative especially at the beginningtherefore i rate this edition one star.
this review is not on the quality of the story i love this book however this edition is missing text whenever character reads out of a newspaper or other document the entire txt of that newspaper or document is missing from this kindle edition ive no idea which version to spend the dollar on to get the complete text but its frustating as this was my first download.
when i got the product and opened the box the literature said that you cannot use the kind of shower head that has a valve that turns off the flow this is because the filter housing is plastic and is subject to cracking or bursting if you turn off the flow downstream from the filterthats the kind of shower head i have and i like to use the valve feature i really really wish that egeneralmedical had said this in their limited online literature and they expect me to pay the return shipping and a  restocking fee.
its a strange size for my tv but its a  movie so its exceptional i have wanted this movie for years so i bought it.
i got this video on loan from netflix as a railfan i was extremely disappointed in this the show was nothing like i had anticipated it being like and the host is just plain annoying trying to emulate emeril lagasse.
great video my son cant get enough of this any child or adult who loves trains will enjoy this dvd.
i love holland and the dutch language and my dutch penpal sent me a tape with various dutch artists i love dromen zijn bedrog which is a mix of sort of moderns music techno and a chorus in the background fast and energetic i dont recall the other songs too well but this album is awesome go dutch.
john bunyans pilgrims progresshas to be one of the most captivating books ever written this book should be required reading in todays school system from the verybeginning mrbunyan spins the tale of a journey that is most fantastic thur perils unbeliveable he somehow overcomes tremendous odds ofcompleting it but yet he does andthe rewards are magnificent a mustfor anyone born again.
in this book buyan writes about average everyday things of the s and about the christian plight of that time i found it remarkable how truth does not change .
what a great voice and masterful delivery of material someone else wrote sexy with a capitol s but that is insufficient im not a big jazz fan and i guess this is not classic jazz but some subgenre that really turns me on somehow the instrumentation which is good fades into the backround because christys voice is so present and distinctive i cant tell you how many times ive played this cd and chosen it over my favorite classic rock its a great album to enjoy when youre happy just being by yourself and also a very nice listen when youre with someone special im so glad i found some other music by her and i surely hope there is more comming by the way it has a couple of cuts that dont feature her and they are interesting and dont detract from the album also i read in one of her bios that she starred in an indie movie called pants on fire you can bet ill be watching that if i can locate it.
i was excited to get my steppin album because i loved the other album of christy baron i thought about you however i was a bit disapointed beacause it was so inferior compared to i thought about you i was expecting more of christy barons sultry renditions of real accoustic jazz but what i got was some sort of a synthesized versions its still a good album but its nothing like the other one if you can only buy one album of christy baron dont get this one.
painful neither paltrow nor beckinsale were perfect either but this one was appallingthis movie is packaged in  cassettes and i couldnt even make it through the first one where do i begin the hair was awful especially mr eltons the casting was awful jeremy northam will always be mr knightley to me the costumes were awful zippers anyone i hung in as long as i could to see what they did with frank churchill but i just couldnt go on so sadmy feeling about a good adaptation is that it should make you want to run out and buy the book im glad id already read emma  or  times because this movie certainly would not have made me desperate to read the book i probably would have run screaming in the other directioni did like their take on mr woodhouse though thank goodness for small favors.
i have this toothpaste and the ada seal of approval is nowhere to be found on the tube it doesnt whiten either.
i found this exact same product for  today at walgreens this is a sale price however even regular price is less than this i feel somemany of the mega diaper packs on amazon are a good deal but not this one.
the title says it all i never had a trouble with  leaking but almost everytime my breastfed son has a bm which are usually somewhat loose it leaks out the back or leg area perhaps it happens because the waistband isnt stretchy im not going to buy these diapers again.
claudia and shea are both in trouble at school if they fail one more language test she may not past the sunject so what they do is to help each other and thats where they become friends.
a good but slow performance by brando the girl should be in future films mature only.
brando is my favorite actor and hes known for taking on anyrole and doing a great job he did a great job on this film too but he should have walked away from this one i am an admirer of off the edge movies and themes that are hard to takehowever this film leaves the viewerwith only one thought bertolucci is a filthy lecherous old man i rarely hate a movie but this bankrupt purely perverted film is just awful hope brando made a lot of money at least.
this is another artistic movie the acting was very convincing and all the stuff they say about the powerful acting of marlon brando and the convincing youth and innocence of the onehitwonder girl that starred with him is valid it was worth watching but probably not worth owning its ultimately very depressing and doesnt really leave you holding on to anything the sex scenes were pretty explicit but not really anything you couldnt see in a hardr movie today buy it for the acting not the story.
the dvd will not play it goes thru the process of downloading until the last point  then says that it is not programed for downloading i would like to send it back for a dvd that will play.
i really love this book just as much as the two before it i just dont want the series to end because im enjoying it so much.
at the risk of repeating what all the other reviewers have stated let me just say that this was as finely crafted a scarfest since the first alien film writerdirector neil marshall is to be commended for creating a first rate horror film that for once doesnt rely on all the hacneyed tricks and cgi effects that have come down the pike in the last several years as well as utilizing cast of unknowns who also cant act to save their lives this cast of unknowns are all good actors and handle their roles admirably the score by david julyan is the perfect accompaniment to marshalls film and the cinematography and editing by sam mccurdy and jon harris respectively combine to make this the true jewel of horror filmsi normally dont purchase films of this ilk but after renting the film and getting the bejesus scared out of me i just had to own a copy i would therefore recommend this film to anyone who enjoy their shocks and frights at high octane levels.
this is a lame and completely unbelievable movie straight from the stype phony monsters a group of women decide to spelunk with no flight plan filed with anyone then of course one of them chooses to take the rest into an unexplored cave without mentioning to the others that it could be is dangerous with friends like thatthen of course in the cave blind monsters people in rubber suits show up to murder all the womenfirst of all why would such strong fearless women in the beginning of the movie suddenly turn into cringing screaming and hysterical stereotypessecondly the monsters are so badly done that one expects to see zippers on the back of their rubber suitssteer clear of this movie it is horrible i was embarrassed for the filmmakers.
this tape should be sold as an audio only the cave scenes are so dark it is pointless to watc.
this movie totally sucks i only spent  dollars on it and i still think i wasted my money the monsters were so fake and it took like an hour before anything happened the only cool part was at the begining when that guy died from that pole thats it the movie sucked dont buy it.
i love horror movies but this is really a horrible movie the gore looks fake and a lot of it appears to be cg although some real props were used the actresses were very bad at acting and not in that cool bhorror movie way either they suck i know tons of gore fans like myself may like this movie but its trashthe only good thing about this movie is that it is only  minutes longguess i will start having to go back to the asian import shop for good horror.
had been given such a write up on this  disappointing to say the least no shocks  highly predictable  and with a theme that has been done to death.
i used this book for an entomology class at my college and i think it is great wanting to be an entomologist and knowing a lot of information about the subject already i still didnt find it boring or tedious and people who know nothing about insects can understand it pretty easily too i highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in entomology and what the subject entails.
i saw this when i was  years old and it freaked the shiznit out of me  low on gore high on psychological thrils magic is an oldschool horror flick of the classic kind  anchored by anthony hopkins early bravura dual performance as corkyfats  but what i remember most about magic isnt the movie but the scary as hell tv spots that used to run back in the s on latenight tv  the bonus materials explain that after the simple yet very creepy tv ads ran once on tv in new york they were pulled due to parental complaints about frightening their little tots  theyre werent far of the mark  as the camera pulls in and fats intones his evil poem  magic is funweredead  youll feel your blood turn to ice a nice dvd to complete your horror collection  .
magic stars anthony hopkins long before silence of the lambs his character corky is a magician who cant seem to catch a break he decides to try his luck at using a ventriloquist doll during his act and he becomes a success his ventriloquist partner fats starts to take over corkys thoughts and motives the success that his act has brought him starts to push him further into insanity and he runs off to escape with fats it is at this point that corkys weird life begins to fall apart he finds his long lost love and her violent drunk husband when fats decides to take over i remember seeing this movie as a kid and it really scared me just the thought of a doll coming to life is a bit disturbing great movie.
cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons photographer bear advocate cited for getting too close to bruins by scott mcmillion bozeman daily chronicle  cole has been cited for harassing bear in yellowstone national park he hasnt had his day in court yet but youve got to wonder its easy to get closeup photos of grizzlybrown bears at designated and wellmanaged bear viewing areas in alaska and canada to get publishable photos of grizzly bears in yellowstone or glacier youve got to get so close you put yourself in danger and run the risk of driving the bears away from food they need or a place they want to be grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower  states why bother them when you can get photographs of grizzlies in alaska without stressing the bears what kind of bear advocate would do that.
this book is the absolute best buy for ap spanish language preparation it goes through every aspect of the test and has a very thorough review of all grammar tested in the exam although i thought that they had a little more then what was needed the practice tests accurately measure with the difficulty and format of the real test having a bad situation with an inexperienced teacher i picked up this book and used it for selfstudy it helped me greatly and in the end i received a  just by going through it myself and practicing.
i bought this to replace my original hp l laser jet after  years this seems to do a great job so far much faster downloads and clean printbut beware it does not come with a usb cord to connect so if the printer your replacing has the old stle connecter as mine did be ready to spend another  for a usb cord that is why i gave it  instead of  stars.
i have bought this printer for my personal use at homeit is good and reliable printer for the pricesomehow it arrived with software instalation cd in a forein language which was a big inconveniencethe white color chose by manufacturer is a questionable it is a white spot in a room and i bet for many households it can be a problemalso lack of any controls buttons is inconvenient to restart a job even after paper reload.
bought this and just to test if i would keep it i printed a huge database file of  pages which took me almost  hours between personal breaks and only five cartridges the guide says dont do that but i did it and this  printer did not fail once wow needless to say i kept it.
i like this printer a lot and would probably have given it  stars but it gets a major demerit thanks to the fact that it does not work with computers running vista hp will not be releasing the drivers until july of this year so if you want to print now and not wait six months and youve already upgraded to vista i recommend getting a different printer hopefully hp will get the message and release some drivers vista has been in beta for a long time so i find this delay to be inexcusable.
i cant beleive this printer only worked for  months i bought it last dec but only start to use it  months ago now it stopped working does anybody know this printer has any warranty thanks.
if you need a home light duty printer that provides professional laser printed documents perhaps say for a small home business or a private laser printer for an executives office this is perfect it is not for huge jobs or big projects but for the little jobs that need professional flair.
when i first started reading the book i kept putting it down it just wasnt grabbing my attention but once i got further into the book my curiosity got the best of me i couldnt put the book down i could not believe that a woman would do the things that she did adrian jenkins was confused and deceitful all hell does break loose gregorys relationship with his mother was sad i understand her point for leaving but at the same time it was selfish it not only destroyed gregory but it also destroyed his little sister i am definately looking forward to her next book.
hardly ever see this movie on tvso i had to orderlove it a must see went see it at the old movie house with my school when i was a kidnever forgotten it.
dont buy it if meths new album isnt at least ten times better than this then rap is officially dead and the only thing that can resurrect it is a bone thugs reunion.
of all the albums we bought in the s this is one of my favorites when i get in the mood for reggae i usually start here with let my days be long or revolution on marleys natty dread it is religious as others have mentioned but that shouldnt be a problem if you appreciate different styles of reggae did i forget to mention super ape or augustus pablo man.
for a  slipmount installation this diverter spout is not worth the troubleyou must unscrew the diverters plastic nipple remove a plastic adapter slide it on the copper pipe screw the plastic nipple back on tighten the screw so as to punch a hole in the plastic slide the plastic nipple back toward the wall tighten the screw and then screw the spout on after applying thread tape that seems straightforward but in practice its very difficultthe problem is that the plastic nipple is too small to fit  copper pipes longer than about  from the wall the instructions say that the pipe can be up to  long but actually this is wrong at first i struggled with trying to install it then broke the plastic when i could not force it to go all the way ini elected instead to go withmoen bn kingsley slip fit tub diverter spout brushed nickel which simply slips in and then tightens with a screw with almost no effort.
thanks for compiling these recipes they were fun to read and although i am certain that i am not going to make any of them it was fun reading them.
the tracks are greatthe playing might be greatthe recording quality is wretchedi hate to say that but it is that bad.
jeez i figured you guys knew about coffee this is a terrible excuse for a warmer it keeps your coffee slightly above body temperature not nearly warm enough to be pleasant i bought two of them and am tossing them out anyone considering this item dont buy one.
i was given this as a christmas gift and its more than lived up to my expectationsit wont heat a cold cup of coffee but it will keep a cup at a very nice temperature for a very long timeworks best if you actually drink the coffee the less coffee in the cup the more effective it is a full cup of coffee left for a couple hours will moderately warm but if you actually drink the coffee slowly over time the end will still be a good temp.
the warmer keeps the cup at an acceptable temperature and looks great on the desk the warming light is very useful in reminding me if the unit is on or off i could not be more pleased with this product and the cost was perfect.
i have used a dazey and it worked great the mr coffee keeps it a little warm but i like my coffee hot.
this is my second coffee warmer i lost my first one a noname cheap model that worked beautifully so i bought two of the mr coffee version one for me and one for my spouse it really wont maintain the temperature of the coffee until your cup is down to about  ounce left i would not recommend this product we had the same experience with both mr coffee warmers so it wasnt a case of a defective item it just doesnt work.
i have been using this product for a few weeks i have a ceramic tea pot that i use to make a few cups of tea at a time and the tea was getting cold way too quickly this product keeps my whole pot of tea nice and warm for as long as it takes me to drink  which has been up to about six hours im getting ready to buy a second one for my tea cup so my tea stays warm once i pour it from the tea pot.
purchased this in  doesnt keep coffee warm well barely warm  but significantly cooler than id like my preference is a cup that is almost as warm as when it is first poured  not crazy hot but more than lukewarm this isnt even close and dont even think that it can warm up a cup that has started to cool because youve been carrying it around for a few minutes.
the mr coffee mug warmer truely is a mug warmer i use it daily my mug is warm but my beverage isnt.
the warmer works just fine at keeping coffee warm the switch on the body of the unit is easy to locate as opposed to one on the cord the one downside is that it is too small to hold a very large mug i guess it just holds the standard size.
the hot plate part is not big enough to fit the starbucks city mugs so note that but a smaller mug aka regular sized or one that doesnt have a wide base will fit fine i agree with other reviewers who said that it keeps drinks warm when full and hotter when less full i think the product description should specify the size mug that fits i will keep it because it works well.
this works well to keep your coffee warm longer it doesnot keep hot like when it comes out of the coffee makebut it does keep it warm long enough for you to finish yourcoffee.
im a huge tea drinker  i enjoy drinking coffee but with my work im constantly running around the office so if it wasnt for this warmer my coffee  tea would be ice cold but this warmer really keeps it luke warm but of course the first few times there was a smell when my metallic mug is placed on the warmer but now the smell is gone.
it does not keep coffee very warmi can lay my hand on the warming plate with no discomforthope that paints the picture you need.
this thing needs a high med low setting cause the only setting it has is low i made a cup of really nice organic japanese shade grown tea  an ounce and asked my wife to bring me an ice cube to warm it up after it had been on the heater for  minutes the pad gets pretty hot but not near hot enough to keep a cup of coffee hot after something has been sitting on it for about    minutes you can gulp it with no fear of getting burnt a worthless piece of crap i will see if it works as a candle warmer.
i have not experienced an even warm cup of tea let alone hot since using this product i tried preheating it and still no results very disappointed i positively dont recommend this product.
only keeps coffee tepid at best actual element gets very ho.
i am very disappointed in the mr coffee cup warmer my coffee is really hot when i first put it on however on themr coffee mwblk mug warmerin less than an hour the coffee is luke warm i cant stand luke warm coffee so it is useless in my opinion dont waste your money why cant they make a good coffee cup warmer i am still looking.
i was a great fan of the mr coffee mugactivated warmer the ones i had finally gave out so i looked to buying more and some for friends i could find only the onoff switch warmer although it was initially called mugactivated on the screen so ordered  as already stated the coffee is kept only warm and you definitely have to remember to turn off the warmer or you could return hours later and find it still on which could be a danger i have been unable to find a mugactivated warmer but continue the search because i do not believe this onoff switch is any good.
three criticisms the narrator didnt explain the phenomenon of waterpocket fold  for ten minutes cheesy coloration.
great history of the company but i was disappointed in the little milk glass content the author talks about how important the opal milk glass line was for business but does not offer much samples of it in the book.
this is a difficult book to rate because it is strong on a few points but extremely weak on others it provides the most detailed history of westmoreland glass that i have ever seen and some of the facts are fascinating however it is very very very poorly organized photos are not always identified many items are discussed but not depicted in photo or sketch the price guide in the back uses different namesdescriptions than what is used in the text of the book so you can never be sure if you are checking value on the correct item i enjoyed the book but if you want to learn more about various pieces of westmoreland glass you will need to buy other books unfortunately i cannot offer advice on what others because i have not found a good one yet lorainne kovars books are grossly overpriced and still do not do the job they should i would not recommend kovars books on any subject.
if you read above it says that there are  discs on this record then you look at the top and see only two discs i expected the entire  disc collection but got only two so if this being advertised above as two and it says  down below shouldnt this be corrected or is this a case of false advertising.
this book was a waste of my time  i bought the bundle and now im not going to bother reading any more of ms cruises ghastly stories the dialogue was atrocious and not at all amusing not once did i even crack a smile let alone laugh out loud and the plot was so neatly wrapped up that it underscored its decided lack of depthagree with another reviewer  if you want mystery and romance read janet evanovich.
this is an awesome cd done by derryl perry higly recommend it most of the song he wrote and some collaborated with other songwriters like him outstanding vocals and musician plus songwriter.
aside from missing a few bolts i also found that the holes in the seat are drilled incorrectly i will have to drill my own holes to remedy this problem this is as far as i have gotten in the assembly as i have ran out of daylight i am sure when it is finally together it will be a  bench as opposed to my current  rating the shipping went well as it got here on time.
the workbook was missing the key software that will be required in the course very unhappy i wrote customer services and was not offered the missing software but only to send it back i need the workbook for my class and the class is in its fourth week i have since ordered the software from the manufacturerjim mcshane.
galbraith is a very clear writer he rarely uses technical jargon or mathematics but unlike some other popular writers it isnt because he is able to explain complex phenomena without them he doesnt appear to understand them this book reads like a fairy tale or childs letter to santa claus mr galbraith doesnt seem to understand economics well enough to pass economics  but he does have an excellent command of the english language.
please beware that this dvd that i purchased for use in the uk is the wrong region number it was sold to me who live currently in the uk but it only works in region  dvd players which made me really unhappy to know that to watch it i need to change settings of my dvd player but it has to be watched at once because i wont be able to change settings again and again as the appliance can malfunction after that the return policy should cover this type of problem and refund  in those cases it was not advertised that it would be a problem to play it in the uk which was really not a good sign all customers have the right to know exactly what they are paying fori am disapointed with amazon and this company for letting that happen.
smallville is a very unique take on the legendary man of steel but it is pretty much the same when it comes to using the two most popular icons in dc comics use superman and batman to promote other dc comics charactors but in this show it works to a point all i would say is that these last seasons of smallville have gotten justice league right and justice league was done right in thses last seasons of smallville it is a shame that the animated series that calls itself justice league was not more like this this show gets it right the way justice league should have been.
there are some folks who dislike season  but that just because they still want to see clark as that farm boy from smallville yet they dont realized that clark is no longer the farm boy that we all love but a news reporter who is embracing his destiny as the future superman yes i still miss the kent farm the talon the torch and even smallville high school but we must move on in season  clark is one step closer in being superman but he must first deal with his own personal issues including his new love for lois i love seeing new heroes on the show including stargirl and hawkman wont spoil more but season  is far the best.
i am a big fan of this show a big super man fan even more and everything theyve done couldnt have seen it done any other way im not a big comic book person mom never let me collect them but what i do know is the original movies are good but the stories were nowhere compared to this show the new movie i didnt like at all but i hear that lana has her own comic so i think it was important to keep her on the show for as long as they did im anxious to get the louis and clarke mess rolling cause u know theres going to be lots of laughs and i hope they keep this show going for along time even if they have a bad season or two bc  many shows r getting cancelled for the reason that people who rate good shows bad bring them down so i hope it keeps going like its going so we can keep enjoying this great show bc it hs great story lines good characters and so far a good record knock on wood.
needs to be better packaged it came with the case broken and two discs will not play all the way through.
if anyone else but marlene dietrich had played the lead in this film the film would have been awful dietrich triumphs in a role noone would have predicted mysterious mesmerizing seductive funny and finally moving as the loyal gypsy lyddia dietrich makes you overlook the films flaws at times the film drags by some supporting players seem to have cotton in their mouths as they speak and some of the dialogue is inane through it all dietrich is the soul of this movie holding it all together in spite of the flaws to make the whole thing work worth watching as a romantic piece of hollywood escapism and for seeing dietrich as the fine actress she is.
this is one of my favorite movies i own the lasedisc on widescreen i could not wait for the dvd i cant understand their decision to release this gem of a movie in the full screen version only what a shame.
rats i was all ready to buy this movie but the ephemistic fullscreen format ie pan and scan stopped me cold the reason i bought a dvd player in the first place besides the great running commentaries included with many movies is so i could see the entire image the director intended not some cropped  edittedfortelevision versioncall me a purist but i just dont buy cropped dvds like this one.
i have a toshiba blu ray player thats a year old and this blu ray dvd would not play in my player because its so new and apparently a  year old blu ray player needs an upgrade that costs  so now im reluctant to buy blu rays i regret getting a blu ray player at all now i gave this dvd to a friend and im sure its fine so just dont get it unless you have a new blu ray player.
great movie lots of fun i rent it every year so i bought it its a light movie with a great cast it reminds me of home.
this dvd is a good show it is good to see dvds still widely availible dvd is able to have true stereo and or sourround sound.
i have rated the dvd the lowest possible rating although i would give the movie the highest rating who makes these decisions regarding full screen versus letterbox with the advent of dvds there is no excuse for us to miss the incredible cinematography in all its new york glory i absolutely refuse to buy my own copy of this movie until it is reissued remastered and includes some serious extras this is one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time.
as if attending a crusade event in person the reader will find the always compassionate passionate and caring billy graham pleading for unbelievers to believe believers to come to the fullness promised to them as children of god and for those needing clarity on this important subject to hit the book and discover through the holy spirit what they need as i read i kept thinking i miss dr graham then i turned on the tv and one of his classic crusade presentations was on a religious channel you sometimes forget what a great teacher preacher evangelist and pastor he wasgreat great book that will bless challenge and inspire you to reach higher in your walk with the lord.
the aap says not to make your own green beans spinach squash etc due to the higher levels of nitrates so i thought this product would be great to introduce green beans to my  month old the product contains fish oil so it is not a suitable candidate for a  month old or an introductory food for any age it is also not returnablewhile the amazon site lists the product ingredients as green beans and water only the picture of the product says with dha the dha comes from fish oil after contacting amazon to clear up the fact that this was not the product i thought i was ordering they refunded my money they offered to send out a new replacement item but i think i would get the same mislabeled product while i was not happy about the trouble this mislabeling caused i think amazons customer service did a great job.
i prefer swaddlers to baby dry during the day but theyre hard to find in bigger sizes these baby dry pampers will hold a lot my son sleeps  to  hours a night  months old and the diaper lasts all night without every leaking these big packs from amazon are fantastic too the price is less per diaper than from  and even sams club plus amazon does free twoday shipping on diapers right now i won a free year of amazon prime for one of my diaper orders too cant beat that.
i created an account to have diapers delivered to my daughters house having twins her life is busy enough free shipping cant beat it love this idea.
so i bought these diapers because i have used the swaddlers before with success my daughter is  weeks old  pounds and uses size  for anyone that has not used swaddlers the difference between the two is clearly the quality as the diaper is much thinner almost paper thin upon the first use of this diaper i noticed that after a  hour nap my daughters onesie was was wet i gave the diaper another chance and had exactly the same issue i would not recommend this diaper as i believe the whole purpose of a diaper is to keep the baby dry.
these are good diapers that dont leak even with overnight soakings they dont hold up to blowouts as well as huggies little movers however.
pampers and huggies are in our opinion the best diaper brands out there we have a slightly preference for pampers because they look less bulky on the baby compared to huggies or store brands and it is the best deal i have for diapers considering the  discount from amazon subscribe  save program however ive noticed that the diaper is no longer available as a subscribe  save item so i am not sure whether i would buy it for the full price  i would have to compared unit costs using my spreadsheet to see if it is worth it.
pampers baby dry is a huge misnomerthey are terrible for urine intake if your baby sleeps on their tummy through the nightyou will wake up with a wet baby and wet sheetseverythinguse pampers swaddlersat least until after size  as that is the largest size swaddlers they make for some reason you can thank me later baby dry  wet baby.
leaks at my kids belly especially during his sleep or nap which is totally unacceptablepampers swaddlers huggies and even costcos kirkland signature dont have this issue this diaper is good for daytime only we bought huggies for night time or napsvery disappointing.
wellwe never had any issues with pampers brand of diapersweve tried all other brands cheaper  expensive ones and nothing comes close to diapers.
from testing all kind of brands from every store possible pampers baby dry is far most the best out there.
i loved this item but i gonna move out of the country  so i had to cancel my baby never had problem with these diapersthanks.
not as soft as pampers swaddler but i prefer them to the regular huggies and like them equally as the huggies little snugglers which are much more expensive very absorbent never got a leak with them and my baby sleeps for  hours at night.
dont get confused here this isnt a swaddler style diaper there is no i repeat no wetness strip this diaper came up when we searched for swaddler and its our mistake for not reading closer the diaper is a bit small in size compared to the swaddler ones and the lack of wetness strip makes it an easy nd place choice to the same size pamper swaddler.
we didnt like these at all i am a big fan of swaddlers and these are nothing like the soft meshy swaddlers these are crunchy and thin like storebrand diapers with swaddlers i could easily let my  month old go overnight without a diaper change but these leaked all over the front of me when i picked him up in the morning hated them.
it takes a lot for me to dislike a product but these are terrible after a half hour the diaper would sag and look like it was extremely wet when in reality there was hardly anything in it they dont seem to hold much before leaking even doubling the diapers for overnight still doesnt prevent leakage definitely not something i will ever purchase again no matter how good the price is.
my almostmonthold has never had any diaper other than a pampers diaper on his body i swear by pampersbut even though they are less expensive the baby dry type are not worth it i found them cheap looking and feeling they could have been mistaken for a store brand the absorbancy in the seat of the diaper was so bad my son would wake up from a short nap and the seat of his outfit would be wet there was not a fit issue he was the correct weight for the size i bought and the leakage was not from the top of the back or sides of the diaper but literally from the seat from now on i will definitely stick with the pampers swaddlers type.
i bought these diapers after using the pampers swaddlers and these are the worst diapers ever the smell of urine seeps through the diapers also they do not absorb at allnot worth the savings.
there are less expensive diapers out there but i found that pampers and huggies might be more money but are the better diaper too i also found that baby dry diapers were the least expensive of the diapers that work i have a girl and they work great i really dont even price check anymore i just get these using amazon mom and subscribe and save and get them as cheap as i can i lot easier shopping for diapers when you have your favorite and these are definitely my favoriteedit october  i now have another baby girl i decided to give luvs a try again and like them this time around i didnt like them with my first daughter not sure if my opinion changed or if luvs changed their diaper up there is definitely a different feel than other brands but after amazon mom ended i started shopping again and now i get luvs from sams club.
we liked the swaddlers now that my daughter is older we needed protection and switched to huggies snug and dry.
after hitting the end of the line with pampers swaddlers which max out in a size  we figured baby dry was the logical next step every time our daughter pooped it came right up the back and on to her outfit her mother the sofayou name it she is right in the size range we will not be buying this diaper again.
i have  boys and have always alternated for price between pampers and huggies both diapers have gone downhill in the last  months they have less absorbency the top of the diaper in the front constantly explodes and overnight is out of the option the strip is not as wide to catch urine its been cut down constantly waking up with both my twins soaking wet the diaper has exploded and the more generic absorbing material sticks to everything weve had to change out the sheets clothes and anything else everyday several times the diapers have ripped apart so bad they needed immediate baths from all the gel coming out ive grown more concerned that since its coming out so bad its coming out of the buttons of their clothes and them eating it is this a ploy to get people into buying the almost  times more expensive overnights i dont know but they certainly arent what they have been for the last  years.
these daipers are no good to use always leaks and gives diaper rash not worth the money pampers swaddlers are much better than these daipers.
baby dry was okay until my daughters poop got bigger it leaks we even have to change her pants and bodysuits everyday i was very frustrated then i changed to pampers cruisers with dry max which is a little bit expensive than this one it worked perfectly no leaking and no washing of clothes any more but if your baby is not a big eater as my daughter baby dry was okay you just have to change often though.
these diapers are the best i cannot say enough about them in my opinion they are much better than huggies and fit true to size i feel that huggies run really small they are also so soft i feel confident using them on my babies sensitive skin i will use these again with my next baby.
pampers makes the best diapers with the most varieties for your needs however their collect points promotion is misleading by the time you save up any worthwhile points your child will have outgrown the selection also the shipping and handling fees out weigh the cost at any store dishonest and mean spirited next child will use lesser quality diapers but from a company with more integrity.
i wish swaddlers went up to my sons size he is  months old and already weighs  lbs these are good but swaddlers in bigger sizes would be ideal i have not yet tried the cruisers but based on ratings these seem to be what most prefer i have not had any problems with these excet my son outgrows them so fast each shipment i order it seems i have to go up a size love pampers products.
ive tried many diapers over the years and ive found that pampers are the best they fit well provide the right amount of ventilation so our babies dont get a rash and they hold a lot of liquid my only complaint is the price they are so darn expensive.
when my son wheres pampers the poop always rides up his back i am very disappointed in these diapers and cant believe all the positive reviews i gave it  stars because it does hold in pee alright for  hours max these diapers dont perform as well as huggies snug  dry.
this product is wonderful  and the best fit for our baby we tried swaddlers because of a friends recommendation but our  month old got rashes within the first week of using it we switched back to baby dry and the rash was gone within  days  definitely recommended by me.
i love pampers swaddlers so i thought id try these once my baby outgrew the swaddlers while ive never had any issues with leaking ive had to throw out at least four brandnew diapers so far because the the entire side where the tab tears off while im trying to fasten the diaper ive never had this problem with swaddlers or huggies so i know its not the operator also these diapers dont seem to fit very securely they tend to sag and feel very cheap even my husband commented on that and he generally doesnt notice these kinds of things ive only used about  diapers from my box of  but im sure ill have more problems with tearing what a waste.
these diapers are too expensive and leaky than other diapers usually i dont buy them because of high cost but i bought them for the first time thinking that they will be gud but they were the oppsosite they leak if you forget to change a diaper before the baby sleeps i usually use luvs diapers they are far betther than these and cheaper as well i made a great mistake thinking that if it is expensive it will be goodpeople dont waste your money in this junk product.
these do a very very good job huggies supreme hold a bit more liquid but for the price the best you can get actually like better than the pampers cruisers and they cost less with the amount in the box  one case is good for almost a month rarely leak  even w a  year old at night.
the diapers were fine except my order was for  diapers and i only received  i also didnt have any way of contacting the shipper to let them know that my order was incomplete.
we got a big box of baby dry from amazon our experience is that my sons clothes are soaked with just a small amount of liquid on the other hand the swaddlers take on a ton of liquid and my son stays dry as a bone and so do his clothes we are sending these back as defective and ordering more swaddlers.
we have tried several brands of diapers and definitely prefer pampers for our son they fit him best and we very rarely have explosions this box is a great value.
pampers baby dry size  diapers economy pack plus  countive made a huge mistake buying these diapers i thought it is a good deal and i can save some money but when i received these pampers baby dry diapers i opened the box and i find out that all of them has a little tiny brown stain on the back since it was the first time i got these diapers i guessed it shoudve been this way so i put one on my  month and half baby girl when it comes to change her diaper i was really shocked her butt and all the diaper area was in terrible red color and she had the worst rash so far i put several pastes and cream to treat it it took almost  day to get rid of them finally she had been using this particular diaper like for  hours and for this little time it caused this terrible reaction i dont understand how can people sell such a product especially baby stuff has to be carefully examined do not repeat my mistake never buy these diapers .
a lot of people are writing about the size not being accurate  the size of the s are the same as the s but i noticed that the s have a blue liner i am wondering if theyre intended for babies who need the size of the s with the absorbancy of the s does anyone else know pampers doesnt have anything on their website.
i have been using pampers babydry diapers since zach was only a few weeks old these are the only diapers i will use on him they are soft and comfortable for him i cant say there was never an incident of a leaky diaper but i would love to meet the mom who has never had a diaper mess at one point or other lol i have tried other diapers but these seem to be the most comfy and best control against diaper accidents.
the diaper is too thin that it hardly holds anything we found we literally had to change the diaper for our kid every hour interestingly the same pamper diaper we bought from local supermarket or walmart store was a lot better and could last for several hours.
we tried pampers baby dry on vacation and our had leaks at least once and up to four times per day our one year old baby is a size  and doesnt have any problems in swaddlers cruisers or other store brand diapers i couldnt believe how leaky these were.
i purchased these baby dry thinking we could step up from the pampers swaddlers i was wrong i just assumed they would be as good as the swaddlers but they are not my baby girl is  months and is an average babynot chunky or big other reviews mentioned it may have an impact on the diaperhere are my consdo not absorb like i need them to she is up one to two times per night and if i dont change her at one of the feedings by morning she will be in a puddle and i will have to wash everythingthey are not nearly as soft as swaddlers when she is really wet the inside of the diaper will come apart and stick to herit is a stringy something that sticks to her legsyuckthey really are fine during the day it is at nap and night time that she seems to over flow out of the diaper i will not order another box of these i was honestly shocked that they were not better because i really love pampers oh well live and learn.
my kid is enjoying  daiper takes lot more time than other ones and still will be fresh and dry.
we found this diaper undependable leaky and cant take an average load liquid or solid difficult to manage the night shift when his clothes and the sheets get wetprefer swaddlers any day.
i already have good luck with pampers so far no complaints people who are disappointed that there is no blue line i thought it would make them like those i used to then i figured out the blue line only instead of pampers swaddlers pampers diapers in the dry i have started to buy diapers through amazon only because if you use amazon subscribe and save discount they are cheaper than you can get even at a substantial discount in membership stores.
my little man sleeps  hours a night and these are the best diapers for leak protection if you do the amazon mom subscribe  save its an even better deal than cheapo diapers with subscribe and save i get a box of these each month delivered to my door so fantastic  worry free highly recommend.
i like the price and quantity in the package but im noticing now that they are holding up overnight ive recently changed to a more absorbent diaper at night.
probably my nd favorite disposable i find them to be very reliable and they smell nice however the scent does concern me and while all disposables contain chemicals i wonder about the more so when im using scented pampers regardless combined with subscribe and save this is a total winwin the price and service cant be beat im a parttime cloth diaper user and subscribe and save has made filling in the gaps very easy i cant say enough how much i love it.
i normally buy pampers cruisers i will not buy these again they seem really cheap plastic like i dont like the smell yuck cant wait for the jumbo pack to be done.
i ordered the economy pack of pampers baby dry size  and i love pampers although the size is a little small for  it was very convenient and nice sized i will order this product again.
i havent really strayed from pampers since my son was born  each time we borrowed a diaper from a friend or went on vacation and had to use another brand they didnt work as well tabs not restickable not as absorbent etc and we went back to pampers i discovered baby dry because we were in mexico and that was the type of pampers they had in the costco there  baby dry is great  they are thin and super absorbent amazon is the best place to buy them  especially if you use subscribe and save.
ive looked at quite a few different places to get a good price on diapers and amazon has been the best same price as my local stores but they get delivered right to my door free shipping i calcuate the price per diaper and amazon is always the cheaper or equal to other siteslocal storesas for the diaper itself i love pampers brand for diapers not wipes over any other diaper brand i prefer the baby dry over the cruisers for price and quality and now that they make the baby dry with the caterpillar stretch sides theyre even better they fit like a dream even on my skinny little boy my  month old son has been in pampers since the day he was born and any leaks are very very rare even overnight when hes sleeping  hoursi am very priceaware and amazon and pampers fit my budget perfectly.
i bought the xl case of pampers baby dry in size  and after only  diapers my son has a horrible rash on his entire back where the diaper touchesmy sons skin is not sensitive and we have used pampers swaddlers hugggies snugglershuggies snug n dry parents choice and comforts kroger brand and he has never had any issuenow i am stuck with this xl case of diapers.
we used pampers sensitive swaddlers for my son but by the time he was size  they did not work the swaddlers didnt have good protection and he would poop out of them we decided to try baby dry they are awful every diaper he either pees or poops out of now i am constantly washing his clothes and going through at least  outfits a day i am really not happy with baby dry i loved pampers but a friend of mine told me she had same problem with the larger sizes of pampers and had to switch to huggies .
weve been getting pampers baby dry from a wholesale club for a while now with no problems my son is  months in size  i saw the price on amazon and with the  off it was a great deal however when the box arrived the diapers smelled awful  chemicallike i gave them a day to air out which they did but in the next few days of using them my son has developed a terrible diaper rash he has only had tiny rashes  times in the past but this one is continuous and awfullooking we are discontinuing use of these particular ones immediately and going back to the wholesale club i dont think its baby dry per se but the shipment that amazon has it really upsets me that they would offer inferior diapers at such a reduced price  they need to be tossed and never touch a babys skin.
when you subscribe i recently subscribed to this product and it really does make a difference in price i recommend if youve got little pamper babies to just go ahead and subscribe to this product  i saved a bit even with my first shipment happy mommy.
wonderful product at a great deal from amazonbabies will luv themall stars i am in for repeat orders for the pampers diapers.
it is better to buy in bulk like this than the small one i saved a lot of money and didny worry to run out of diaper anytime soon.
this is the best diaper i have found next to the old pampers cruisers they are not as soft as id like and they dont have a liner like id want but they dont leak even after a  hour night with my heavy wetter they are more economical than the new pampers cruisers and i think probably a better diaper overall anyway.
these pampers were the worst my son was soaked every nighti switched to o overnight ones which are great no leaks.
loved this product for my baby i have enough diapers for her and they work so well controlling her during the night.
i liked these the best when my baby was  lbs but now at lbs he leaks through every one of them in  hours or less the s fit a little too big and i know hes almost ready but these are supposed to be good to lbs and they are not i have almost an entire case of these that i am donating because i dont trust them size  of sams club brand is working way better than these and cost less too.
these diapers leek up the back when my baby poops then got to waste time and change her shirt with poop and whatever else the poop got on annoying.
i love these diapers i have been using it for my son during the day with the discounts and and all others amazon coupons i got this for a very decent price i think  discount is very good its been almost a month and i still have half of the box to be used.
my daughter was wearing the huggies prior to this i ordered this diapers thinking that they would be softer and more absorbent than the huggies to my surprise they are neither softer or more absorbent im very disappointed and have had to change many skirts and pants because of thisi am planning on writing to kimberly clark as well regarding this also these diapers run small.
target diapers are much better than these diapers my daughter sleeps through the night when she wakes up her dress the sheet everything will be wet this diaper is ok to use during the day times but definitely not at night.
walt whitmans literary reputation has been hyped by gay critics i suspect im not totally hostile to free vers.
this book of poetry covers some very heavy stuff at the same time the subject matters cover a lot of matters that ive wanted to read for a whilei suggest that you do not read his poetry silently say it all out loud theyre meant to be read loud and proud trust me thats worth it.
this edition does not contain a table of contents which makes it impossible to navigate and totally useless overallsave your dollar and look elsewhere.
a coworker gave this book to me he was more of a fan than i but whitman grew on me and over the next several months i learned to appreciate his workhowever i left this book above my toilet and was disturbed that a relative of mine snooped through it while taking a dump discovering secrets that this coworker and i had together i now regret ever having read this silly book and am planning on burning it.
in my opinion this dvd did not contain any worth while figure skating coverage my five year old was in tears because we could only find five second clips of actual skating to make matters worse there doesnt seem to be anyway to access the actual skating events even if one is willing to pay for it nor does the olympic website itself have videos of the events i could understand if we were searching the week of the olympics or even that month however its been close to a year shame on you nbc the olympics are not yours.
ok i read the other reviews for this movie and i am a little confused was it the same movie the martial arts were ok in this but nothing i havent seen done better before the storyline was ummm well nevermindoh and did i mention the film doesnt end i mean i didnt really care but it still sucked to cut the story line half way thoughi really wantedto like this movie but the only good thing i can say is that some of the subtitles are hilarious.
the surround sound on this disc in nonexistent there is no center channel on the multi channel layer if you are serious about multi channel recordings this is the worst  this label should be ashamed of itself to mislead the public into thinking this is some kind of new level in recorded music .
ive had my mw for over a year when st received after turning on it would work for  to  minutes and then cut off i tried removing and repluging in the power cord and it would work for a few minutes and then the monitor would again cut off then i tried a different approach i removed the power cord and squeezed the end that goes to the monitor with regular pliars since then the monitor has not turned itself off oncei believe that what was happening in my case anyway was the power cord connection at the monitor would heat up and expand and break the flow of ac squeezing the power cord with the pliars tightened up the connection allowing the cord to maintain contact i looked at the monitors plug hole after removing the power cord and the connection lugs were inset into the monitor farther that i think they should be i think that that caused the problemdont know if this helps anyone elsethat is the only reason i dont give this monitor a  rating.
i bought this  months ago i purchased a refurb unitwell about  months ago the ps started to act up later its working again many people have experienced this problem with the ps.
so i tried this on a few things attaching a leather strap to a suede bag i made repairing leather sandal straps and trying to repair a shoe sole the leather strap pulled off the sandal repair came apart on vacation and the shoe sole didnt adhere properly so it started to come off when i pulled on the side that was coming off it pulled off in one big chunk it seems like the glue sticks very well to itself but not to the other materials you are trying to attach and yes i followed all of the instructions to a t still looking for a better shoeleather glue.
the glue was easy to apply my boyfriend attached it to his boots which were coming apart in some places  unfortunately the spot needing to be fixed wasnt one that could be fixed and the fix did not stay.
works great for repairing soles that start to come apart it is very durable and extends the life of shoes that need minor repairs highly recommend.
shoe goo works great the bottom of my tennis shoe was peeling i applied some shoe goo and glued the sole back on and let it dry  hours next day the tennis shoe was good shoe goo really works for the size i should buy a smaller shoe goo.
i learned a lot about audrey hepburns childhood that i had never realized before beginning in wwii brought the story home and made it real.
great book for anyone interested in true crime and the criminal mind john douglas looks at some classic crime cases using his profiling method look at the facts of the crime and draw conclusions about what kind of person could have done it this is in contrast to the approach of identify a likely suspect then identify facts of the crime that fit the suspect the author does not claim to solve all of the cases he studies in this book but rather point us in the right direction for example he describes the likely personality characteristics and behavior of jack the ripper interestingly this does not seem to match patricia cornwells conclusion and the zodiac his discussion of the ramsey case is probably the most controversial since he was personally involved in the case a well written and interesting book.
a dummys guide to understanding bizarre murder casesi would read this if you were a new immigrant to the western world so i would look around for weightier books on a specific crime topicthis book is too broad and not informative enough the reason why these cases haunt the fbi is that they need to turn on the lightswitch.
i dont typically read this kind of work but picking it up at a real bargain price it looked interesting given all the media attention this renown profiler receiveshis analysis of this collection of unsolved mystery murders showcases his analytical abilities honed over years of work he primarily spends a great deal of time on two key areas context of area in which crime committed and victomologyfrom jack the ripper to jonbenet ramsey he applies all that years of working the toughest cases has brought to himone that fascinated me the most was the one i knew the least the lindbergh kidnapping the missing chisel the removed flooring all this pointing to the convicted one also that gen schwartzkopfs relative was involvedthese cases do hold our yearning to solve mystery especially that where justice is sought and all can see if their hunches play out.
had this cd years ago and it was stolen from my car along with all other music the ccm being played today cant hold a candle to this beautiful musical offering clay crosse is amazing.
the stones are a bit small and not as colorful as the picture but the necklace is beautiful and well made interesting clasp with a nonrolling chain nice.
this is a very poor quality necklace i needed to take it in direct light before i could see any stones nothing like picture shown no bill in the box so sadly i am unable to return.
the product was in a very old box and the acdc connection was just a bare wire so i did return this item.
my cd of cassies me and you skips throughout the cd this is the nd time ive received a cd from amazon that has skipped this will be the last time i order any cds from amazon this is very frustrating as i feel ive spent my hard earned money on thisthanks for nothing.
i had to quickly find a dress to go to a wedding and i was distressed by how little i could find in my size readily available on the web or in stores amazon was the last place i looked and this is the first thing that popped up and its perfect it fits its appropriate and its cheap and fast if youre plus size and tearing your hair out over how slim the pickings are especially if you have an ounce of taste and dont like the traditional plus size color paletteprints this is your solution also the only alternatives i found were all special order at least two months ahead gowns hello who does anything two months ahead any more if time is not a luxury you can afford this is your solution as well.
this is the soundtrack to the classic playstationgame if features all the songs from the game plus all the instrumental music cues the songs most of which are rap songs are really cute and amusing the instrumentals are similarly cutesy and almost all of them are under a minute long a few are less than ten seconds long if you are a fan of this game im sure you will enjoy the soundtrack.
when my  year old niece was diagnosed with brain cancer last year my family was devastated her parents are both rns and so could more easily understand a lot of the terminology and treatments i have absolutely no medical background and i found this book to be very helpful this book provided comprehensive explanations of various treatments commonly used drugs different types of brain and spinal cord tumors etc that were easy for a layperson to understand i also really liked that there were many shared experiences from other families who had dealt with childhood cancer it made me feel like we werent alone there are new treatments that come out all the time so obviously some of the information may be dated but overall i thought this was an excellent guide for anyone caring for a child with brain cancer.
i am not very pleased with this product for a couple reasons first off this product did not teach me much of the italian language which is its whole purpose secondly i felt very lost from one part to another it just seemed very unclear as to what i was always supposed to be doing my advice is to consider a competitors product before this one a good alternative product to look at would be italian now by transparent language which is very well done.
absolutely wonderful video my preschoolers love it and now go around playing bibleman the hero they shout out word power to fight bad guy this is a great improvement from playing slash and shoot themup the price was great.
the original patton motion picture is a masterpiece and one of my favorite movies george c scott is a genius and one of my favorite actors i was happy to find this movie on amazon on demand but was disappointed with the movie itselflooks like a lowbudget made for tv movie which it iscasting was poor outside of george c scott these were a bunch of b or c actors richard dysart as eisenhower was particularly badas noted in many other reviews the video quality was poorway too long and way too depressingi was hoping this movie would cover more of the postwar patton and less of george c scott lying in a hospital bed if they cut off the last third of the movie it might be four starsi recommend you pass on this movie at the very least stop watching after the accident he suffers paralyzed in a hospital bed and dies there is nothing useful after that point and there is a lot of overacting.
love the book has many recipes in it i have used many of them and they not only taste good but do help u feel better.
the item came in record time and in perfect condition this was the second time that i have ordered this item and i will reorder it again in the future possibly in a different size.
the package contained just one stretched canvas and not  as the description claims i had to return this order as amazon cannot replace it for some reasons.
this film is actually four short films one film the robot fixer actually has little to do with technology or robotics as we usually perceive it lets play one of these films is not like the others while the others are very good speculative fiction pieces which make you go hmmm i thought that pak made the most use of his time and pulled the viewer into each story universe quite thoroughlyafter a week of working  hour days in the astrodome after the hurricane katrina survivors came in it was the perfect way to spend my first evening back with the family i highly recommend.
i was looking for a coffee machine with a thermal caraffe at first the cofee was great then a couple of weeks later coffee started to pour directly out of the machine onto the floor i thought maybe i had a bad machine so i took it back to the store and exchanged it for a new one a month later same problem the coffee pours around the caraffe not into it i burned myself trying to clean it up and it stained my nice kitchen floors im taking it back for a different brand coffee maker i wont be fooled three times.
i highly recommend this  version of the sherlock holmes mystery richardson suits the role of holmes very well bringing a confidence and intellectual flare to solving the casei cant be critical of much in this movie i enjoyed it immensely on vhs and now again on dvd its well acted well scripted and well produced i think ian richardson is my favourite sherlock holmes  although i dont think he played the role as many times as other actors again he brings such confidence in his ability that as a viewer you dont really think hes not going to solve the mysterythumbs up enjoy.
a wonderful and creative album great listening from start to finish belongs in every jazz library along with blue train giant steps and kind of blue.
im new to jazz and i find that i love this stuff i guess its bop this is a must have album for anyone i highly recommend i got it on vinyl which is still one of the best ways to hear music love it.
there are not enough stars in the sky and no words i can say here that will do it justice.
a love supreme was for john coltrane both an intensely personal statement and a gift to mankind on the brink of ruination due to alcohol and drug abuse coltrane had a life altering epiphany in  on the liner notes to the album he writesduring the year  i experienced by the grace of god a spiritual awakening which was to lead me to a richer fuller more productive life at that time in gratitude i humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through musica love supreme was recorded in  after the death of his friend eric dolphy and the birth of his st son these events must have inspired coltrane to create his masterpiece outside of bachs b minor mass i cant think of a greater work of pure spirituality in music whether or not you are into jazz you should listen to a love supreme at least once in your life.
i am enjoying its use the only issue is one of manufacturing the opening that allows for moving of the vibrate offon control does not align with the control it is difficult to move the control i modified the case by making a small cut to it.
not the greatest produce i have used the product for about  weeks and just recently took it off the cover fits nicely except for the holes on the side which i had to cut bigger it attracts lots of lint from your pockets i just havent really been pleased with it but for as cheap that it was i shouldnt really complain.
i bought this cd as a christmas present for my wife who is irishshe loves itso do i and im not irish.
a thoroughly wonderful movie that had me laughing in no time melanie griffith is outstanding in this zany story highly recommend.
i own another sony vcr slv n which is nice this one was for the kids but its going back the vcr is noisy  very distracting picture is fair i expect more from sony products.
its moody a little dark like for driving down the highway at night    but thats why i loved it in the s  i just was never able to find the cd  to me it is the most welldone wellproduced album by tommy shaw as i have heard most of his others to date    still yes it has a certain heavy keyboards sound but it is more serious than his other efforts in my humble opinion   so dark but great guitar it should have really been the concept for another styx album instead of the more lightwieght stuff they all have done   .
this album offers absolutely nothing worth wasting time with shaw had one minor  hit with girls with guns but nothing on this one people forget that shaw only contributed one top  hit too much time on his final three albums with styx before they broke up without nugent and blades his career may have ended here.
better than  tour  but guys need an up to date with current versions of your music  like a  dvdplease love them.
only buy this book if you want to feel your child is a loser its all your fault and theres nothing you can do about it ever im not even going to pass this book on its going in the trash that being said there are some great kids social skills books out there  the unwritten rules of friendship  nobody likes me everybody s me  good friends are hard to find.
i used the weights once well they almost made itone of the wrist weights came apart at the seam and sand leaked all over the carpet.
the wrist weight are one size that may be used by a very tiny and thin adult of  lbs or a child i could not get them over my hand to my wrist the advertising should say what size the hand needs to be and to use them.
the bulb seems ok the batteries have power but the laser light does not workthe bulb came in days.
it has been a month after the estimated date my items would have reached me and they havent can you check on this.
i love this dvd get ready to have fun and interact with your baby this dvd gives you so many ideas to have fun and interact with you baby by just using items you already have around your house i loved the bright colors the music eeebee and the mom i highly recommend this dvd to all parents.
i am so disappointed with the eebee dvd i bought it based on a review in parents magazine and also from the reviews posted here i feel eebee dvds are geared to children age  months when babies are just starting to move around little eebee could not hold my toddlers attention it was a waste of money for my  year old.
this guidebook is a waste of money  info is too scattered and does not address areas i will be visiting.
i liked the characters he did a great job of letting the reader get to know the characters however the plot was awful at the end i was left feeling like he just threw a bunch of words together just to end the book its almost as though youre left wondering exactly what happened at the end.
what else to expect from a cato institute publication they support the corporatism of space as the last frontier.
this album is a must have look for the similarities between sunny day and janes addiction in  million  i swear its there every track is incredible  be warned that listening to it in alreadysad states will lead to probably more sadness but its good to be there sometimes.
well i have to say that i didnt really want to write a negative sunny day review but then i thought of the unfortunate lads who would waste their money on this cd instead of buying a different sunny day cd i am a big fan driving  hours to see them play in a couple weeks but i was kinda let down by this one diary and selftitled are strongly recommended.
a am a huge sdre fan but to tell you the truth their new cd wasnt all that good their old stuff was way better sdre has lost their style and emotion this cd isnt worth buying.
although chekovs play accurately reflects the decline of aristocratic power in th century russia it is unfulfilling mdm ranevskayas orchard is bought under her feet by a friend whose hunger for profit motivated his friendship with her so this is the transformative moment mdm ranevskaya loses her most cherished possession and then what her friend lopahin feins innocense mdm ranevskaya runs off to paris to whom or what we never find out its sort of like biting into a pretty good apple only to have it fall on the ground.
i didnt say anything then because that has a very good chance of happening and there isnt really any way out once uncle frank gets you except holding your breath for a really really long time which might spoil the day for everyone else even though the ambulance would come and i would get to ride inside it while they saved my lifeverbatim quote of the authors writing abilities i myself had a hard time trying to understand some of these sentences  imagine my first graders annoyancerunon sentences mixed verb tense missing punctuation you name it the book should be called bad writing lessons the editor must have been out sick the day this manuscript was turned ingive it to a kid you dislike to repulse them away from readingbut the illustrations are nice so one star for that.
my daughter sadie and i love this book the author has a real knack for writing with the voice of a young girl this girl jane is smart and funny and spunky its a great story.
unfairly ignored during its initial release this movie deserves another chanceunlike most war movies this film concentrates not on battles but the heinous acts of some soldiers as they kidnap a girl rape and abuse hermichael j fox plays the one soldier who tries to stand up and do the right thingfox proves hes got what it takes to hold his own in a serious parteven better than bright lights big cityand sean penn is riveting as the soldier who takes things too fari saw this in theaters in  and it left me shaken and surprisingly years later it still hasnt lost its impactdirector brian depalma who usually makes stylish gimmick loaded films does a great job here with the serious subject matterthe haunting score by ennio morricone that accompanies the poor girls ordeal will stay in your mind for a very long timetough to watch but extremely worthwhile if youre looking for powerful cinema.
thank you for a textbook that was clean and in excellent condition.
an improvisation is wonderful if and this is a huge if an improvement on the original is made after listening to all  cuts i have to say that in every case the original is more enjoyable and satisfying to me to listen to can you really expect montero to improve on vivaldi that really is too much however if it is not as enjoyable as the vivaldi why would i spend money to listen to montero this revue is in no way a reflection on her pianistic abilities but it sure is a gripe about butchering classic source materialmy advice and it seems to be unique among reviewers so far is that if you like vivaldi listen to vivaldi not montero seeking to change vivaldi or bach or scarlatti or pachebelthe original is stunningthe alterations to it are just misc music.
not much new here i listened to it for the sarah song and it is what gave it two stars not horrible but the music is generic movie soundtrack music the two versions of you got a friend in me add nothing to the song when she loved me is a nice song performed wonderfully by sarah mclachlan but not enought to spend money on this whole cd.
this soundtrack is truly a piece of art randy newman has done some great things with this album when she loved me is a beautiful song that i cant help but listen to over and over again the instrumental part which makes up the majority of the album is exciting yet very soothing and enjoyable if youve seen the movie and paid any attention to the music at all the soundtrack is a must i put it in my cd player sit back and relax ill listen to this one for years to come.
i was not able to purchase because of mistake in pricing and advertisinig may try later the company contacted to advise of this mistake.
this book takes each book of the bible and gives a background on the setting in which it was written the author puts all the information in very understandable words it does give one an understanding of the times when the writing takes place it is necessary for those who know nothing about the history of the writings of the books of the bible it is more of a reference book than an easy readit is a good book for understanding sections of the bible and explaining them to others good for rcia groupsdonna murphy.
the author is quite talente.
steve berry is one of those writers you love to read  from the getgo you are part of the ride each one of his works is a given that it will entertain and get you thinkingsecret deals with the message the holy virgin gave to the children at fatima has some of the grace of angels and demons but not the wild ride of an ending although a satisfactory onedefinitely worth reading.
although berrys bad guys are pretty unconflicted about being bad guys especially for priests and the reveal regarding the third secret of fatima is jarring more for its anachronistic feel than for its content this yarn is similar to dan browns angels and demons in its look at the inner workings of papal enclaves and backstage vatican politicking it starts just a bit slow but has a satisfying buildup of suspense and twists so as to make it a reasonable pageturner for those who wont get too hung up on the undertone of criticism for the current catholic church and its various doctrines while there are some odd character choices and a bit of inconsitency about how urgent various things are and arent along the way i found myself entertained and turning pages and after all isnt that really the point of a mass market thriller donald j bingle author offorced conversion.
this is the first of steve berrys books that ive read i liked it so much that i bought all the novels by him that i could lay my hands on from my favorite local used books store it is action packed and well researched i admit that the conclusion of the book seems a bit far fetched his depiction of the vaticans intrigues do not seem very far from the truth though except perhaps for the murder parts it is the kind of novel that i find perfect to relax at the end of the day or on vacation.
theres about  minutes of horror film but the rest of the  hours is made up of  confused people trying to come to terms with their histories which are related to the horror story portion by analogy and the mans brief contact with the dead children there was supposed to be a psychological reason behind the horror  but it didnt strike me as particularly insightful instead it was dreary the acting even by jun ji hyun was dreary the actions by the characters were dreary the only sign of life comes from the fiance  a strong dynamic performance by attractive yu seonto see jun ji hyun at her best i recommendmy sassy girldaisy oril mare.
strikes me as too soon to produce reliable history about a period so recent he seemed a hair rightofcenter but at least didnt fall into the mythology of reagan winning the cold war he mentions clinton as slick a couple times but in his previous  history i dont think memory may be wrong he ever used tricky dick or slippery richard about nixon.
while im a big fan of this collection along with the continuing collection  id be really interested in knowing if jsp is planning on putting out a collection of cabs  stuff if such a collection exists from jsp  im just being ignorant please let me know.
there have been others books similar to this one but nearly all of the authors of those books have been trained directly or indirectly by ron legrand he is truly the guru of real estate investing this book gives solid practical advice that works in the real world yes he tries to sell you additional things but all you have to do is follow the instructions and you will have successa great book that opened my eyes to a world of possibilities which included early retirement.
the candy we received was not edible it had long ago expired we requested a refund but it never came through avoid this vendor.
this is the only brand of lory food our flock will accept its fruity smell and apparent good taste are the first thing our lories want in the morning and they get very excited waiting for their individual bowls to be passed out.
full of very interesting info which we probably never needed to know bought for a  year old who really liked some of his previous books.
got this to have at my sons house when i visit i love it they love it too easily set up never miss a show again.
i like every thing about my tivoexcept it is so busy running around the networks finding things to record some thimes i want to record the end of a movie or program im watching and i have to go into the programing an stop it from recording it has found before i can record what i want.
the series will record only one nondigital station and one digital now that comcast has gone alldigital your series has become more like a series since it only records one channel at a time.
this model tivo is out of date it will only record digital and analog programs and not hi def you must have a multichannel tuner card installed in order to receive cable tv channels  this costs month plus a  installation charge from comcast  plus the monthly charge from tivo is  as i recall  this is an expensive propositionim returning the tivo because comcast offers their hi def dvr for  for  moths then  there afteroh did i mention that if you have vonage or cable telephone service that you must buy a wireless adapter for this is not only an outdated piece of equipment but a very expensive solution to recording tv programsmovies.
i ordered the tivo and it was shipped the next day friday i received it in less than a week after i ordered it when i got it it was missing the remote after contacting the seller he ordered a new remote and had it sent to me as well as a howto book just for the inconvenience that i encounteredvery good customer service i would order again from this seller any time.
when i bought the tivo i was told that this item would tape  different programs at the same time when it didnt work i called that company and they told me that because i had directtv it was impossible to use the tivo like i wanted to i was totally cheated i then bought the directtvs type of digital recorder and its the best thing ive ever done it records  different programs at exactly the same time tivo told me that it only works on cable bah humbug this is not explained when you want to buy the item buyers beware.
i do not have any problems with amazonbut i have problem with firewallsalesnew yorki had return this tivo almost three weeks ago i had wrote tothem and i told them that i had sent it back due they was going to charge me a monthi have dish tv and they harge only me  a month ihad wrote to them different times to see if they got my tivothey writeback to tell that they will let me knownow its going to a month and stillhave not resolved the problemi think that i am going to better businessin the state of new yorki am very upset with this companythey have nopride if they did they would of taken care of menoris.
i have long been a fan of muriel sparks truly enjoying her humor and style i liked her autobiography as well but this book is a great disappointment the characters are shallow in particular dr wolf is cardboard and scarcely believable there is a certain sense of haste events are barely sketched and it is all quickly brought to a conclusion without going into any detail a very thin book indeed which would probably have received much less attention if the author did not have such a reputation.
i was really surprised that there was another nevada book by zane grey i had originally wanted another copy of the first book nevada but when i saw this one i just had to buy it thanks.
its sad but it happens  bootleg cds get put up for sale on amazon and they cant remove them fast enough i commented on two other bootleg sales and cant find them any longer obviously amazon took them down and new identical ones came and took their place some people just dont have any shame at allif youre going to call on amazon to remove these cds you should rather suggest that they blacklist the seller remove any means to buy the item and mark it as fake that way no customer would ever have to be fooled again.
this cd isnt too bad but at the same time i wish i hadnt bought it i think the singer said to himself lets see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally and in a realllly bad way oddly enough the absolute best song these guys ever put out isnt featured on either of their cds sweet summer besides the fact that this is missing that gem of a song its nothing like the first cd nothing quite like the cathy pop rhythms of dont stop on this cd just kinda bland soft rock i recommend downloading sweet summer as it is their best song by far and perhaps possibly buying the first cd but dont waste your time on this one.
i purchased this book over a year and a half ago and i have yet to win big i have studied this book from cover to cover and use it with lottohow to wheel a fortunealso by gail howard anyone who considers purchasing either book should know that the majority of the jackpot winners in her testimonial section are from the late eighties in theory lottery master guide appears to offer a variety of proven systems to beat the odds but sad to say i do not feel it lives up to its claims i personally would advise you to save your money and not purchase either book.
difficult to win anything on your own  outlay by individual players is too large better start a pool at the office with coworkers and collect funds in order to play any of her wheeling systems youll share winnings and losses small and both sides unless you hit the jackpot no other book comes close get your rabbits foot or any other totem for luck youll need it.
give it up everyone rammstein is dead this album is so soft it doesnt even deserve to be a german based cd not even rosenrot can save this albumthey have soldout producing a soft numetal tainted record that cant compare to their other amazing albumsrip rammstein.
thurber revealed the secret life of walter mitty dubar should have kept his life a secret unrevealeda lot about the drinking and useless meanderings of jules dubar written in a painfully simplistic and predictable style dubars life is not interesting except in the fact that a highly educated man so often behave so coarsely but geologists often took pride in that kind of behavior back when very macho those guys save your money or toss it in a river but avoid this book.
one bushing fits the other doesnt i chose to make it fitwill implode into itself seeing as its brass and squeak to caboose but its better than your door not shutting.
i was pleased that i got my parts so quickly but after removing my door to replace the bushings and pins i discovered that one of the two identical packages contained a incorrect bushing this incorrect part caused the job to take about twice as long since i had to stop and make a bushing maybe next time ill just make the bushings and not bother with the parts made in china.
buffy the vampire slayer is the best television show on television and if you missed the first season you can catch up on what happened now with these awsome videos it is good formatted and is a must for a buffy fanatic like myselfall of the books are good too.

i believe al ristori to be a well respected fisherman who normally shares valuable information in a cut to the chase mannerbut this book fails to live up to that reputationit is definitely not a  complete guide to saltwater fishing almost all of the information presented in the book is cookie cutter and generic information that can easily be found on the net for freethis book was clearly not a labor of love and al merely put his well know name on it to bank some coinand has disappointed me in the process.
i found the book itself to be interesting and entertaining however i attempted to write a paper about it for school but there is no publisher information or translator i do not suggest this version of the book for students planning to use it in papers.
i was looking for some more advanced features than were offered but it looks like it will be helpful to me moving forward i build alot of forms in adobe acrobat if you have never done javascript in acrobat or have intermediate knowledge it may be a helpfull book for you.
this book would have been better if the couples were switched though to tell you the truth i dont understand why bridig was even in the book she was extremely irritating brodick was also another irritating character i mean like some kind of wild caveman i liked gillian and ramsey and think they would have made a better couple this is her first book where i think she overwrote the male lead this is the first book ive read by jg that i wasnt crazy about but gillian ramsey ian and judith made up for the shortcoming with this one.
i absolutely loved this book and could not put it down the heroine  gillian  was full of courage and didnt back down when faced with problems laird buchanen  the hero  is all man  but you can feel how much he cares for gillian at the same time  there are  or  other storylines taking place that culminate in the resolution of gillians main problem  will she get to see her sister does she find the treasure how will she get alec to his home after he is kidnapped who is the traitor to the sinclairs and more i read this book in  sittings  and it left me feeling happy.
in the chapter on pets zahn lists euthanizing your companion as an option if fido or kitty will not take kindly ever to your baby pthis struck me as rather compassionless especially for a book about parenting she could have mentioned the possibility that some pet owners may have to find new homes for their companions and left it at that.
this isnt just a history book laced with photo.
i bought this dvd almost a year ago i finally decided to use it and i am happy that i did i did find the dvd very helpful the workouts are not long and there are some rest periods throughout each workout in my opinion workout  is the hardest i am not a fan of burpees at all but they do get easier i do not really rest during the breaks if i need a rest i take it if not i fast forward to the next section overall a great workout i will probably get her next dvd i am new to the kettlebell thing and i am using a  pound bell this seem like just the right size for a beginner.
i cant believe how awful this movie was and i love zombie movies it was like watching a syfy movie of the week waste of  sucked.
well if you are looking for a synopsis of the series look at disk this is probably one of my faovrite animes and its about time they brought it to the usawell now the important notes this series dvds as with most anime series dvds are being released every other month the doll that comes with the set has her feminine features far to over accentuated i think mile long legs are great but  mile long legs just get the regular dvd and save yourself a  spot.
biotutor is an invaluable tool for any student taking ap biology or struggling in a biology class last year i took regular biology and did very well i think my average was an a or a but thinking i was such a good biology student i took ap it was not the same their is more math in it than i expected but thankfully i found biotutor and am now a great bio student.

after reading reviews about every small wine cellar offered through amazon i ordered this item hoping it would work it arrived damaged the cellar was sent ups in just its original box no extra packing to protect it the plastic around the door was cracked the door was also hanging at an angle i actually considered keeping it even with the damage so i plugged it in and tested the temperature with a refrigerator thermometer no matter what setting i put it on the temperature remained at a constant  degrees which is too cold for storing red or white wine amazon made the return easy they sent ups to my house to pick up the item i was very discouraged about the idea of ordering again i finally ordered a magic chef wine cellar through home depot it arrived well packed and seems to be working just fine.
educating rita can be enjoyed at many levels of understanding it can simply bring pleasure and good feelings and it can be understood as a story of love that is harnessed for the growth of each person involved in the mentoring relationship for a woman who has to take her own journey it is validating for a stale and jaded teacher it is instructive for any love relationship that develops between student and teacher it shows  in the very best light  what can happen to each when they recognize the true purpose of their exciting and marvelous luck in being brought into each others lives that luck is nothing short of the transformation of both of themit is my wish that life could be lived more often at this level with passion determination humour guts and grace.

no wonder it sounds alot like helooween kai hansen and some other former members of helloween are in this band which is actually a sidehobbyproject for kai hansen and friends disgruntled with not being able to play s style power metal they formed this great band on the side of their regular bands like gamma ray and other bandsalso worth noting is the fact that theyve just released a track minicd coming home i bought it only yesterday and it needless to say rocks theres a live version of atlantis is falling the cover of judas priests the rage is also terrific.
easily one of the dopest cds of the year  but itll probably get slepped on because the haters are in full effect when it comes to no limit this cd can be listened to from the begining to the end without skipping a single song the beats are excellent even without beats by the pound the new production team is holding their own you got to feel cmurders maturity on this cd hes taking his game to a whole other level kblaqueputtin it down for nolimitsoldierscom.

marriott was the man and deserves to be remembered but the fact that he was one of the best rb vocalists this countrys ever produced means anyone trying to do his songs justice is probably with all the best intentions going to struggle steve ellis comes closest to hitting the notes the best of his tracks being song of a baker dennis greaves simon honeyboy hickling and midge ure all perform well both the tracks by deborah bonham are outstanding in particular if you think youre groovy which is easily the best thing on the album the tracks by wellergallaghermclagen et al are good but youd expect better as for tony rivers ripping the throat out of itchycoo park the less said about it the betterreview in brief good tracks   out of  best track if you think youre groovy deborah bonham worst track itchycoo park tony rivers worth buying yes because the good tracks make up for the bad ones.

for all of you that like english history with a twist of mystery than you will love the novella the daughter of time by josephine tey this is a mystery novel that deals a lot with english history and old kings and stuff whic is something that i just dont mesh with on a scale of one to ten i would have to rate this book a three the reading was a bit hard and i often found myself counting the pages until i was finished though i usually love mystery this one was definitely a disappointment on countless levels the book was written well and i think that if i had been a tad bit older and wiser on english history that i may have enjoyed it more overall i think that i would personally have to give the book two thumbs down.
of one of the oldest mysteries in england was thoroughly enjoyable the story is told in an intelligent manner and seems to logically solve the mystery until i read another theory on these two little princes i find more believable ill stick with this one.
ive given away at least a dozen copies i dont want to spoil anyones delight in reading but i will say that the content remains controversial debby goldstein.
did richard iii have the princes in the tower done in that is one of the great mysteries of history and tey solves it in the daughter of time some critics consider this the greatest mystery novel ever written and i concur have read hundreds of mysteries many of them marvelousbut the daughter of time is the bestthere are those who think christies the murder of roger ackroyd is best i dont because i had correctly figured out who the murderer was by page .
josephine tey takes us through a wonderful unraveling of centuries old history was richard iii the evil murderer of the princes  or noti think this book one of the most fascinating mixes of history and mystery two of my favorite areas and reread it regularly so when my book club asked me to recommend a mystery this was an easy choice backed up by its ranking as one of amazons best mysteries of the century well they hated it why bother solving a centuries old mystery so i offer this experience to say that this is a terrific book if you like mysteries or english history others may not care for it.
wonderfully written and hugely educational taking the reader from the theory of historical evidence to the stories of king richard iii.
these pajamas last only two months before the silk started to tear at the waist and in the crotch area for this price i would expect that they would have been much better quality and last longer than two months.
i recently bought these silk pajamas for my husbands birthday within a week all the button fell off the top and the fabric frayed    inches wide along the seams in the pants along the thighs i paid  dollars for these pajamas more than silk pjs listed from other suppliers on amazon expecting i was buying quality after a weeks use they are heading for the rag bag and i feel defrauded.
this arrived in a different package and bottle than shown the box has tear marks and is beat up it also has a nasty dirty spot where some sort of sticker was removed what a great looking christmas gift this will make.
i just wanted to add my voice to those who already mentioned the problems with paper feed not long after i bought this model but too late to returnit started having problems with the paper feed i now have to hand feed each piece of paper and even then it sometimes doesnt work the print quality is fine but what good is it if you cant get the paper in i now have to replace this new printer that was a couple of hundred dollars wasted.
this is the second hp printer i bought and frankly the only reason i tried this printer was because of the network connectivity i havent written many reviews before but this product is soo bad that i had to add to the list of angry customers getting the printer to load  piece of paper is a nightmare now i get paper jam warnings when there is no paper in the bloody machine anyone see office space yeah after i get my new canon printer i will reenact that scene perhaps i should record it and send it to hp.
i have actually not yet had the paper feed issue like the rest of the reviewers but this product has been horribly implemented i have continually had issues with attempting to install the  mb driver and hp solution center software on multiple different computers running different operating systems the scanner is about worn out as it makes a horrible grinding noise when scanning which started to occur within months of the purchase hp used to be known for their great quality in printers but this is unfortunately no longer the case do not buy.
to begin the software installation is a headache i had trouble installing it even though i work in it why do you need a mb  mb driver that requires you to turn off your antivirus during installation the printer jams often and will sometimes shutdown while printing while i think hp business grade printers are great this consumer grade printer is junk.
i am in complete agreement with the rest of you who have had paper feeding problems the printer was fine at first although difficult to set up software now a month later the printer either doesnt take the paper or jams it has nothing to do with the quality of the paper i am also surprised that this wasnt discovered in testing i also noticed that the ink cartridges keep getting smaller what a rip off i have had it with hp printers i will never buy another.
i bought this movie new but it will not play on my dvd player i have tried several other playersmachine to play this in  it will not work in any of them i am very disappointed with this product when i was looking at it on amazon it didnt say it was not compatable with any system.
why did you send a dvd that you are very sure it does not work here in the united states does it make any sense for you why dont ask us to be sure before send it to another country if you know that it wont work on that country.
it doesnt play in normal dvd players so idk where i could watch it i was looking forward to watching it.
ok maybe im exaggerating just a little maybe it didnt exactly take my breath away but it is an incredible dvd this is a real good movie however not exactly a phenomenon as steven speilberg claims in a brief interview on the dvd the dvd in itself with all the extra bonus materials is outstanding i found it to be very informative and very interesting to see how this movie was made and just how much dedication and extremely hard work it took just to get all the yearsworth animation included with the liveaction get it produced make countless sketches and finally get it out to the theaters well done very well done i couldnt be more pleased and more impressed with this special dvd release its definitely a musthave.
my grandmother bought this for me when i was  years old ive loved since then i havent watched it in a while so i decided to watch it one day when nothing was interesting on tv this movie bought back so many memories of when me my cousins who i havent spoken to since i was  and friends were little i knew every song and every line get this movie its a classic and a good movie for adults as well as kids you wont regret buying this.
super mario bros is a video game movie that is memorable in the way that may surprise you the witty dialogue and rapport between bob hoskins and john leguizamo as mario and luigi respectively make this film a real treat upon repeated viewings although it features a look that may remind people more of blade runner than super mario bros it has the same charm in its set design that other s sciencefiction films have such as total recall or demolition man the tone shifts all over the place from light and comedic to dark and frightening but the sheer inventiveness on display here make super mario bros worth a watch dennis hopper gives a performance straight out of a david lynch film in this one watch this flick and i guarantee youll be hooked on the brothers.
ok im not going to get into this movies lack of similarities to the video game.
not much i can say except that this movie is often riffed on for all the wrong reasonsyes the movie is indeed flawed in many respects but at the same time it has a lot of great set pieces music good dialogue good cg and animatronics and a a scene using joe satroni musicits just a fun movie worth riffing on if you hate it but a fun movie if you appreciate it for exactly what it is supposed to be a fun ride.
i am a big fan of the super mario brothers  the video game and the tv show i had high hope for this movie but boy what a waste of time this was this movie sure give the super mario brothers a bad name if you havent seen this movie i envy you nothing like the game of the show it never should have been mad.
i saw this movie way back when it came out in the theaters but that was so long ago so when i seen it on amazon i had to get it to see if it was as good as i remember it and it was better i tell you it is hard to even take it from the player i think its really good dennis hopper does a great job as koopa and the mario bros are great and for those of you who might think that the princesss name should be peach not daisy you are a little off the page the character of daisy first shows up in super mario land as luigis girl while peach is marios duh.
heres my problem while i do think we create a lot of our own problems in this life i dont think every single situation in life is one of our own creation to me saying that we create everything in our lives through our thought vibrations is saying that people in the world who are suffering are just not thinking correctly our experiences come to us because of our thoughts and beliefs really so for example the jews killed during the holocaust were just not sending out enough positive energy granted what the author is really talking about is much smaller situations in our everyday lives ones we can control but still this blanket statement about the power of thought really bothered me also i was looking for more concrete how to information which i found a bit lacking in this book i know the author was going for simplicity but i found the illustrations and exercises a bit too simplistic and not terribly helpful.
the best part about the ateam besides no one getting hurt the homemade weapons the team members personalities and the bad badguys was the music from the intro to face srenading his girldujour or murdock talking to his invisible dog to ba helping out at the youth center to the raging firefights and homemade weapons to the end credits the music in ateam was always appropriate for the setting and always good i love it when a soundtrack comes together.
this dvd came from england  would not play on my player so i have returned it  i am waiting on a credit i would not have ordered this had i know it was coming from england  that i might have a problem.
the acting is fantastic direction outstanding chilling in every sense of the word i love this movie one of my top ten.
yes devil conspiracy at its finestthis is a true ish classic and another epic from roman polanskihow the lifestyle of doris day becomes satanicthis devil worship genre was heavy stuff in the mid s coming as it did with the saga of sharon tate charles manson and polanski somehow tied into all of thisnonetheless murder is murder and this movie is the depiction of darkness lucifer evil with the premise of the birth of the antichristrosemary herself a witch not by choice battles endlessly with herself and her emotions as if reason could win this movie blurs all distinction between madness and reality as seen through the eyes of rosemarya truly remarkable groundbreaking flick that contrasts good and evil passion and reason a highly entertaining movie with a a great cast of future starsthe extras are good.
these are the bestknown hits from the bestloved shows  the songs you go home humming  and michaels gorgeous and evocative voice really delivers the goods love this tour of great moments on stage.
unlike most of the reviews here i was able to play this hd dvd without any problems i use my xbox  to play hd dvds which is able to automatically get any updates that are neededanyway the movie follows the stories of multiple italian people all of different ages and background as they embark on different milestones in their lives the video is full of beautiful shots with great hidef detail the narration really adds to the video as none of the people speak englishi definitely would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of italy my wife and i went there a few years ago and were happy to once again see places that we had visited.
these videos are fantastic from a documentary perspective but someone on the manufacturing crew screwed up the italy  austrailia disks do not buy until the problem is fixed  youll just have to send them back.
i only wish that more time was devoted to the natural beauty of italy and its citiestowns and natural coutryside particulary in the north as opposed to horse racing auto racing etc.
i just updated to the newest firmware   and the disc is now playable in my xa big relieve for all i hope review of the source to follow.
read the reviews about this disk not working figured they were old reviews and had fixed the problems very disappointed in that they are still selling this defective disk brand new xbox hd dvd player refuses to boot with this.
this cd player is a great one when it comes to travel and portability but only four months after i got it the headphones stopped working properly when they do work they dont work on the left side and you usually have to play around with it before it does but still its a great system nice audio quality too.
i was impressed with how mr philbrick was able to share just the right amount of detail when reading the narrative of the canniblaism i was just about to shout enough when he stopped the book flowed well and was never boring the explanations of whaling and the culture both in nantucket and on ship were well done the sadness of wrong decisions and how they can have such a devestating affect on others is something many of us can relate to as we make decisions throughout life i appreciated the epilogue but felt the extensiveness of the notes were unnecessary it was already evident that much research had gone into this book this book is certainly not for everyone those who are looking for a love story will not find it here it is a true story about people coping in an extreme situation and what they feel they must resort to.
this true story takes place in the early to middle s and its location on nantucket island and in the middle of nowhereasea you learn that looking for whales is a group effort and when one is found a grueling and dangerous activity to land it the ship essex was sunk by a whale and that was the inspiration for writing moby dick it is most interesting reading about the survival of a few and how they eventually made it back to land a pageturner.
this is one of my favorite books of all time the shocking sinking of the essex the inspiration for moby dick is only the beginning of what the author turns into a gutwrenching tale of a handful of sailors desperately trying to stave off starvation thirst and madness as they try to make it from the middle of the pacific back to south america philbricks writing is clear powerful and incredibly engaging its a hard book to both put down and get out of your mind after finishing it.
philbrick takes the reader on a journey like no other and explains each wave along the way i couldnt put it down i had a special interest in that my greatgreatgrandfather was a whaling captain master and traveled those waters with my greatgrandfather as a toddler on board my one criticism of the authors perspective is what he didnt critique  cannibalism i know it is easy to point fingers when i was not there starving and dying of thirst but the author went too far in the other direction and became their justifiers based on the accounts of two survivors who chose to eat their friends why was there not a serious discussion about chosing to die with dignity rather than deify life at the cost of eating and drinking your friends perhaps the men who died earlier did hold to this why was that not a significant part of this worknevertheless thank you nate philbrick for a book that should be made into a movie with some of this balance.
a bare facts historical account of the sinking of the essex by a sperm whale and the enfolding events after that the failure of the captain led to unnecessary loss of life when he gave in to his first mates influence to sail east in the small whaleboats in spite of his own gut feeling that they should sail west we may not like some of the decisions they made in order that some of them might have the chance to stay alive but we until we are in their shoes we cannot be judgmentalgreat book.
what a wonderful and often time touching story it is very hard to believe what those men went thru they were dealt one bad card after another and yet they still endured i recommend this book to everyone especially those who think that they have is bad.
the condition is somewhat less than perfect  but not muchthe book is wonderful fascinating story and very well researched and written.
this book is a wonderful story of the lives of the sailors on the whaling ships of the period their adventure on the ship essex as it left port sailing for new grounds  little was know about the islands of the pacific and in thisstory it was a sad effect that could have made their rescue shorter and saved some lives some parts of the story even though it was factual was too much detail in the death of some of the ship matestheir lives after their rescue i found interesting in the way that they personally found solace in the jobs theytook upi would recommend this book it was the chosen book by our book club of women and all found it interesting .
i havent read this book but i was wondering how this book stacks up with the penguin version the loss of the whale ship essex sunk by a whale from what i understand this novel is a retelling of events while the penguin classics is the actual accounts of two of the crew members im a bit torn as to which one i should readpurchase all comments are very much appreciated.
the sinking of the essex by a whale is probably most famous as the inspiration for herman melvilles moby dick but in in the heart of the sea the tragedy of the whaleship essex by nathaniel philbrick the reader will be engaged in an adventure more exciting than most works of fiction the author skillfully combines elements from the accounts of two survivors to locate the truth of the tale in addition one will become immeresed in the history of nantucket the whaling industry including graphic accounts of the hunt not for the faint hearted and other elements of this particular place and time in history an exciting read and a fine speciman of that popular creature the true survival story highly recommended.

i couldnt believe my eyes when i saw the amazingly low price for this product i guess i got what i paid for since these pills did not work at all the ingredients list the same as phazyme but offered no relief.
hepburn and tracy at their finest in the story of a female athlete and her shady agent an agent who turns out to be a good guy when he finds the right woman in the guise of hepburn hepburn got to display her range of athletic skills in this film alongside some of the great female golfers and men and women tennis stars of the sgreat film.
i must respectfully disagree with the  star rating for this cd the reason being is that i have never heard such muck up of vivaldis four seasons i have to admit i bought this cd purely for piazzollas  seasons and now i am convinced that i definitely must search for a different performance of it being almost certain that this one is not doing it justice.
anybody who is interested in learning about the beauty of sufism should not turn to this book this book in fact does not examine anything of intellectual spiritual or social value as related to sufism or islam i have come across many books written by socalled sufi masters who expound upon the complexity of the universe with inspirational imagery this is not one of them while books in this genre easily turn into polemics this one surely takes the unenlightened cake the stream of consciousness writing style lacks purpose in this setting and appears to have been an easy way out of organizing a coherent book of ideology.
very good book quick read good story and beautiful illustrations got this for myself to read but am going to have my yr old read it as well.
i was able to easily search for a wireless network and set up my tivo to my wireless internet works flawlessly.
if you cant connect your tivo using an ethernet cord then this is the next best thing this is the only wireless adapter that you should using if you own a tivo this adapter was specifically design for tivo.
making tivo apart of my wireless network was easy to do and now i can watch what is on either tivo no matter which room i am in.
bought this item for half or what a local computer store wanted worked right out of the box very good product.
quick to ship and arrive price better than from tivo only annoyance is that tivo requires a specialized wireless g usb adaptor.
got it opened it plugged it in entered my net info and bobs your flippin mothers sisters brother.
great product works extremely well my modem is in my basement and the adapter is upstairs i get an  signal strength highly recommend.
the setup requirement for the tivo wireless connector to my apple wireless network would require me to change the setup of all the other components on my network when tivo worked on the network my printer didnt it was less of a hassle to get an ethernet cable and plug it in.
i spent an entire afternoon trying to get this piece of junk to talk to my wireless network went through the steps a bazillion times  it found my network and could not get an ip address  after wep key entered customer service were on the phone with me for hours and i think it safe to say we tried everything their final suggestion was call your isp comcast who were unable to helpso  i bought a new tivo specifically to use on my network so i could broadcast my mp collection through my av system and cant add to the fact thatthe new tivo is giving problems switching channels and you can see what a giant step backwards i took  if i could give this zero stars i would.
this little gizmo works as promised its great if you want to transfer shows from one tv to another in your house you can also download programs to your laptop providing you have tivo to go plus ill never get stuck with another clunker of a movie on an airplane againit took me a little time to figure out that in the setting up stage of connecting your adapter you werent supposed to enter the routers password but rather the complicated encryption key.
easy installation tivo has a rating of reception and i couldnt get it to go more than  but it still works.
this wireless adapter is the only one that worked right for my tivo i had bought one at radio shack of a different brand and it did not work at all but the tivo adapter was easy to plug in and set up i have been able to watch online movies through netflix and now i dont need to plug in the ethernet cord to the modemrouter.
plugged it in and my series  dt popped up a config screen entered my wpa password and i was good to go simple set and good range.
not too much to say about this adapter it does what its supposed to sure an n adapter would be better but even the g is over priced.
easy to setup without having to read the manual haha and works great without having to worry about compatibility problems.
short and sweet had it working flawlessly for  weeks now no problems at all.
i paid less and got the exact same tivo wireless adapter as sold by tivo i have had no problems and now i get updates and download shows to my computer without any cables.
ordered on same day as tivo but came    days later caused a delay in hooking up it would helpful to ensure shipping at the same time especially when one unit is dependant on the other unit dropped off line after the first installation and had to be rebooted seems to be ok nowthis is my first tivo and adapter so i have nothing to compare this product with.
i had purchased another wireless network adapter that wouldnt work for my dvr approx  yrs old now this tivo adapter connected and works great saved a lot of cash too by purchasing through amazon instead of tivo directly.
i have  tivos in the house and each uses a different type of wifi adaptor i bought the tivo ag to connect my series  to my linksys router in  to replace a linksys adaptor to get better speed never got the faster speed but it worked fine for   years and died suddenly i giving two stars because it did not last very long the other wifi adaptors linksys and microsoft are still working and they are older i do want to note that the tivo wifi adaptor runs hot while the others are not even warm.
we unpacked this small module plugged it into the tivo followed the onscreen instructions and we were set up within  minutes we cancelled our landline telephone service not considering that our tivo subscription required dialup access we ordered this product right away and it arrived within  days and was simple to set up so far no problems.
i like this story the most of hardys works an interesting tale with some good realistic characters i think ill read it again.
at first i was a little confused as to how hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novelespecially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first  pages but the story is more than the blurb on the back cover it is about betrayal last wishes the evils of drink and how one mistake can affect you  years down the road hardys fatalistic view seen through henchard is at times enough to drive the reader crazylike many of the other reviewers here i cried throughout the book there are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul and then crash it into the depths of depression this book is not an easy read though there are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finishi liked this book slightly less than i liked tess but it was tess that made me buy this book enjoy.
there is already a book very similar to this one about a dogs adventure in paris findley took creditwith the true authors approval however for this book that john demires actually entirely wrote the book was indeed entertaining and it gave a good overview of many of new orleans novel attractions.
this book asks some hard questions in the way it scrutinizes the bible reverend teel then answers the questions in a way that makes sense and gives a real understanding of the possibilities the book asks the reader to set aside all preconceived notions on religion jesus and god and take a look at it in a most unique way i went into the book on the defensive as a fundamentalist christian and found myself following the argument of reverend teel and even at moments agreeing with him while i certainly dont agree with all of the points he brings out he does bring up some really good questions and gives some really provocative and thought provoking answers he asks the reader only to keep an open mind and in the end i was moved by the book im recommending it to all of my friends.
total waste of celluloid not to mention time money etc not entertaining at all not creative at all not artistic in the least absolutely nothing happens in this ill attempt at making something provocative the viewer gets to accompany someone who resembles cobain for an uneventful boring walk in the woods and a mission to avoid any contact with anyone else the only thing that kept me from ejecting the dvd was my faith in ole gus i kept saying to myself this cant be all there is to this film i kept waiting until even all the credits had rolled as if there would be some surprise or explanation for wasting all that film snorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre.
i have to say that i am a pretty big kurt fan i was excited when this movie came out because i felt it might actually be pretty good the only good thing i can say about this movie was that the actor looked semilike kurt and thats it it was a def bummer and i had to pull myself through it i really cant understand why we cant just leave him alone hes a great artist with a great band the legend should be left to rest in peace kurts probably turning in his grave over this if you have ever read anything about him you would know this is not what he would have wanted all in all take my word for it this is a waste of money and time.
absolute worst movie that i have ever seen i never write movie reviews but this was so bad and hopelessly boring that i felt obligated to say somethingheres the movie guy stumbles around his house mumbling to himself in a dress with a shotguntreated to a full boyzmen video on a tvguy stumbles around and sits in a greenhouse mumble mumblesilence and camera focused on a bush for  minsguys drunk friends come to his house guy plays a song  guys kiss and lay on eachother in bedguy makes mac and cheeseguy dies in his greenhouseawesome moviemakes me want to watch dude wheres my car.
unfortunately this is supposed to be inspiration for the last days of kurt cobains life leave it to this jackass who sold out to everything kurt cobain wasnt let alone this story was told from someone whom never met the man merely this movie was from someone who watched the doors too many times what a waste another person selling out to the all mighty dollar trying to make his film career id recommend buying any album from nirvana if you want to know the true singer in the shadows.
i caught this movie a while ago while it was playing still playing at the theater i was very saddened by how dissapointing it turned out to be im sorry michael pitt is the wrong choice to play kurt cobain even if this is just inspired after the famous late musician the trouble is i dont think anyone could really play kurt i suppose there are people in this movie kim gordan of sonic youth and the director gus van sant who actually knew kurt while he was alive so they know something i dont obviously regardless of the miscasting in my opinion the film is terribly slow and ultimately kind of pointless we already know how its going to end like with elephant but the same director asks that he keep our attention spans going till the end to satisfy his obsession with these real life tragic outcomes i admire van sants lofty goal to create a piece of cinema to attribute to my hero kurt but it just falls short in the end.
this story is one of the most difficult stories i have read thus far i am supposed to summarize the story for an english majors cours.
i just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class and i am sure that i will never voluntarily read faulkner ever again throughout the novel there is no use of punctaution such as an apostrophe and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page the first hundred pages require more attention than a tale of two cities and the narration gets worse from there its as if faulkner didnt want to appeal to or reach any person and to make matters worse there are no book notes anywhere save essays that can help understand it and so dont read this voluntarily but if you have to good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for intruder in the dust.
the back cover states thoroughly updated for its fourth edition not true the only difference between this and the rd edition is that the three clinical problem sets at the back of the rd edition pages  have been replaced by a set of additional questions called the maintenance of certification primer pages  in the first  pages there may be a few questions that have changed between the  editions but i havent found one yet  even chapter  the pictorial atlas is unchanged and i suspect the same will be true for the  online practice exams bottom line  buy the rd edition used for about  and save yourself  still this book is ok for fp boards as is swansons.
elaine and peter are career authors they obviously dont use the products they write about and this book is no exception it is lacking in common sense good advice and practical tips and techniques this series tends to be quite good overall but the authors obvious unfamiliarity with the product they are writing about shines through vividlyif that werent bad enough many of the examples are poor quality and look bitmapped in a vector book shame.
not as good as celtic woman or hanley westenra  i would say not half good i can say they have great talent but artistically  wrong managed stopped watching after  min.
these women rock this is a wonderful performance by  very talented string musicians it is impossible to watch this video and not start dancing or at the least tapping your feet i enjoy watching it while im cookingreally gets me in a festive mood highly recommend it if you enjoy uptempo contemporary music.
as musicians bond really stands out even on this dvd but as showwomen they need a lot of work haylie quickly became annoying as the spotlight hog and as a group they didnt do much in the way of actual entertaining they simpy played their music it may possible that it was planned that wayconsider the british audiencebut if that was the case they should have recorded some other performance for release on dvd in short if you are a fan of bond you will want this but dont expect too much from it.
this product is good for uk only to play in usa you need to find a dvd player which has capability for changing region code to uk and that you may be able to do it on computer but not on dvd player in usa i order it in usa prodact came from uk and i couldnt play it on my most advanced dvd player.
i am now a devoted jean warren fan  math is great for the under  set i have two children  and  and they both have gained so much from the easy activities in this book.
helmut rilling does well with large scale works of bach which is a plus on the b minor mass everything is well articulated with solid bass lines often lacking in authentic performances he captures the faith aspect very well his crucifixus is the best i have heard in capturing the pain of the cross followed by the brilliant contrast of et resurrexit he has an excellent cast of soloists it flows well but has a very slight feel of heavyfootedness it has none of the dance quality so prominent in the mauersberger recording rudolf mauersberger one of few who can bring out both dance and devotion overall most people who are not too much into historically informed would find this quite satisfying.
i order the water shoes and was very pleased with my purchase it is excatly what i wanted and i got it in no time flat i was a little hesitant about ordering on line but this experience was well worth it.
fivestar rating for the quality of the product but they run small i ordered a large and it was just too small for me i wear  pants comfortably although i measure  around my waist at its thickest point my thigh is  at its thickest point and i measure  around my butt.
i have lots of these  using them almost daily as underware  my first pair having purchased at least  years ago my two most recent purchases of these has yielded a variety of quality and sizes  seems like they are being made in multiple overseas sweet shops with little quality control  wont be buying again.
i have no idea how good or bad this item is amazon advertised size m for this item and i ordered it when it came it was s and i didnt know it until after my grandson brought it back saying it was the wrong size when i looked it was a s i had thrown all the papers away so i am stuck with a size small for the next yard sale i have or someone has.
no complaints for wicking abilities and chafing prevention just make sure you pull down the cuffs before you start running otherwise your area may be irritated by the bunching of this and your underwear once you remember to do that youre set.
this product obviously works well for most but it made my twins extremely fussy gassy and spit up like crazy not only did i hate to see them screaming with discomfort but it was the hardest day ive had yet as a new mom to twins yes i said day i took mmp as directed for only one day the babies fussed all day and night leaving me no time to pump to even see if there was an increase in supply i cut out the mmp and went back to plain fenugreek the next day and everyone is happy again im pretty sure its the blessed thistle that caused the issues i tried previously adding blessed thistle capsules to my supplementation routine and we had similar issues although not anywhere near the degree as with mmp i hate leaving a negative review for a product so widely loved and touted but i didnt find anything about effects similar to my experience so i felt the need to share.
there are several altered versions of thayers classic poem in existancethis book uses one of themi love this poem and i wish the author had stuck with the originalespecially when ernest lawrence thayer is listed as the authoralso the images of casey and the spectators are of modernday participants casey is wearing a helmet and his name andnumber are on the back of his uniform not like a playerin  at allleroy neiman is a great artist and that is the only reason i give this stars.
not one of the stronger entries in the series slaves of obsession suffers from too many set pieces and not enough of the emotional complexity usually found in this series far too much time is spent on the philosophical battle between union and confederate issue.
i loved the cover when i saw it and i was very excited to receive it i like this artists music but was not too thrilled with this cd it was not what i thought it would be and very jungle like.
this piece is ultimate steinbeck the author has limited his characters to two major ones and a few ancillary ones the book is short however the tale is told thoroughly the reader feels so very sorry for george george is a study of loyalty decency and patience and how one feels so utterly responsible for the life of another human beingin this case his childhood friend lennie who is somewhat mentally challenged this book is a sad account of the fragility of human beings and how one person will be loyal to the other person til the endeven if he needs to commit murder to show it the character candy is so very pathetic too and his comments about  a stranger killing my old dog are so very sad one tends to think that it was because of candy feeling badly about a stranger killing his dog that george does what he does this is a beautiful book.
i found several critical problems with this play including narrative structure plot thematics metaphorical irony and satirical narcissism serious scholars need not apply the books are not for the people to do with lenny and carl shooting the tragedy in the end is an unfortunate incident for the lives of everyone on the earthen structures if youre good looking for steinbeck i suggest the rapes of wrath.
i thought that of mice and men was a pretty good book it told a story of a relationship between two friends if you dont like cussing in a book then this is not the one to read otherwise it was really good.
short but marvelous thats of mice and men in three words but that nutshell does extreme injustice to the true wonder of this classicthrough this tale john steinbeck was able to say so much in so little words never before have i seen so many themes bonded so seemlessly together without being boring and flat no of mice and men was enjoyable and i would never mind reading it again i will never forget of mice and men for it has found its own special place in my heart and forever there it will remain.
of mice and men by john steinbeck was the best book i have ever read the characters the mentally retarded lennie and the tough george are on the run from people from weed lennie was accused of trying to rape a girl in a red dress when he actually wanted to touch it since it was so soft after that they find a ranch in salinas california to work on for a while there are conflicts and solutions all at the same timemy favorite character was lennie because even though he was really mentally retarded he was kind and did nothing out of harm he knew that george loved him by giving tough love while on the ranch all he thought about was the rabbits i get to tend the rabbits was my all time favorite quote because he always said it to remind himself what he was going to do when they got off the farm sometimes i always thought he was rather hopeful even when he was sad.
of mice and men was a great book it told about how and little man named george who was smart and a dumb man lennie who was really big and strong this book explained how the one man helps out another guy that isnt smart at all and just needs taking caring of because his aunt clara died well while they both keep working on the fields bucking barley they come up with an idea to own a house and a couple of acres well lennie loves to rub soft things so he wants to just get the house and tend the rabbits the book is just a good book of how good of friends can work together and when something goes wrong a friend has to do the thing that is best for the other.
i was in th grade when i read this book for the first time and i was very impressed in my opinion this book is one of the finest books ever written by an american authorsteinbeck it takes place in the early s where  friends find a job helping out on a farm they meet several interesting people there and run in to some problems throughout this movie they are in search of what they refer to as the fat of the land or the american dream all around this was a great book and i highly recomend it to anyone who hasnt yet read it.
of mice an men is a great novel it sends you back in time to the great depression era of the s it is a good book for middle school students the reason i gave this book four stars is because of the profane languange used in the book except for the language this book is a great book to read.
by far one of the best books ever written i felt as if i was in the book taking part of the adventure john steinbeck has made it clear that he is among the elite writers in the margin between william shakespeare and edgar allan poethe feeling you get is indescribable when you read this book the story of when george and lennie will have their own land and lennie could finally raise rabbits  just gives you your own sense of libertyplease if you are sensitive andor depressed be aware this book is great but very depressing.
of mice and menin this story there are two very good friends george and lennie they are on a journey for a better life lennie is mentally ill so george teaches him right from wrong on the way they are leaving a little town and going to another town in search of a better job several of lennies habits get then fired from their last job so they hope that they will have better luck in the next one lennie makes quite a few mistakes but no matter what george manages to over look them until lennie makes a very big mistake which leads to a shocking ending.
when i started reading the book at school i found it boring i had to read it for school if i didnt read it i would had a  and almost all the class found it boring its funny when leenie principal characters who does stupid thing george says in one part to the owner of the ranch im not saying hes bright he aint but hes as strong as a bull but the theme doesnt make it a pleasure to read the book is easy to understand and doesnt have difficult words the story is about to people george and leenie who are itinerant workers who go to one place to another to find job they have a dream but its very difficult for them to make it true because of leenies dumbness when theyre working in ranch problems happens because of leenie the entire story is about that subject to finish my review ill tell you not to spend your time reading this book when there are better books unless you have to read it for school i could only recommended to steinbecks fans.
my youngest daughter is an avid reader and loves rereading books she was assigned in english class in fact she is a collector of these required assigned readings such as of mice and men.
the story oif mice and men is a good book because there is never really a dull moment i expected the book to be about mice i later found out it was really about this book was about two lowlife farmers who are trying to get their own stake george is the brighter one who is in charge of the operation so the book takes place in a rural area in california i t is a fiction book its a rally good book so you should check it out.
a classic as always in the today world of teaching tolerance and differences this remains a good one to use in the classroom.
this book is short but man it packs a touching message i had to read it for a class and analyze everything about it and it really is a touching story if you put everything together the ending completely surprised me and i can see why george decided to do that it left me crying for both george and lennie for everything they had been through i will never forget this book and will continue reading it throughout the years lennie may have been dumb but he was still smart in his own special ways.
this book has been great it brings a lot of emotions and its cool to see different types of people caring for each other and having a real great friendship until the end.
my english teacher read this book outloud to us it was the worst thing ever i feel asleep every day he read it because it was so boring it seemed like it took forever to finish so dont read this book unless you want somthing really really boring.
of mice and men by john steinback is a great book to readit is a book about how george a small quick guy helps lennie a big guy who is not very smartthrough the story george always helps lenniethis book makes you want to keep on reading to find out what happensmy favorite part about of mice and men is that it has a sad endingits not one of those boring storys where it has a happy endindthis book is more unique.
using just a few of the principles found in this book is helping me turn my sites into cash generators instead of just static sites hoping someone will stop by thanks declan for providing information that truly helps the average everyday person become successful in this awesome frontier called the internet.
i saw this in a little theatre in manhattan hoping for a more polished morrisseyrich experience but this was a pretty subpar affair and frankly its annoying to see a film this poor with even decent distribution terrible camerawork and spotty acting overall bad editing and annoying cali poppunk soundtrack only saved by the presence of quasi i was really disappointed when people put such little effort and inspiration into something and they get support one less person with a real vision gets heard it was occasionally worth a laugh but overall i found myself angry at the gods for opening up the pandoras box of indie films without keeping the hacks out we have enough of those in hollywood.
the funniest parts of this book are the ones used to get you to buy it the rest was lame i found myself yawning the only good thing about this book is how small it is the boredom ends in a couple of hours.
i bought this book when my twins were  months old and i wanted some guidance on daytime napping and a lot of friends had recommended healthy sleep habits i didnt mean to buy your fussy baby since mine are too old for that so be careful when you buy this package that you get both books i had already read a lot of books on sleep training and while there were some really good tips here i found the contented little baby book by gina ford more direct weissbluth allows for more discretion which i think a mother needs and overall i think this is a very good book to be read in conjunction with other philosophies and you can adapt what works for your style and babies a mustread if your baby doesnt sleep very much and you think it is ok that way its not.
as an avid movie goer this just about changed me to a non movie goer the lesson i learned was to pay a little attention before dropping your money into a maybe it might be good because adam sandler is in it movie boy was i wrong this is not even worth renting badbadstupidpoor writing actingfilming  generally it sucked.
the first time i saw this movie in the theater i remember liking it but being so sad at the end nevertheless as i love drew and adam i bought it on dvd when it came out i couldnt believe how much i laughed now that i knew the ending it wasnt so sad that i missed the rest of the movie there are so many clever scenes in this movie that i think people forget if they just watch it once when drew attacks rob schneider with a bat when adam jokes with his walrus and penguin when adam apologizes to drew for not being better looking i can go on and onthis is the movie my husband and i put on when we want to laugh and cuddle on the couch on friday night its perfect.
i do love adam sandler and i thought him and drew made a great pair in the wedding singer so i just had to watch this i was not disappointed it is refreshing to watch a movie where both fun things occur as well as there are wellwritten punch lineshenry sees lucy as a challenge being it she has lost her memory and he makes it his everyday job to make her fall for him sooner or later hes bound to fall for her too the real challenge is for him to come up with new methods to make her rememberit turns out to be a charming romantic and very touching movie one of the best movies in this genre to come out in .
at the core of the movie is an affecting concept a man who falls in love with a woman who cant remember him the following morning so each day he has to make her fall in love with him all over again its a touching situation and the two coleads play this aspect of the movie with delicacy and charm however this wasnt enough for the marketing  development people so they added a ton of crude slapstick and a lot of stale and offensive sexual humor this robs the movie of any chance it might have had to touch the viewers heart and left me wondering how the movie ever made it out of the cutting room the earlier movie in which these two coleads appeared the wedding singer was fortunate enough not to suffer from these drawbacks  first dates is a movie worth missing.
 could be cut and reedited in arbitrary sequences and nobody would notice sandler is the apotheosis of the onetrick pony the actor who is always exactly the same character in every film in short he doesnt act at al.
i wont bore you with the plot of the movie as i assume you have an idea what its about if youve come this far i found the film stood up quite well as a romantic comedy it was both delightfully funny and a bit sad at times just like life i am surprised that some of the reviewers have taken the film so seriously and are disturbed by how the critical events are portrayed its just a film and its meant to entertain it did a great job of that with the terrific onscreen chemistry of sandler although i cant stand him in most other films and barrymore.
the idea behind this film is that in a successful relationship you have to fall in love over and over again in this story it happens literally everydaythe performancesadam sandler as henry roth shows his vulnerable side in his best and most natural performancedrew barrymore as lucy whitmore has never been better and has great chemistry with adam she emerges as a fine actorrob schneider as ula may fool you that he is really the character he is playing i didnt know it was him for half the move he is brilliantly funnysean astin as doug whitmore better known as sam from the lord of the rings is funny in this comic role as lucys lisping brotherpomaikai brown as nick tattoo face the cook is great in his small role and deserves bigger roles in the futureshot in hawaii it has beautiful cinematography and vibrant color the movie is a combination of humor and romance with more heart than you might expect.
this did not have a fruity smell at all and had to be thrown out because it is definatley not something i would ever wear again.
both passport dvds ive had the misfortune of viewing this one  plan  from outer space have a large pip logo on screen for the entire movie which is extremely distracting  unneccesary for quality get the roan edition.
i really like this cooker somewhat different than expected but after using it i am sold nice size.
it appears that except indologist everybody else know how to read mtdna findings nowhere in the book i could read the recent breakthrough about the lack of genetic evidence on aryan invasion and migration and after concluding that indus valley had the evidence of fire place shiva and shakti seals and so on she then again go back to the imaginary of how european white aryan descended to the black dravidian world of indus valley if that is how westerner try to write history of other cultures i myself being a westerner feel very sorry for my own people the bottom line is this do not try to defend something that is indefensible please start writing all the facts in details and tell us cleary what happened to the indus valley culture did it disappear or continued as the vedic culture.
i first started listening to azucar moreno through a friend in new york a long time ago this is exciting music and you dont have to understand spanish to get into the party feeling of this music flamenco latin pop whatever you want to call it every album seems to have one standout pop booty shaker i think tequila claims this title but besame is cool and tu eres para mi is funky cool and hay que matar a la muerte pops with energy.
 its become my favorite video joan blondell and carole landisthe poor mans betty grableare great as the two party gals who go to a spooky old mansion to claim the inheritance that landis has been awarded billy burke as mrs topper is a scream and so is her sidekick maid patsy kelly no one could do a doubletake better than patsy and rochester as cosmo toppers man servant is hysterical the beautiful camerawork the womens gowns the topnotch special effects and the hysterical sightgags ranks this with the best of abbott and costello comedies a terrific excuse to while away an hour and a half when youre feeling down or bored best scene the playful seal and rochester.
i like baby dolls but not this one i love phoebe and roxxi so maybe i would get the big baby versions of those but no other big bratz babyz this doll is not soft so so much for hugging and cuddling it its kind of cute but i would get big baby phoebe and roxxi onlyas for your false lies about barbie people are still buying them mattel has not given up and barbie will still be aroundfor years to come i love both barbie and bratz and nothing willchange that.
vanessa carltons release of her second album shows how talented she really is her touch of piano to the tracks make the album what it is original and breath takingwhite house whos to say afterglow private radio half a week before the winter and she floats stand out from the rest of the album each one reveals vanessas look on life from the past present and future they also show how she see the world and what she wishes it could bethe rest of harmonium contain tracks that are amazing as well for they tell stories which are ear catching this album is not what i expected it to be after hearing her debut on.
this is by far a better cd than vanessas first all i have to say is that this is one of the best albums that i have ever listened to whos to say has become one of my favorite songs san francisco is also an amazing song vanessa really shows what a great artist she is in this album.
harmonium is such an incredible record and it completely exceeds my initial expectations for vanessa carltons sophomore album it is a little different from s be not nobody in the sense that we are allowed to take a deeper look into vanessas beautiful and sometimes dark soul i would have to say that most of the treasures on this record are the more upbeat songs some of these songs that steal the show are the bittersweet white houses a summer song about friendship love and loss and whos to say a song about choosing between family and a relationhip also though a little dark annie shines on harmonium if you are not already a nessaholic you will be once you hear this talented ivory tickler show off her gift harmonium is in stores now so go out and pick it up now.
my daughter uses the headband as a toy and as a hair piece a must for any naruto fan to add to their collection.
fits great looks great had no problems with it at all i would recommend anyone buying this for crossplay its ligit.
this item doesnt even look like the one the picture its not the real thing and its a bootleg one.
i expected a work on stalking to be very dry and difficult to get through this bookhowever was extremely interestinginformative and easy to read it is the sort of book that the normal man in the street could read and apply as easily as someone who is more knowledgeable about the subject a wonderful handbook for anyone having troubles of this nature and a wothwhile read for any safety conscious individual.
i dont agree that clay shows no emotion one needs only to listen to the way measure of a man run to me  or music from the ai season  solitaire here there and every where to hear plenty of emotion and inflection lets not forget silver bells and give a little love this chrismas forgive me if i got the title wrong hopefully some of you have had a chance to listen to some of his demo music with many spiritual songs and one song that brought me to tears i will be there not only can this artist belt it out  he can also whisper softly and pull you right into the song but i digress as for my review of this cd the problem is not the singer or the voice of the singer but the weakness of the songs and their production hopefully they will take more time with clays next cd and bring music to the table that matches his talent i recommend the cd on the strength of clays voice and the way it makes you feel even the weaker songs.
listened to the cd three times and love it catchy tunes i caught myself humming throughout the day love ballads that i so moving great mix of songs it sure beats listening to some of the hard core music we have on the radio today a few tunes were almost beatles sounding clean and refreshing clay should just stay the way he is and his style should be left untarnished by the whoever tries to change it anyone who wants an enjoyble cd that they can understand and feel good while listening to it should buy this cd the cd just makes you feel good clay sounds great.
i cannot describe the wonderful voice of this young man its so awesome he takes my breath away i recommend this cd to everyone he shows such emotion and love with each note he sings thank you clay aiken for this magnificent cd and i so look forward to your tour and your next cd.
i wonder why amazon will not post my review of this album i loved clay on american idol  but he lost get over it this album is average at best stop pushing him as though he won reuben is the winner and clays measure of a man does not measure up to reubens soulful.
dont get me wrong clay can really sing his voice is good enough but his music is just so corny and boring all ballads and wanna be broadway sounding songs i cant even bear to listen i only do it to figure out what all the furor is about i still havent save yourself the effort.
in the new edition of websters they should stick a photo of this to define schmalz oh my god is this what our music culture has devolved to this album was inflicted on me as i was in borders the other day i left without buying anything which is unusual for me by the way cats are wonderful creatures.
out of all the songs on this album there were only twosongs that ididnt thing were appropriate for his voice some of the songs he got to do what he does best and that was to hit the high notes very well done was happy to see it at amazon and bought it immediately hopefully his next album will be just as good.
it is obvious that clay aiken has talent there is no fooling about that he is definitely one of the most talented pop stars out there right now however the people producing this album did a poor job showcasing the talent that clay aiken holds every song on this album sounds the same the emotions portrayed by clay are not very divers.
i am highly entertained not by this horrible music but by the marketing scam perpetrated on the music buying public over and over tell them its good a thousnad times and they will buy anything it is an admirable thing to see clive davis become even more wealthy by pumping out more and more drivel for the masses to consume a good clue to the quality of the five star reviews for this release can be found by the list of music purchases made by those who bought this cd cds from the american idol series closer  josh groban the movie album  barbra streisand bette midler sings the rosemary clooney songbook  bette midler one heart  celine dion the very best of cher  cher buddy jewell  buddy jewell michael buble enhanced  michael bubleif lack of taste were a crime all involved with this release would be in jail.
i love this manand please dont get me started on his voicei now cant ever imagine my life without having clay aiken in it hes such a wonderful talentnot only with his beautiful haunting vibrato but his whole personahe is the next elvis i cant wait to hear many more albums to come believe me im a picky person when it comes to music i choseand i chose claymeasure of a man gets an a thumbs up and a million stars.
first i am a huge fan of clay aiken he has a magnificent voice that i feel the powers that be tried to turn into just another pop singer im not saying the songs are bad im just saying some of them werent easily recognized as clays voice i would have loved more ballads with the backgrounds a little quieter so clay could shine through lets hope the next album has more of clay less pop attitude.
dont get me wrong clay is a wonderful vocalist really truely he is a gifted singer but the big problem these days is that there are so many gifted singers who end up with horrible stale and downright creepy material has anyone actually listened to the lyrics to invisible it sounds more like a stalker than a lonely everyman and its way creepy his other songs all sound the same and in some cases are laughably silly i feel so let down i wanted so much to love this album because i love clay but its just bad hopefully next time around clay gets himself more worthy material because if he continues down this path he will end up forgotten please better material.
ok people i like pop music i do i like good produced pop music even if artist is commercial this cd is no different than pink or britney cds as mr clay is claiming to be different that is he said people are tired of fake pop stars well to tell you the truth he is no different it is marketing machine that is trying to tell people how he is so like you ordinary and all nice so you could buy his cd well that dont matter too much to me if the music is good but this cd aint nothing special ordinary power ballads with cheap lyrics i also have message for clay kid good job with stories about how youre so different than justin and pink american public eats them for lunch and please now that you have money get someone else to write you album because this one sucks.
this album is a major disappointment because clay aiken has so much promise as an entertainer his charisma and talent so evident on american idol are noticeably missing on this album of mediocre songs the title alone was a bad choice  kevin sharp also released a measure of a man in the s and was much more deserving to use it since he was battling cancer at the time of its recording and this collection of forgettable tracks wont give clay the staying power he will need to stay afloat in the cutthroat entertainment world please american idol  you got them through the door but that means nothing if they cant stay there bad album from a bright talent.
the clive davis churned out anothere same ol same ollike what david foster did to josh grobangreat voices with little to do the singer can be great but if the material is mostly wrongoh welli will hope for better next time.
these recordings deeply affected me even more so than the works of the johnny mathis.
i would expect no less than great singing and clay doesnt disappoint his voice is just gorgeous his singing delivery and the cds production are all terrificmy one complaint has more to do with music today than with clay cant anyone write a good uptempo melody these days some of these songs are just boring but then again i find that to be the case with most of whats on the radio nowadays everything is either slow and boring or fast and insipid my favorite clay moments from american idol were when he sang faster songs  billy joel grease buttercup  so i know he can definitely sing uptempo songs i just hope he does on the next album.
clay aikens new cd is wonderful better than i had expecited his voice lifts my spirits up i am a die heart elvis fan just wating for some one to like as much i think i have found him.
when i first listened to the way i loved it instantly its the kind of song you can sing along with hearing it for the first time it is very catchy and very romantic i think this should be his next single their will be some that dont like it because its not edgy enough who cares im sick of the negative reviews if they want to have edge and profanity in their music there are plenty of other artists out there to choose from sorry for going off there anyway i love the way and i also really really like touch overall i love the entire cd i am going to play it until i memorize every word.
im sorry for everyone out there who actually spent their money on clays cd im amazed that clay even made it to the top ten on american idol i think that the only people that voted for him were people that thought he was cute personally i think he is a disgrace to the north carolina name in conclusion the only reason i give this cd one star is because you cant give a cd zero stars if i could give it zero stars i would.
ugh from the fake smile on his cd single to the barry manilowish album cover this guy screams superficiality sorry clayyou might have been second in american idol iibut you are not barry manilow i just have a problem with someone who has to use a tv show to get noticed instead of using their godgiven talents and merits to get to superstardom it smacks in the face of those who have real talent and are struggling to be heard and appreciated by the music industry and the public so many good singers are passed up because of tripe like this please spend your money wisely and dont buy this cd go out and get yourself ultimate barry manilow or even a good celine dion disc instead at least those folks worked for years to get where they areand obviously have some talent clay i wish you luckbut i am sure your career will be history in about a year.
dont listen to that negative uncalledfor review by ffaulkner ff he doesnt know what he is talking about he just came to stir up trouble because he is jealous rude and ignorant let me clean up this board clay aikens voice is outstanding and is like no other measure of a man cd is exciting and is the best debut cd by a male musical artist in the past  years clay aiken is americas idol because of his irresistable voice and character and his many many fans please buy this cd you will not be disappointed at all the songs are very good.
this is the real american idol clays fantastic voice is showcased fabulously on almost all of these tracks a must have for all american idol fans but this cd is appealing to everyone  of these songs are great i wish solitaire would have been included but it will be on his next single finally a singer with talent.
clay aikens debut i wasnt sure what to think i tried to stay away from american idol records but when i heard invisible on the radio my resolve melted and i purchased the cd and im very glad i did clay has a beautifulpowerful voice unlike some artists out there hes truly talented he puts his heart and soul into each and every song there isnt one song on this that i hateonce he draws you in you wont let go no offense to ruben fans but i believe clay shouldve won the contesti couldnt recommend this cd any higher i believe clay will be around for a long time to come .
this if for the music fan from washington stateif anyone has poopy for brains it is youmy mother always said if you cant say something niceabout somebody dont say anything at allclay has a great voice and a wonderful cd and is a nicerespectul person  you should take some lessons from him.
clay is a true talent and i am sure he will grow  mature into a great singer but this cd is full of pop fluff there are no show stopping numbers to be found here clay is not a pop star he should be in a westend or broadway show delivering show stopping number after number and as one reviewer said that even solitaire wasnt included which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent as for the american idol creators were slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion and even clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is invisible.
i fell in love with clays voice when he sang open arms on american idol it was so touching and i never understood whynone of my friends liked him they liked ruben instead nobody thought clay would ever make it far and look at him now he has the best voice and his cd is awesome i highly reccomend the songs invisible the way when you say you love me and this is the night i especially like when you say you love me because clay is not as good at uptempo songs but he nailed this one i program my cd player to play this song over and over all of the songs on this cd are awesome and i know youll love it.
excellent voice excellent lyrics excellent music this cd has is all every track on this cd shows clay aikens pure and natural talent this cd has not been out of my cd player since its release date oct  i listen to it everyday finally with all the gimmacks that other pop artists try to pass off as talent there is a young man that has talent a gift to us all a truly beautiful voice clay fills the void of what is missing in todays music a real singer and he does it so wellits a shame that i could only give it  stars because its so much better than that clay is a keeper with the talent to be around for a long time.
i havent liked much recent american pop but clay sure is a good singer i watched him perform invisible on the billboard awards i was completely blown away simply amazing a friend had also sent me his this is the nightbridge over troubled water single earlier this year amazing as well good work clay hope your future albums are excellent as well.
clay aiken does it again from the first time i heard clay sing i was a fan i voted for him when he was on american idol a lot more then once let me tell you and now i am even obsessed with him i was so excited when clays album came out i love each song on the album and listen to every one evey day almost there have been a lot of bad reviews and i am not going to get mad because that is their own oppinion but i really dont know what they are talking about maybe they are listening to a different cd or something because this album is amazing his voice could have been showed off more but on a couple of songs it really is showed off like in perfect day i think a lot of people would love this cd.
this man really does have a great voice dont get me wrong but i dont think this is an album that people should waste there money onyes i am a fan of josh groban but this is not what the deal is about i just think that this cd has some crappy songs with crappy lyrics i mean invisible is about clay wanting to watch me in my room that kind of freaks me out i dont want some guy on my wall watching me ge undressedclay got on american idol to become the famous person that he is if it wasnt for that show then he would still be a nobody teacher he has a normal voice nothing that someone in a church choir doesnt havei think that if you are going to blow your money on real music then you should buy josh groban yea he does sing in different languages but if you translate them they have great meanings and you can even get addicted to italian at least josh can speak another language heh.
this album is a complete waste of clays voice all i can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad air supply meets bad barry manilow i cant understand what motivates these outstanding reviews for a album thats not worthy of them these songs are about exciting as muzak except if clays music was playing in elevators i would be forced to take the stairs i hope by the next release clay has the music to complement his voice.
being a year old male i am probably not the typical clay aiken fan as with many the first time i heard the album i was disappointedvery disappointed after i listened to it a couple more times it started to grow on me now i think its actually very well done and clays vocals on the album are absolutely incrediblefor those who were unimpressed with the album i encourage you to listen to it againmaybe even twice if you still dont like it fine  shelf itbut i think youll find it will grow on youit seems a lot of people had a similar experiencethe more they listened the more they liked it i have also noticed that reviews written within the first few days after the release have been much more negative than those written a week or two latersolisten to it again.
it hurts to see clay fall like this the momentum leading up to the cd release was so great that it only leads to disappointment its not clays fault i blame it on the media and hype surrounding the release that clay could not do anything but failplease do not waste your hardearned money on this trash josh grobins cd is much more satisfying.
while i wanted to love this cd  i think clay is the greatest example of the american can do philosophy and a decent human being to boot  i was disappointed when i first listened other than this is the night the only track to wow me was i survived you but since i wanted to love it and i had paid good money for the thing i kept listening  then i fell  and i mean hard  i do love this cd  no it is not the greatest musical production ever in fact i think it is overproduced  clays voice sings for itself  it needs less help not more.
clay has made many of us get back into the album buying mode i think this new release is great in every aspect i too would like to see neil sedaka produce him that aside the critics who tell us we cant like him are pushing us right into his arms.
i am very surprised at the  starspeople are giving this cd pleasedont waste your money clay wasokay on ai but this new cd justshowcase his talents hopefullynext one will be better i will haveto give this one two thumbs down.
cant hide my disappointment with this cd i was looking forward to it especially after attending the idol concert in raleigh unfortunately on this cd clay is overpowered by background singers there is also no diversity most of the songs sound the same to me as an older fan i was hoping for some classic numbers like those clay sang on the tv series i wont be listening to this cd again hopefully whoever is responsible for it will learn from the experience and can produce something which will let clay shine and reach out to his entire audience on his next cd.
that a bad star for clay aiken this cd is really borring and all the songs sound the same one listen of this album is enought to say dont waste your money into this cd really peace of nothing.
this cd is a huge disappointment clay has such an awesome voice and this cd does little to show off his true talent the songs are average at best and lack the kind of melodies that would truly show off clays gift ive read many reviews of this cd and the most recent stated the same it lacks any luster and will probably get lost in a pile of old cds good luck next time clay on producing some more appropriate music for your awesome voice.
but i liked him better on american idol im glad that others like it his cd and that hes doing really well on the charts.
i waited in anticipation for the release of this album i think its awful with the exception of two tracks  measure of a man and this is the night the background music is far too loud and drowns out clay most of the time it sounds like he is shouting to be heard above the music the wonderful voice we heard on american idol is certainly not evident on this cd the lack of ballads is disappointing  hes certainly not cut out to be the next rock star  please dont try to portray him as such.
i fell in love with him when he first auditioned on american idol  i was praying for him the whole way through and was disappointed when he lost to ruben but his sales prove that he should have been the american idol i bought his cd the second day it came out i had been waiting for it for so long and i was not disappointed at all he sounds wonderful and it feels as if hes singing only to you if you have a good ear and know good music when you hear it this cd is for you there arent many good singers left so im thankful hes blessed with this gift.
actually i love potato chipsthis just plain sucks what is wrong with you people must you follow and do everything a reality show tells you to do and this guy supposeldy freakin lost theres something wrong here folks when society is reduced this low and forget such classics and beethoven and mozart concertos classic rock like floyd or zepplin even modern music like dream theater and nightwishthere is something wrong with american societyjust like with potato chipsyou dont know when the frell to stop.
im not really into pop music i really like rap and rb but i can really dig a great voice so what can i say clay aiken got a real good voice soul power and range the songs are a bit predictable and not very challenging but the dude aiken racks up all the songs touch is a good song proving that aiken should explore hip hop a little when you say you love me has a country sound to it i do not like country music i didnt like this song either but it got itself on in my head for hours i did like invincible clay can really shake it up he displays his impressive range in run to me and measure of man perfect day and no more sad songs have a rock edge the way and shine and run to me are soulful ballads i liked aikens voice better than the songs hopefully he picks some better song writers next time.
this cd showcases clays talent beautifully he sounds fantastic i think his music will appeal to a wide range of people i am very proud of clay aiken he has stayed true to himself thats refreshing way to go clay.
this is an amazing cd this mans voice is incredable there is not one song that i dislike i loved his performances on american idol but this cd shows more of what he can do all you clay fans are in for something great cant say much more buy it and see for yourself.
clay aikens voice stands out more than any other singer i have listened to it inspires makes you feel good excites and is just nice to listen to i can put his measure of a man cd and listen to every song again again very rare for albums now a days to have every song enjoyable invisible  up tempo po.
i love love love this cd very much clay aikens vocals are perfect and sings so well clay aiken deserves a whole lot more radio airplay.
love it love it love it i have listened to this cd since it came out on clay aiken has a magical voice that pulls you in all the songs are good and the outstanding songs in my opinion are the way touch and when you say you love meit is refreshing for an entertainer to have the morals and committments that clay aiken has i find myself singing along to the musicnot that you want to hear me singing god bless mr aiken in his future endeavors i for one have been thrilled with the music and will continue buying anything mr aikens releases go clay dont let the nasties get you downthere are a lot of fans that just want to hear you sing.
i am extremely proud of you clayyour album is everything i expected and more  i was very impressed with your songs and always with your amazing and beautiful voice god has truly blessed you with a gift and a beautiful soul  i am proud to shout to the world i am a clay aikens fanand he is my american idol keep up your good work in all that you doyou are an amazing person i look forward to all of your albums.
ive honestly heard this entire album im glad that i didnt buy it everything sounds almost the same and i find myself getting bored with his voice im a big fan of everyone on ai so i listen to every song first before i judge i would say kelly clarkson and ruben studdards cds are better than this please do yourself a favor and buy those instead not this i would recommend maybe downloading some of clays songs but dont spend your money.
my thrifty stingy friend whod not even throw away monthold newspapers gave me this cd and told me i could keep it i should have been suspicious of this unexpected generositymy hunch was right on every song sounds the same stale corny and sleepinducing id rather reread monthold newspapersunless i have trouble sleeping then ill whip out the cd and i know ill fall asleep within  songs or faster.
i wasnt sure how i would react to this cd its not the usual style of music i listen to but i love clay aikens voice i was pleasantly surprised this cd rocks my favorite song is shine i cant get it out of my head i also love measure of a man and i survived you yay clay.
after the massive success of clay aikens first single this is the night the expectations were high for his debut album luckily aiken does not disappoint from the catchy uptempo single invisible to the touching and emotive title track measure of a man this cd provides a fantastic balance of lyrical depth and impressive vocal range while some think his powerful voice is better suited for broadway this impeccable debut cd proves that clay has the capability of being a phenomenal recording artist in an industry full of sellouts and talentless clones its refreshing to experience an artist as gifted and genuine as clay aiken.
since the moment i heard clay on american idol  i have loved his voice this album shows just what this youg man can do he can sing the songs are powerful and sung to perfection by clay every song is really great and you will definitely listen to this album over and over i dont see how anyone could not like it its just that good this is one of the greatest if not the grestest pop album of all time clay made a masterpiece.
this cd is one of very few that i own that i listen to the entire cd i enjoy each song on the album and i find myself constantly singing along i highly recommend this cd.
no wonder this man won an american music award a billboard music award and his single and album went platinum and double platinum i bought this cd because i liked invisible because of billboard saying its the best pop cd of  and because i figured he must be good if he won awards i was so glad i bought it after i heard it what a great album its so nice to hear someone with a great voice singing material thats not filled with the nonsense that is on so many cds today this is real music.
i watched each week to hear this beautiful voice on american idol and waited for this cd to be releasedi took it home played it once and it is now in the stack to be traded inhow disappionting maybe i expected too much i do not like the songs sorry.
why would any lucid human being waste their money buying this junk this isnt music this is contrived and manufactured i dont watch american idol and i never would because its a awful tv show that degenarates everything good about music the only people who buy this are clueless teenaged girls who know zilch about music and and middle aged woman who buy this for their kids to torture them way too sappy way too bland this is safe music for people afraid to listen to music that takes risks and challenges them intellectually clay aiken should stop covering songs from the beatles and simon and garfunkel hes destroying those classics with his broadwayesque voice the beatles were actual artists who took risks in music and were innovative clay is nothing like that just another talentless popstar getting his  minutes of fame and then will fade away into oblivion the sooner the better.
im not a hard person to please but this cd makes me want to vomit if you are looking for  songs that sound the same then this is your cd if youre looking for something with a little variety look elsewhere i am a huge fan of clays but was very disappointed with this cd if youve heard one of the songs youve pretty much heard them all.
this style is for broadway the songs are blend he will not last making those type of songs.
clay aiken is the reason i enjoyed the second season of ai so much his voice is so pure and strong its almost like listening to an angel sing it is apparent that he has such a big heart and he puts so much feeling into his songs it doesnt matter what he sings he does an outstanding job i bought his album and i have to say i think its the best first album of any american idol thus far any song he sings that broadcasts his voice range just awes me anybody that doesnt think this young man is talented needs to have their hearing checked he is spectacular in my opinion clay should have won aihands down definitely an album worth owning.
only claymates like it and his fans are buying his way mr aiken has a large internet fan base who are purchasing multiples to boost his sales to make the album appear to be great however they have to beg radio to play it here is a response from a radio stationquote as of right now we have no plans to add invisible to our playlistinterest in the song is strictly limited to fans of clay aikenpeople outside the claymate realm really arent that into the songthe video isnt even getting substantial play on mtv or vhyou may want to try our sister stationthe song has more of an adult contemporary feel to itgood luck end of quotedont believe all the five star reviews of this album if you want true reviews of this album read the  to  star reviews and you will get a fair assessment of what it really is about the other reviews are all hype with no substance.
when i think of clay the first phrase that comes to mind is awwwwwww he is just so cute and for once hes a cutie who can actually sing his voice is tremendous and his songs showcase his voice well i was a faithful idol  viewer and rooted for clay from day  i am delighted to see how much he has grown as an artist ruben who and how he has overpowered all of the other idols in popularity album sales and tv appearancesmy only complaint is the lack of song variety theres a point where all of the songs start to sound the same and the only reason that you keep on listening is because well its clayhes my favorite idol.
people who have appreciated real music for decades finally get to relive the experience through the measure of a man cd the crystal clearness unspoiled beauty perfect pitch and power of clay aikens voice is matched by the feeling he puts into every phrase i am so impressed with this cd and as much as i love each song im blown away by perfect day.
this is an album that i will listen to again and again wonderful songs sung by a great voice touch i will carry you and invisible are my faves pop music at its best.
clay once again suprises mei have listened to this cd thinking how could he be betterhe is clays voice range his use of his god given talent is astounding all the songs are wonderful especially invisible and measure of a man he gets better and better and i hope he has a long wonderful journey ahead i would recommend this cd to everyone what a great addition to every music library.
i dont like this music at all maybe its just me and if you like this then you probably really think its just me but all music sounds the same well most bands not all but its just trash that we listen to and then after a few years you never listen to it i dont know i dont have his cd and im not going to get it you can if you want to but i like things that are original.
this is an awesome albumway to go clay we have waited for months for this album and now that it is here we are all learning the words and singing right along with claycant wait to see him in concert and hear more songs from this amazing young man he thrills all ageswhat an amazing ambassador you haveclay is also our american idol in canada as wellplease come here on your concert tour too.
this is truly the best cd that i have bought in a very long time i followed clay aiken all through ai loved the first single was a little worried about the debut cd i was so blown away by the songs his voice and the fact that his character comes through every song what an incredible way to start a career i am anxiously awating the next cd that he puts out thanks clay you have shown us that singing is still alive.
bought it and was a bit disappointed i thinkthat clay should stick to his own style andstop trying to be someone hes not the songsjust didnt do it for mecertainly not the clay aiken that sold platinumwith his first cd wonder how that happenedspend your money of something worth while butif you just got to have it burn yourself acopy from a clay fanatic who is sure to havea few extras on hand.
i fell in love with clay the first day he auditioned on ai he is not only adorable he as a awesome voice girls are crazy over him and this cd is soo greatits beautiful i love clay soo much and if u say that you cant stand him then why are you wasting time reviewing over himjelousy  keep it up claymates he has already gone double platinum woowoo.
he might start rapping on his next cd and chances are you might hear him ruben and pharrell do a joint together anyway clays an okay singer but ruben was better too bad they got rid of frenchie davis to quote funkadelic the girl is bad.
i just love this cd after i got the cd i must have played it over and over for days there is not a song that isnt great everything is sung with such heart i think clay aiken is the best thing to happen to pop music in a long time no gimmicks just pure talent.
this cd sent chills down my spine clay aiken is a very gifted vocalist.
this toy is absolutely terrible i gave it one star only because zero is not an option my son really wanted this toy and when he got it he played with it for about  minutes and walked away even a four year old can see how lame this toy is it comes with a trigger that is supposed to eject some kind of orange ramp to launch a car nice concept except the thing doesnt come out all the way so my son ends up pulling the thing out there are missiles that are supposed to attach to the side according to the instructions they dont the tower keeps falling off of it all around i cant believe how poorly designed this toy is for the money you would think i bought it at the dollar store or something i would urge all who consider buying this toy to talk your kid into something else its terrible.
i have to agree with alot of the other posts on this one santa brought this for my daughter who loves teen titans for christmas the instructions what there is of them is very hard to decipher the orange launch thing would not work and i had to take apart the little red switch that the control thing fits on to make the organge track pop out the red switch was not in the right position from factory even then the orange track does not fold all the way out also like alot of other reviewers the tower tips over very easily i just dont feel like i am getting what i am paying for these days when it comes to toys.
i take this daily and it seems to have assisted with my acne and other health complaints a higher dose helped considerably with the common cold along with taking vitamin c and garlic.
listen to the other reviews this book is just an encyclopedia of waste at least an encyclopedia has pictures and example.
this book is a complete waste of time i had been very skeptical of the technology being only a shortcut for java web hacks and scriptkittys and i was unfortunately right those that can explain how jsp cannot truely conform to the mvc methodology should really read this book it would serve them right reading this boring drivel instead of actually learning the core jee web framework ted husted should be beaten with this book or an actual car struti love most of tools that come out of the jakarta project but here is a suggestion learn and know each of the tools suggested for mvc impletementations and skip the gimmic tools like struts turbine and velocity in the event you do buy this book please consider its many other usesi know for me it has been instrumental for leveling my air conditioner.
the watch is in perfect condition but cannot set the time and it keeps going dead i thought it was a new watch but acts like a used watch i wont order from this vendow again.
this album jams yes it is old school influenced but it is a lot catchy fresh technopop jam.
the filter works fine and i was about to order another i paid  for it  months ago and now it is almost  i mean we all expect to pay a little more when we buy items later on but more than  times as much.
this movie is for you if a you are over  and still read comic booksb believe that someone would believe that taking a blue pill would make them a supermanc then spend their life trying to enact their powers contrary to all reality telling them otherwised find humor in the situations that people with reduced mental functioning find themselvese and dont know that unless distorted the reality of such individuals is too mundane for a movief and that some cheaply made movies are not made to convey an altruistic message but to make money.
thought this film was very funny well done acting was great directing was gritty but worked well for this movie and its storywould highly recommend if you like dark comedies.
i would consider myself a radio damn yankees fan having only heard their radio hits like dont tread on me and high enough after hearing this essentials cd though i see that theres more than meets the ear the only song on here that i cant seem to get into is come again but all the others are real rockers for me from the milder silent is broken to the fast and heavy piledriver this cd never stops the guitars vocals bass and drums all rock i tend to give conservative ratings so thats why i gave this a  out of  stars but otherwise i would highly recommend it for any other radio fans like myself.
this version of beowulf should not be compared at all to the original text of beowulf students should not be taught that this story as recreated by robert nye is reflective of the beowulf written about  ad the story developed and shared for hundreds of years is characterized by christian concepts and ideals this version written by robert nye reflects our societies overwhelming desire to rewrite history dechristianizing it as they go along robert nye has replaced the christian god of the original beowulf with the mythological viking god odin the original beowulf tale supports the historical significance that christian beliefs and ideas had on the overall society of england and throughout europe robert nye has done a great injustice in adjusting an historical document to reflect his own convictions or lack thereof.
this book is almost all actoin about a man who is a very strong and kind warrior he knows that the goodness inside of him can defeat any evil he uses that knowlage to kill monsters the book is a little confusing at times but everything elese is very creative and understandable i would sugjest this book to  year old and up for the concern of some grusome scense it is only  pages a good lengh for a bedside book by the waybeowulf is the guy on the horse not the monster on the cover .
when this lp came out in  a billboard ad stated the most powerful instrument in music returnsand it did this chaka lp is one of her best and it shows how to use power vocals correctly i think this lp was ahead of its timea great fusion of r.
im afraid that i must agree with the comments of tedious below apart from a wonderful idea for the theme of this novel eastern religion meets western technology their was not enough character or plot development to sustain my interest past the halfway mark this book has been praised as an influence by some very great authors but i must assume it was the theme and not the narrative itself that caught their fancy the narative reads like a poor translation really bad style a few funny moments but overall a very dissapointing book for me considering its high falutin reputation ill stick with huxley if and when i seek enlightenment.
first of all ike is doing the very thing that tina always said he would do ike turner will never admit to what he did to tina tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like all the others ike took advantage of her tina her self said she cared very much for him cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince tina to leave him even the girls that danced with tina on stage had whitnessed what happenedtina did not write her autobiography to promote her career she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on so she released her autobiography in  well after her comeback in while ike can try to deny it all he wants the truth is he violently abused tina and considering the person ike turner is i would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a patheticexcusse of a comeback.
i have been taking these for  months i dont love taking  tabs a day but they seem to work best when you do the price is better then some of the other products on the market also.
whats most amazing is the tape recording of his final speech to convince all the parents to begin giving their children poison only one headstrong black woman speaks up with a speech that these babies deserve to live sadly the interviewer just lets the survivors ramble when most seem quite willing to answer tough follow up questions it needed at least another hour.
esta excelente el producto es tal como lo esperaba y bueno por supuesto el servicio de entrega fue inmediato.
if a textbook for hindi must use some romanistion then it should use the same system as rsmcgregors oxford hindienglish dictionary as teach yourself hindi does the authors of that title rsnell  sweightman teach hindi at london universitys school of oriental and african studiesfurther this textbook relegates the devanagari script to the rear of the book and includes no devanagari at all for the tape dialoguesas a final black mark the standard reached in the course is way short of snellweightmann this is partly a product of having  lessons instead of recommendation  get snell  weightmann and then mcgregors dictionary and grammar use bhatia if you need extra tape practice.
i have read all philip yancey books  he gives an intellegent  amazing insight of the true religious life demonstrated in the bible this provides a person the detailed readings therein its relationship to everyday life experiences  all is in proper perspective its also an excellent tool for bible study i have it in printed book form  also on my ereaderdont leave home without it.
i was very pleased at how quickly i received my purchase it was for a gift and i tend to be a procrastinator at getting things.
the other reviews cover the show well so i wont go into that but i do want to warn you that the dvd case is really cheap with the dvds doubled up in the same slot for the sake of  cents cost to them they have produced something that is very likely to scratch your dvds.
i like this show but then again i like syfi amanda tapping is a good actress enjoyed her in stargate sg and in the show sanctuary she does a great english imitation.
after enjoying the first series of sanctuary i have recently purchased the second season looking forward to the continuation of some good story lines i have been incredibly let down the first season had some shoddy effects but somehow they have deteriorated into something even worse there is very poor interaction between animations and cast i could perhaps forgive this if there was something else good about the series unfortunately they have really destroyed what was a good series i have watched  episodes and am unsure i will watch any more the acting is poor the storyline is worse the new characters are uninspired and i have no motivation to watch any more as its definitely not getting any better if you enjoyed the first series you are better off leaving it there and not ruining the series by watching this series you have been warned.
the accuracy of this thermometer is really poor i returned the thermometer for an exchange from amazon the replacement has same problem i did calibrate it still it shows wrong temperature i liked ease of mounting on the window and size but completely useless as fas as what value it shows for the temperature.

something to always look foward to in a sequal is the gameplay you loved from the first thats the great thing about outbreak  it has the same controls but this time you can choose who you want to play with you for instance if david does not work well with kevin but works well with jim then you can choose jim as your partner plus you can walk as you shoot the only downside is that theres not going to be a outbreak file  .
the new resident evil outbreak is boring i expected it to be actionpacked boy was i wrong every level has like  zombies i rented the game to shoot zombies not infected animals my advice try it at a friends house or play a demo first.
i am a grandmother with no woodworking experience i made the foolish decison to put up large crown moulding in my bedroom and got hopelessly stuck at the inside and outside corners i looked for help on the net and found this book three days later i finished the job and the corners were absolutely perfect the directions are written and illustrated so that anyone can follow them i have more trouble making a souffle than i had working with crown moulding  thanks to this book it should be in everyone doityourselfers library by the way i saved a fortune doing this project myself.
my daughter almost  enjoyed this book from the library last halloween  were looking forward to reading it again this halloween i loved introducing her to halloween from a book that emphasized friendship and generosity among neighbors rather than scary monsters pranks or candy the illustrations were lovely im sure the original edition had beautiful illustrations too and the previous reviewer might have been chagrinned by the changes to a personal childhood favorite but im guessing that most people who like my family discover the story for the the first time in this edition will find nothing amiss.
kirk whalum is a fantastic saxophonist but this one is a disaster it doesnt deserve a mention let alone a place in the collection of true jazz lovers please do not judge whalum by this cd id recommend unconditional instead.
i didnt knew that amazon had such a poor quality control and also they dont have any control over other vendors save  by not buying this product very thin and very large sized shirts  they are see thru and look no where like they are shown on web site .
this shirt is absolutely the worst in the market the fabric is cheap so cheap that i threw the darn thing away.
first off the shirts are good they are thin but they look good the collar tips have builtin plastic strips to keep them pointed and crisp they come out of the dryer pretty good wo wrinkles if you use the wrinkleguard cycle however the shirt in the picture is not at all what they send you the shirt in this pic above has a much tougher textured material and the actual shirt has a white label not black as in the pic so expect a very thin smooth untextured but stylish shirt with crisp collars that look good that comes out of the dryer nice but the shirt in the pic is not the shirt you get.
of course the list price is a joke however for the price the quality is quite good it uses thin material but is fine for summer it is about  size larger than most brands so you might want to go for the smaller sizes just remember this is not your  deparment store shirt and yes only the blue colors look good.
if you want a cheap thin shirt that likely will not last a dozen washing then this is the shirt for yoube aware that amazon has a  plus per item return shipping feeis all bill blass stuff this quality.
i bought this shirt for one reason the price and i soon as i open the box i found out why it was so cheap because of the cheap materials save your money spend couple of dollars more and you will be happier with quality.
as mentioned by other reviewers this dvd is just horrible to watch because of the absurd amount that the cameras cut away to another scene every few seconds if you want to watch a guitar solo or anything else for that matter to absorb any details forget it the editors didnt do the scorpions justice the music is good but since this is a dvd and not a cd im giving two stars for the spazoid video technique.
this book was very boring very few moments in the book are actually exciting and they are few and far between the beginning of the book is the best part it spent too much time explaining and describing image.
while reading this book i was extremely fascinated and into it in the beginning but as the book goes on the main character continues to classify underwater creatures over and over and over the only thing that kept me reading until the end was the mystery of captain nemo which i have to say was never really revealed and a bit disapointing ending so all together and very detailed and interesting book but too slow and boring overall.
i have seen the movie needs to be remade wih today special effects come on disney and really enjoyed the book.
this book is a classic no question thats why i chose to read it when it came out in the s it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many a ship that could travel under the water but reading it in  much of the novelty of the book has been realized we have had submarines for nearly a centurybut even aside from that there is little plot to the novel it reads as if it were written by a committee at national geographic its a survey of all the unique items and places in the worlds oceans the little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship and the ending not to ruin it is a total copout and disappointingi was hoping this book would stand the test of time like the time machine or even around the world in  days but i found it a rather boring and drudging read.
a mysterious creature is haunting the seas and professor aronnax is determined to discover the origins of the beast however the encounter brings more than he ever expected as he is captured by the strange and withdrawn captain of a submarine ship and whirled around the worlds oceans the aquatic wonders he experiences thrill his academic soul while the actions and motivations of his host leave him questioning both the individual and civilizations at largevernes underwater adventure is the latest novel i have read to my toddler at bedtime and is far from my favorite as we finished the third verne novel we have approached i found myself lamenting a brilliant story bogged down by careless pros.

snl deserves a comprehensive overview that tells us how they put together the show and howwhy it mattersmattered this is not that book the author simply has no objectivity so he cant tell us the truth if you want to read what you already know about the shows popular sketches this is the book to read we learn almost nothing about how personalities worked together or not to make the show last this long far too little time is spent on the first  years and that first amazing cast but if you want to hear about pat and victoria jackson this is the book for you a real mess.
i choose this book because it was economically priced the book was kind of in rough condition on the outside cover but the inside was totally fine the description of the book was completely accurate.
if you took out every comment by cast writers and producers on trying unsuccessfullyto figure out lorne michaels this heavy tome would easily be cut in half too much whining too little interesting historical information for me a long time fan of the show.
good stuff  some funny some serious but all the little stories youve never heard from behind the curtain at snl.
it was a great choice between bd and dvd of course i bought the bd as you all know the quality is far more better than regular dvd the movie had a pretty good opening to and it was very catchy story has a pretty good plot to it but it wasnt as good as the first movie there were more action on the first movie compared to this all in all it was a great and fun movie to watch.
i was disappointed with this seller i got an empty dvd case that was shrink wrapped the most frustrating part about it was i never received a response back from the seller after trying to get in contact over and over again there goes my hard earned cash.
if you enjoyed the book you wont want to watch the disney version of this movie characterization was changed a friendly dwarf became a nasty grump prince caspian and king peter had jealousy issues.
omg this was terrific i was so pleased that all the actorsactresses from tl tw atw came back to prince caspian it was awesome the sword fights the battles the waking of the trees reepicheep and the bits of humor mixed in here and there i loved it.
too long and too precious this second narnia film still finds the children in wartime england waiting for a train when they are abruptly called back to narnia hundreds of years after their visit from the wardrobe once again evil outsiders are threatening to overwhelm the animals and folk of narnias forests the children eventually save the day and return to the train station after heroic battles and soul searching speechifying although technically amazing the story is drawn out to a sense of boredom and the characters other than the children lack a strength and sharpness that made the first film so enjoyable it isnt a film well watch again and again as we have wardrobe.
the software mentioned on my may th review is called avid xpress  not avid express  when my review was edited someone changed the spelling possibly thinking it was a typomistake.
this is a quick reference or trainer use it to help scouts with their knot requirements simple diagrams take the used step by step through each knot.
in no way does this little card set replace books or experience but for field use for common knots especially in a stressful situation its priceless ive already needed it on so many occasions work and around the yard that i moved one of them from my bob to my small edc pouch if youre anything like me kind of knowing how to tie a specific knot can get you into more trouble than not having tied the darn thing in the first place i had to secure some items for an typhoon and boy did this thing come in handy all of my ropes and knots stayed tight unlike my usual poststorm assessment of finding them untied and strung out in the yard yes you could probably make a set but these are nicely printed on credit card like material albeit a bit thinner and are really legible and handy if you have a bob this is a must have especially for those you think you need  of  cord in your bobfour stars because i wish you could separate the cards for easier access.
i ordered this mainly to learn some knots this is nice to throw in the backpack and take out for a camping trip use the examples to try out some knotsgood product very useful.
this is pretty cool it shows you how to tie some basic knots that can come come in handy in various situations i got this so i can leave it in my go bag with ft of some paracord.
a beautiful book with detailed descriptive lovely drawings this gift to my granddaughter was well received and she takes it to bed every night.
a movie needs to be done about this guy dont listen to al sharpton if booker t can do what he did anyone can id give it  stars but for the style of writing at the time leaves me wanting coffee.
i look forward to trying many of the recipes and really appreciate the nutritional information however the information is based on a portion of the recipe such as  of recipe this is really not helpful when the recipe is for a pot of soup the soup would have to be divided into  servings to get an accurate calorie count even with that drawback i know i will enjoy some of the dishes.
factually shaky at many points pedestrian prose selfaggrandizing and a page turner only for wanting to finish the awful thing what i found most offensive about this book was the authors egotistical disdain for the lesser climbers of the team in fact she and her fellow leaders showed nothing but hostility to many members and they all come off as smug arrogant jerks having been on climbing expeditions before there is a great deal of stress raw feelings etc but the raw and condescending behavior of the author and trip leaders is disgusting dont even get started on their ugly american analysis of asians on denaliread this book if you one day want to write a mountaineering book and this one will point to every flaw in doing so.
the more you know about mountaineering the funnier youll find this book there is little to like but much to laugh at in ruth anns utterly unselfconscious selfportraitif this were a comic novel it would be a deadon parody of a certain strain of selfglorifying mountaineering literature think nicholson baker writing into thin air from the point of view of sandy hill pittman and it starts with the twentytwoword long titlewarning if youre not in the mood to laugh be prepared to be annoyed.
a must read for anyone preparing to climb you will understand that mountainclimbing is not for the flippant the hurried the unprepared this extraordinary story tells of the extreme suffering endured to achieve the summit you learn about the death zone and about what happens to the body at various altitudes an excellent adventure story for both men and women.
i also was really looking forward to reading this book but had to force myself to finish as a redhead i feel armed with some more knowledge about the history of redheads but was left hanging somehowi found it disjointed and it was not an enjoyable read.
since i have a redheaded daughter this sounded lioke a fun book to read i gave it up just about  of the way through maybe it got better but i wasnt going to stay around to find out the author really stretched it to make her point her point maybe becasue shes a redhead she wanted to be so very very special so she took a few supposed facts and made a whole concept from them come on trying to make redheads all some sort of special witches monmsters superhuman people was dumb and she totally dissed redheaded men my husband read it through but we both quickly decided not to send it to our daughter.
i really wanted to love this moisturizer i have very fair sensitive skin and this was supposed to be one of the best bets for my skin type it also has a great high spfbut alas it does not sink into my skin it does not blend well at all it leaves a terrible white residue that takes forever to rub inmaybe because of the high spf i am not surebut i was definitely disappointed.
the series is excellent and faithful to the literary history surrounding the robin hood legends clannads music adds a bit of authenticity as does the use of magic and superstition and the uk settingacorn did a reasonably good job digitizing and adding subtitles to the original film colour was on the dark side but nothing that cant be adjustedthe poor packaging of the complete set prevents me from giving it a perfect score i like the look and the foldingbook concept of it but the casing is made of hard plastic making it prone to chipping and difficult to remove the dvds carefully without breaking or cracking them i had a similar problem with the i spy  fourpack collection cases so take care to remove the dvds lest you damage them permanently you might consider alternative storage like a plastic cd envelope case considering this dvd set is not cheapaside from this i highly recommend the complete robin hood set.
picture is fuzzy not digitallly remastered also disk  had a glitch in it on the first play disk is clean over all quality is not great.
the image shown is exactly what youll ge.
what makes this film truly great is how many different styles of comedy it has you see not only slapstick and situation based comedy but also some fabulous dialog and scare comedy i didnt want to watch this movie at first thinking itd be a run of the mill bw film but was amazed and immediately rewound and watched it a second time.
this book is a pure pleasure reading for anyone interested in statistics but wants to have a break from formulas and software in fact i would make it a must read for all citizens who are bombarded by overcomplicated news about all areas of our life.
someone once said there are three kinds of liars liars damn liars and statisticiansi read this book in high school and it shaped my judgement of the news media business and advertising ever since never trust the numbers without knowing their basis and remember a statistician is the type of guy who would put his head in an oven and his feet in a bucket of ice and say that on average he felt fine.
although how to lie with statistics is a bit dated having been written in the s the principles it puts forth are still valid todayif not moreso than everand the material is delivered in clear concise and even entertaining anecdotes and illustrationshow often do you hear statistics bandied about in the media or used to try to prove some specialinterest point of course the people quoting the figures must be right with numbers on their sides until you look at just how those numbers were arrived atthis book isnt truly a guide on how to lie with statistics but it is an excellent text that informs the reader both how others will lie to them using statistics and on how to interpret the validity of purported statistical data.
how to lie with statistics is a fun and informative look at the was in which statisticians try to decieve the public with misleading statistics every chapter contains plenty of realworld examles that provide excellent insight into the concepts the book is a quick read only  pages and it holds the readers attentio.
this book is a very good primer for getting ones feet wet in the world of nonprofit organizations while it is by no means exhaustive it is certainly broad and deep enough for anyone to run their nonprofit more efficiently and more ethically it covers excellent project team and board building strategies as well as nearly every type of fundraising and solicitation additionally there is good information on employing the internet for communication engagement and fundraising  still a fairly new field for manyappendices ac cover some very good tools and examples though the listed government grant sources in appendix d focus mainly upon the humanities and the arts valuable web sources are given for finding grants in other areas.

this collection amounts to three dollarstore discs jammed into a pretty package for those who prefer substance over style look elsewhere for this material which is given a pretty shoddy presentation overalldisc  which was unplayable on the two dvd players i tried it on repeats the entire contents of disc  and adds the tv pilots kooks tour and jerks of all trades  making disc  a pointless redundancy avoid it at all costs.
you get what you pay for with this set only contains maybe an hour of classic stooge fun it may fill the gap in someones collection but mostly contains fillers and short dvds it appears to be a collection of videos that no one else wanted one full dvd is the lame three stooges cartoons if you are looking for classic stooge comedy this set contains very little.
the price was attractive as was the packaging the box shows curly but alas  curly is not easily found in this compilation also  a lot of the extra features are lame stay away from this product if you really want the three stooges  buy the  volume compilation from sony instead.
the three stooges collectors editionthe box says dvds over  hours what they dont say is that there are only  classic stooges shorts and only on the first dvd the rest of the set is crap the reamaining   dvds  hours are patched together bad movies and cartoons  remember the really bad stooges cartoons you wouldnt even watch back in the s it is intentionaly misrepresented the packaging is first class a real eyegrabber but whats inside is junk.
i read this book many yeawrs ago and decided to buy it again and read it i enjoyed it but will not read it again.
go to a used bookstore search the internet scour the newsgroups and find this book i have never read a novel before nor since that has the power to terrify the way the late tryon does here his mastery of sentence structure alone puts him above the vast majority of horror novelists simply a sensational piece of work  and a travesty that its out of print.
cheeks grove is the hook on this cd  chico has that groovy back beat and always a top notch bandworth a listen big daddy.
as philosophy of science this work is very fascinating unfortunately it is permeated with rather marxist ideas which the author seems to cherish but as an incissive criticism of reductionist science especially biology it is very good.
reading this is reading a master at work pinsky wields so much skill its ridiculous reading the poems here is like listening to an intelligent old man sitting in a chair somewhere in a field giving his thoughts free rein following them where they land in my opinion the poem the figured wheel is a lyrical breathtaking masterpiece.
pinsky is in love with being a poet but his poems dont mean anything to the rest of us this book is a perfect example of this we are supposed to admire him not read him and i find it a shame that this lousy work got him a luareateship.
i like em a lot wife thinks theyre the best cereal shes ever had teen daughter thinks they taste just a bit better than hamster food the others here like them enough bags are pretty small but still a good enough deal that ill buy again just too good and a unique flavorreally like the pumpkin seeds in them not to.
this is a great resource for victorious living it shows the consequences of choices each of us make in our lives and how important it is to make the right choice to live a life of true freedom and liberty it is a quick read  i was fascinated with the stories shared from the beginning and had a hard time putting the book down i got copies for my family to help encourage them as they are getting ready to enter the dating stage of their lives to help them stay on course and help give them the tools to save themselves for marriage as god intended i highly recommend this book  whether youre married or single.
this is a fine randolph scott film unfortunately the dvd has interference on the audio channel bassheavy contemporary music as if someone was playing something through the board when the transfer was made and the print itself shows damage in places i have never encountered a major studio release with this level of audio interference thanks for caring columbia pictures.
item was just as described very nice fitdoes not slip down your leg and also securely holds your weapon i would definitely buy this again perfect.
ruarke is rightfully called the master of outdoor writing this is a fabulously written story of his first safari in kenya and tanganyika now tanzania it is a must read for anyone who enjoys outdoor literature hunting stories or africa.
this eight pound bag lasts our cockatoo  months way more economical to buy here on amazon than in the store we reseal it for storage and use it well before it goes stale colours and smells still vibrant.
i have to say i havent actually read this book but i feel like if you are considering giving this author a chance to influence your eternal salvation you ought to give the nice people who come knocking at your door a chance too then pray about what you have learned and decide for yourself but if you want to celebrate over choco tacos you would have to go to taco johns i used to work there and they are the ones who sell the tasty treat see other reviews for this book to understand what i am talking about.
its the truth that early mormon leaders told fanciful tales about moon men and the lost ten tribes    to their kids at bedtime it seems theres a difference between what a mormon leader says from the puplit as official doctrine and what they say having fun with their family its the same with anyone this book takes snippets from private journals and attempts to pass them off as official doctrine as a howto book this one just doesnt worka better book to buy from amazon on this subject is tinkling cymbals and sounding brass  the art of telling tales about joseph smith and brigham young the collected works of hugh nibley vol   hugh nibley david j whittaker editor  hardcover  published .
dont get me wrong harriet the spy was one of my all time favorite books and movies growing up im almost  now and had always wanted to read the long secret so after rereading harriet i went to the bookstore and ordered myself a copy well at first it wasnt so bad but there really wasnt any real point to the story harriet hadnt matured much at all and to make matters worse really offensive and hostile notes were left all over the place i am also a christian and find it offensive that the phrase jesus hates you should be allowed to be published in a childrens book this is especially true in this day and age when almost any threat has the potential to turn violentskip this one.
just didnt like this book it seem to be crude and its really a book for girls only.
this product is light in weight and good for smaller non parralel limb bows i have a mathews reezen and it was too small amazon has a great return policy and traded for plano max xt.
this book presents a marian version of the traditional greek orthodox jesus prayer instead of lord jesus christ son of the living god have mercy on me a sinner sister reveals that jesus has told her to constantly repeat the phrase jesus mary i love you save souls while on the surface the prayer is very simple it is difficult in practice because of the requirements of purity of mind intense desire and continuous repetition sister says that jesus finds the prayer most pleasing of great benefit to all souls living and deceased and with the help of grace can be done by anyone this is a method of prayer for the littlest ones of all ages.
i returned this product the legs were too big and the waist too small i looked like i was in a strait jacket i have the high back waist cincher and am pleased with it other than the rubber smell i cant elimate but this product sucks.
leaving the issues for apostates and apologists to bicker over this book simply looks at the lives of people actually in the church what they do in their normal every day lives i especially liked the depictions of latterday saints in nations outside the united states including the temple trip down the amazon and a few shots of victoria peak beliver or no these pictures tell  words about a people that are industrious optimistic and compassionate these photos aver that while many continue to criticize and ostracize this church the latterday saints frequently hold the moralethical highground on their idealogical opponents how many other year old american religions would stand under this kind of acrosstheglobe scrutiny this book contains real in your face irrefutable evidence that like them nor not the mormons are indeed a peculiar people.
i enjoyed this book a great deal the story was very interesting and kept the reader guessing i thought that many issues in the book were easy for students to relate to even today the author didnt pull any punches in this startling work i enjoyed this book and recommend it for students in sixth grade and up.
i have never read a book that was so boring the book talked about a jewish girl helping out a nazi nothing happens inthe begining and the climax is the girl housing the nati wownot weas a class read this book as a class and i asked everyone what they thought of the book they all agreed with me.
although at first glance the book seems to have a good plot it does not i didnt like the character of patty she seemed so pathetic and she whined too much the relationship between patty and anton is very disturbing becuase patty is weird about how she reactes when she is around anton the book disturbed me.
this was a present for my boyfriend he seems to like it it arrived in a very reasonable time it seems to be very sturdy and easy to operate.
this book was an interesting reading for me it was one of the best school readings i have been assigned it was a up front look at a man looking to uncover his fathers past his style of writing was upfront and direct we did not feel compelled to censor his minds work of placing swear words in the text where needed or being vague about intimate love sessions that had taken place i most enjoyed the idea of the gocart club the inventiveness of having this club to lure in the king is one of the most original ideas that i have read in a long while the book also has a sense of being a bit personal i do not know henry bromell only that he is good friends with ny english teacher but from reading this book i have a sense that i know a little about him that is why i believe people write books is to allow the readers to have a brief glimpse inside the authors mind and life he has in my opinion succeeded in doing so with little america.
fine as an introduction to duncan but not for serious study at best this is a greatest hits recordthough that said its a bit like buying bob dylans greatest hits its good in that it touches every portion of his career but since duncan worked so fiercely in the poetics of the series and the idea of the book of poetry ultimately it leaves the reader wanting.
we outgrew our x tents with the kids so we bought this tent preparing for our next camp trip we test it out at our back yard right after we bought it its easy to set up and roommy however the zippers are done in very low end quality the window zippers work ok but both the door zipper did not work well the mesh zipper will open up after you zipped it the door zipper is not well stiched on one side and its hard to zip it aroundwe are return it back to the store tomorrow.
i bought this tent brand new and had it for one year and opened it up one time to put it up and brought on a fishing trip and the string thats in the tent poles broke in  places and the zippers are terrible always get caughtits roomy but its cheap.
this rice cooker works great my only complaint is with amazon this is the nd nonbook item ive ordered from amazon and i dont understand why these items are only shipped in their mfg packaging with no exterior boxing thankfully this item arrived in good shape this is something to think about when ordering nonbook items from amazon.
if your a fan of the games you will enjoy the anime watching the familiar characters i like the dubbing i am a dubb person i perfer it so its rare i ever complaint about it good series having played the games you will enjoy it more art style is diffrent its a good different nice change  for the price i paid  bucks its worth it.
maybe it was my bad to buy a knockoff product that was so cheap compared to gum brand picks doctors brushpicks are unusable the picks have no flexibility or give maybe i could use them to clean out tiny metal machine parts.
this dvd is amazing braid is rock at its finest if you get a chance you must see them on their reunion tour the extras are hands down the best on any live dvd i have seen this knocked the impossibles never say goodbye dvd out of my player finally.
this book was written before the pci express standard was ratified so much of the information is speculative nevertheless it is well written and complete.
i used to love this perfume and used for years but the last two times i bought it from perfume world or i give someone to use i have noticed that it smells worse than sweat  horrible i dont believe this is the original perfume something somewhere is not right with it but the original real paloma picasso was excellent everyone used to ask me what i was wearing and where to get it my  down the drain next time will try to buy from macys like i used to and see if i can get the original paloma.
yoos arguments in favor of an essentially unchecked executive fly in the face of everything that the founders intended when creating our great country he is undoubtedly intelligent given the prowess with which he manipulates the constitution and legal precepts into seemingly supporting his own theory despite the packaging however the fundamental basis for his theory is fatally flawed he is at his core merely an opportunist who advocates theories for the sole purpose of furthering his own career rather than because they actually have merit in other words hes just a hack at heart this book isnt worth your time or money.
this book contains exactly one chapter on hydroponics and its not a very good chapter as a general book on growing its not bad but anything that purports itself as being a grow bible should include extensive information on evaluating hydroponics systems and mediums and how to use and maintain them throughout a grow this book contains some information on this but not nearly enough for whatever reasons it includes far more information on genetics and breeding but most growers i know buy clones or seeds those pages would have been better devoted to all things hydroponicsis there a good book focused primarily on indoor hydroponic growing not sure i need it now but it would have been great to have a few months back.
some ideas in this book are as helpful as any newspapers garden section there are evident growing errors in this book if you are a beginner or intermediate grower this book may misguide your gardening efforts if you want real facts there are better sources out there.
this book was a great find it has more information than pictures which is okay it is very descript in its information and easy to read id recommend this book to anyone looking to further their knowlegde in this art.
this book never shipped ordered over  weeks ago smazon still says ships within  weeks it has been  weeks past their estimated ship date so dont bother ordering this book.
this book is a sure snoozefest luckily for me i did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class we read selected chapters of the bookthey writing was horrible many parts were unclear i had to reread what i read over and over i cant stand this style of writing barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent instead he comes off as boring and pretentiousskip this book try something else.
it is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly i cannot be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator but it certainly does not measure up to this criterion it may be of interest to photography academics but i doubt if a photographer will get much out of it that is useful.
i had this vhs tape years ago but no longer own it im looking for the dvd version of it because it is one of the most enjoyable workouts tapes ive ever doneand ive done a lot of them.
this is a great intermediate video its one of my favorites its set to motown music and its very fun the moves are dancy but donna has great cueing and after a couple of times you get it down i dont like videos that are easy the first couple of times through because i get bored to fast i recommend this video to anyone who enjoys dancy aerobics its fun.
for the first time i read a book in which i thought the artist was sitting in the room and telling me about her life the is one of the most inspiring eclectic and electrifying books i have ever read its just fabulous.
i admit i did not read the back of this cd carefully i happily bought it and popped it into the cd player anticipating the wonderful tunes i had heard throughout the movie but my favorites werent there the most important missing item its tough to be a god as sung by the stars of the movie elton johns duet with randy newman just isnt as much fun its not a bad album really i was just disappointed.
the king of crocodile rock lost his teeth  years ago but here he is again  plugging away in geezer fm heaven while old pharts may love the way johns campy cream puff crooning fluffs up their depends kids will absolutely hate this flaccidlythemed soundtrack of paintbynumber sugar pop fizz and bombastic likastik storytelling incredibly the road to el dohrado is worse than elts last tim rice collaboration aida the  multiguest stinker currently being loaded in skeet machines around the world indeed the only level this one works on is a cheap alternative for parents who want to sedate their hyperactive whippersnappers without having to shell out big bucks for a ritalin prescription give it a rest elton for gawds sake.
i was thinking that this was a cd where the music was taken from the movie not all resung by elton john the songs lost the flavor i was looking for if youre an elton john fan you probably would like it.
totally fun and captivating with creativty for children  plus lots of stuff for older brotherssisters as well as mondad or any extended family member to partake in great pace for all perfect music and voice and a nice outdoor background lending itself to an uplifting and yet mellow moodeveryone will be inspired to increase their mentalemotional calmness physical coordination flexibility as well as focus of mind alone and with friendsfamily.
the book i ordered was a gift i am sure they will enjoy reading it but it took a very long time to get here disappointed in that.
once i started reading this book i could not put it down it gave me even more respect for those of this generation after reading this book i had to order mr brokaws other books.
excellent book with profiles of folks who survived wwii and came back to our country to make a productive life for themselves the format is very readable and the stories enjoyable despite some very serious pictures presented of the war.
tom brokaw has chosen a fanastic topic the baby boomers parents their life  times trials  stamina through the depression wars and raising families i wish an author with a bit of distance and vision would have done the actual writing of this book as it is brokaw cannonizes his subjects and does a poor job telling the real story i hope this topic gets explored further by someone other than brokaw who has little talent as a writer i was very disappointed reading this book and i made the mistake of buying gift copies for my elderly war vet friend  neighbors and my own father without prereading it live and learn i guess sorry i had expectations of being thrilled with this bookbut wasnt.
rather than letting his subjects tell their stories brokaw interjects his politics and philosophy i donated my copy to the city library instead read studs terkels the good war it is what brokaw could have had if he would have imitated the master oral biographer.
mr brokaw couldnt possibly imagine the conditions under which most young men were living when called upon to save their nationmrbrokaw found mostly officers to interviewmost of whom went into the service as officersand later became politicians where are the uneducatedpoverty stricken youths who went into the armed forcesfought and died for their country and those who survivedreturned to their former lives little better off than before being drafted the author never mentioned the fact that machinery is always in place to keep our rich youths out of the servicemaking their service in our armed forces strictly voluntar.
a very moving and informative book a friend gave me this book shortly after my father passed after reading it it made me realize what my father went through when he was in wwii this book helped me bring me closer to my fatherthis book is full of stories of wwii vets what happened to them and how it changed there life and how they succeeded.
i am tremendously inspired by the stories contained in this book the american spirit during wwii is unequalled especially compared to the sick societies of japan and germany whether this generation is the greatest or not there is no doubt in my mind that the cooperative effort that was required to defend freedom and defeat the fascists is without a doubt the greatest effort in history.
mostly pontification wheres the scholarship the only reason i sat through this one was that it was an audio book and i was on an eight hour drive if this is the greatest generation im in the generation that got the bill this book glossed over most everything if anything it proved the opposite of its title.
brokaw writes not like a veteran newsman but like an awestruck heroworshipping kid thats not a crime but one expects more from a man with brokaws experience and training i felt the text was very shallow  especially in the final section when he interviews celebrities one doesnt learn a lot in this section nor does one get any meaningful insights i also felt there was a tremendous sameness about the interviews surely there were people who had bitter memories or less than passionately patriotic views brokaw could have presented a more accurate picture of the generation by including a dissenting opinion or two regrettably one has to wonder about the accuracy of his reporting on nbc news.
i used to enjoy tom brokaw when he was nbc anchor man as a critical and competent journalist his book however is a real disappiontment for me belonging to the postwar generation it reads as a very shallow hurrapatriotism story without any ctitical investigation of the time priode he covers not everything this generation did was so great and i would have expected from a critical journalist like tom brokaw to take this aspect into consideration as well in this sense it is not very demanding book.
i bought some because it was advertised as a healthy snack choice only to find out when it arrived that it has half a gram of trans fat per serving due to its use of a partially hydrogenated oil.
years ago i had purchased some vtech products and was very displeased with the their quality at that time i swore never to buy vtech againwhile recently seeking cordless phones with speakerphone options i came across the i the price was right and some time had passed so i bought two sets home and office in june theres only a three month warranty on these units and one set recently  died after finally getting through to vtech support and troubleshooting with them we couldnt revive the system the phones are useless and im stuck with themyou can guess my advice.
looks cool key word people looks cool it isnt bullet proof please dont think it is or that pockets make you look the part.
this book along with all other books and seminars on tech analysis are mere ploys to make the authors wealthy.
i bought the book because i think it is of the latest edition edition  but obviously it is not although it is printed in amazon should specify the edition of the book.
these paper back editions are pirated and unauthorized they do not contain the modern emendationsdo not be deceived and if you have already bought it protest to amazon.
the book is the reprint of a old edition date back  with some little update up to  the amazons searchinsidetm refer to another update version of the book  ed the books style and content is very old the charts are handmade and frankly speaking now its possible to do much better and the calculation of indicators now can be exact if you are interested to the prehistory of technical analysis a would suggest welles wilder  new concepts in technical trading systems modern and better books are those of achelis and colby.

this is a great bathroom reader i find that the references to geographical locations as the word names a bit off but i imagine inventing new words would be quite challenging.
this is a very good cd there is no song on this cd that i dont like even though the radio only plays one song.
johnson a clinical psychologist who is a graduate of fuller seminary and fuller graduate school of psychology writes a clear and careful study of the psychological factors that can unconsciously affect the way people read the bible he points out how issues of perception cognitive process social interaction and culture can shape how a person interprets scripture he writes from a committed evangelical position and is not by any means reducing the meaning of scripture to merely human processes or psychology still he does caution against the naivete that says i dont interpret the bible i just read what it saysthis is an essential volume for anyone interested in psychology religion and the bible.
my dell  has mb of ram total more then one program running and it would slow down sometimes freeze i took out the two mb sticks and purchased two of these getting a total of mb its still not a lot compared to modern laptops but it was a noticeable improvement now i can get on the internet while a program is running and not have it slow down nice product.
the introduction mix with lot of unusual verbal loud and unpleasant voice i dont understand it even but i like seane demonstration seane is a fantastic demonstrator thats advantage of her the sequence is really senseless for detox flow but its good for beginner without full audio mixid like to ask why the video starts with about  minutes of advertisement its something they give this dvd as free gifti tried both workout twist and flow purify really its not going to work with detox well i agree that she studied pattabhi jois ashtanga yoga sequence with someone and use that for her sequence actually here the sun salutation a and b help to open your body after the body opening her sequence like warm down your body i may try with traditional sun salutation with detox flow lets see how its work anyhow im not going to play this dvd again.
all the songs in my opinion are very cheesey i only like the first song the restare all cheezy.
i am more of a traditional gospel person but as i mature in the lord im able to get pass all of the hiphop and hype of the music and get the message thats being sung i am a big fan of percy grey jr and i think that his helping produce this project is what gave it that taste of chuch overall i say that the project is good and i believe that it will bless the listeners.
i bought this cd in hopes that some of destinys childs songs would get a better beat or become more interesting for dancing what i got was a horrible butchering of emotion a neverending bootylicious a say my name mix anyone would be more than happy to do without and mixes of songs that werent very good the first time around several werent even singles dot nasty girl so goodto make that sound better they throw in independent women pt ii which is taken directly from survivor and hawk a song from michelle williams upcoming solo debut heart to your apr  its sad when the best song on a groups mix cd is one from the member going soloi would not recommend this cd at all if you like destinys child get survivor or writings on the wall if youre looking for good new rb check out ashanti instead.
these lights are not bluei cant even tell that ive changed mine from stock bulbsthere is absolutely no difference herethey dont deserve one starabsolutely do not buy theseits a waste of time and moneycon.
im a relative neophyte to skiing and bought this with the expectation that it might facilitate my learning in my estimation it was pretty much a waste of time and a total waste of money yes it does provide a modicum of instruction but for the most part its suppose to be developing muscle memory by having you watch techniques being repeated ad naseu.
our whole family loved this video it is not only a great introduction to skiing for new skiiers in the family both young and old alike but also gets you excited and ready to hit the slopes come winter for intermediates this is also an excellent review of the basics and some things you might have missed along the way dont miss this one.
i purchased this video for my son who loves them and fell in love with it it is my favorite veggie tale to date a must see it is quite hilarious especially the silly song with larry.
i enjoy a good romance film as much as the next person but this dreadful film is so forced that i could barely sit through it greg kinnear who is usually very good is flat as a pancake along with his irritating costar lauren holly there are a few scattered moments mostly from joan cusack but not not nearly enough to get this awful film off the ground i rate it   stars because i was somehow able to sit through this lazy comedy with no romance to be found.
i made the mistake of seeing this movie in the theater tried hard to get my moneys worth it was impossible the dialog was so contrived and mindless there was not a laugh to be had and the chemistry between kinnear and holly was nonexistent.
i read those positive reviews here and bought this item  years ago it worked pretty well at the beginning starting from about a year ago it couldnt keep the rice moistured for long now it is no better than a  bucks rice cooker and i have to replace it.
we bought this rice cooker because everyone raved about it but no one seems to have mentioned its one huge drawback it takes forever i tried to make two cups of brown rice this evening after  minutes the water was just beginning to boil as a working mom i do not have  hours to make rice every evening yes i suppose i could get in the habit of setting up my rice in the morning and setting the timer but this requires a level of menu commitment i dont presently have or i could go back to our old onebutton cheapo machine that cooked white rice in  minutes brown in  my husband is asian but im not he may like the rice better from this machine but im cooking it and im fed up.
for the price i expected this unit to last longer than my parents bigger and less expensive cooker cant remember the brand of their rice cookereither panasonic or national which theyve used everyday for more than five years now and its still goingmy family didnt use this zojirushi everydaybut we were pretty close after about a year and a half the rice doesnt keep as well as it used to it dries out faster and doesnt cook as evenly as it did while it was under warrantyi noticed most if not all the positive reviews were posted after recent purchases the handful of reviews from folks who have owned and used this item beyond warranty isnt as glowing please keep that in mind if you envision using this rice cooker for years to come.
i was very happy with this rice cooker until the very fragile rubber grommet on the lid tore they do not sell the part beware it is great but it will not last long this feature makes it very very vulnerable i had it for  months before the fragile grommet tore now it no longer makes good rice the cost to repair it makes it useless because i would just have to repair it again in  months this is not a rice maker for anyone who cooks a lot of rice it just wont last.
we bought this  years ago it was very good at the beginning however just after  years of light use it is now toasted the rice comes out sticky and lumpy and drys up in less than  hours we thought zojirushi stands for quality and durability we made a big mistake.
all i can say is that every working healthy and modern kitchen should have a fuzzy logic rice cooker and by buying a good one that will make porrige and has other modes you open it up to providing all kinds of wonderful and creative meals.
i purchased this rice cooker as a christmas gift for my parents i was looking for one that also cooked hot cereals or porridge i read the reviews and decided to give it a try my parents loved it  my mom has alzheimers so my dad does all the cooking he has become an expert at making great yummy hot cereals once my husband tasted the hot cereals he ordered a cooker for us as well the cooker is very easy to clean we are very happy with it ours is made in japan.
the rice turned out perfect very different from other rice cookers i have tried i am worried about what the other reviewers mentioned that the battery could out for the lcd display though since i dont intend to plug the machine in all time.
i was a little confused by reading reviews but i decided on the gofit ball at cm and it worked out just right for my  frame there was no odor from the ball and was not difficult to blow up the ball with the pump provideddid my abdomial exersizes with no proplem with my  lbs of body weighti would recommend this item.
as other reviews band around ball showing the exercises is unnecessary and not nice looking functions well no problem with the pump use it as an alternative desk chair.
it is possible i got a defective ball but i bought this with the intention of using it for px i inflated it following the directions precisely but i found it nearly impossible to perform most of the exercises because the ball compressed so much it is very high quality and was nearly odorless but i highly suggest going for a cheaper ball im now using a tko ball that is more firm.
i read the reviews prior to ordering the color indicated in the photo was purple which i really wanted but i took note that several folks received red i ordered anyway and of course received a red one in spite of not getting a purple ball i still think its a good product heavy duty which was important to me since i need to trust my ball as i too am heavy duty it holds its shape and its volume of air and i feel very comfortable on it im in a stability ball class and have tried the other balls there and like the weight and feel of my red ball ill probably order another smaller one a cm the cm is great for sitting but a little to large for some of the other activities so i think having a pair of different sizes is the way to go.
we have not figured out gow to inflate it fully yet the go fit customer service is open only monday  friday   so we havent used it yet i think i should have just bought it from a local store the instructions are quite poor.
a coworker of mine had ordered this exact ball and i liked it so much i ordered one for myself great value arrived promptly this one is fairly large but i am  so it works great for me shorter folks might want to try one of the smaller ones.
this ball is extremely durable a great size and was easy to inflate for tall people it is excellent the skin is thick and we have had no issues with it and do not feel any danger of it popping.
my husband got this ball as an accessory to a workout program he is using it has served that purpose very well and also our kids love it its pretty big so to them its the ultimate toy im happy its antiburst and i can see us using it for many years it is very quality.
this book contains a myriad of case studies concerning a wide variety of acoustical problems very rich in detail i found it helpful when trying to tackle challenging acoustical problems.
this is very odd in  garth brooks had success when he put out a box set with a similiar theme however for some artists that kind of treatment doesnt work and it falls flat i like toby keith but this box set is just a way for a record company to make money buy repackaging three cds none of which are any good or have any worth and make an extra buck its just sad.
when i bought this box set i expected to recieve compact discs that were fully remastered with  bit technology instead they sound exactly like the original discs i already have while you may find several top quality country hits in this set the sound quality isnt up to snuff for todays standards so now im stuck with doubles of everything and out thrity bucks.
just buy this album dry the rain is the best song ever dogs got a bone is close to being the best ballad ever each song is as original and unexpected as an earthquake push it out feel the beta vibe.
thank goodness for the beta band i must say this album is a real treat for the ears sonically broad lyrically uplifting and overall a good time for all kinda like if graham parsons spliced his genes with beck hanson had a daughter who then married david byrne and had a mess of kids thereby amounting to the beta band musically its that hard to pin them down and thats a good thing definitely an album that can be enjoyed for ages on end the only drawback i felt was the appropriately titled monolith but hey everyone is entitled to their madness.
a great comprehensive guide that helped me to understand why this happened in a historical context also helped me to get a better grasp of what to expect with the war against afghanistan and al qaeda now i know why this happened and what to expect the news media seems to breeze over historical elements in favor of status quo anthrax and millitary events but this book really helped me to get caught up on my facts highly recommended.
in the begining thier was houseand before that thier was salsoul the root of house music started with salsoul this cd captures some of the best songs that they produced to say that this is just another disco cd would be doing it a grave disjustice it would be like calling the mona lisa just a painting or the statue of dave just a rock this is a compilation of the best dance music ever recorded the blend of rebel rosing vocals and smooth lyrical contents with the monstrative rythems are timeless classics my only regret is they didnt release all of thier gems out on one compliation this is a must have for any disco house dance or rb collection.
this was an important book to me when i was a little girl growing up in colorado i couldnt tell you how many times i checked it out of the library to read and reread again i even remember where it was  second shelf from the end three row up reddish hardback coverover the years id forgotten the title i just remembered that it was about a little native american girl who climbed a tree and found another world in the sky after a tedious search of my old towns online library yay for modern internet searches i found a title that rung a bell and won a copy on ebayim so happy to have this book on my shelf now wonderful wonderful story.
i loved this book as a young girl i loved the message about finding your talents and making the most of them even when you are feeling out of place or far from all that is familiar ive been looking for it for my children for years and am so thrilled to have finally found it.
i have purchased several bluetooth headsets in my attempt to obtain a good quality sound i purchased the nextlink ax with the hopes of solving my search i was not impressed it was loud enough as they stated but with the volume turned up it created an echo for the recipient of the call it is a royal pain trying to get the thing in your ear while driving once in it was fine i hung up on several calls while attempting to secure it in my eari have put the whole thing back in the package and will try to return though for the  less shipping both ways it probably isnt worth my timei have gone to the expensive h motorolaas they say you get what you pay for.
my wife thinks this product is identical to the product we found in local stores but at a much lower price per ounce she has been using this product for years.
we hate this thing hate hate hateeven though it is supposed to hold three bikes we cant even get two bikes on it they are so squished togetherevery time we try to use it we just get covered in grease angry and abandon all hope of ever riding bikes somewhere that is not at homefoaming raging hatred.
at first glance this rack seems well designed in fact when i first put it on my car it felt very secure however after  days i noticed that one of the inner arms was loose on closer inspection i realized that the screw that tightens the arm was defective and wouldnt tighten after pulling it out i wasnt surprised because the screw is made of plastic i couldnt believe it the entire rack was total garbage because of one plastic screw the screw is not replaceable with something from your local hardware store either it is a specialty screw with a large cap on it that lets you hand tighten it i cant believe that saris would do this just to save a few bucks this rack went back to amazon and good riddance.
the quality is tenth rate this dvd is almost unwatchable and the audio sucks.
air is a pretty decent show though not quite as good as kanon and clannad that came afterwards adv also gave it a great dub but its not worth buying this set not only does it cram all the episodes onto two discs with funis usually bad av quality as a result but it also strips one of the episodes from the series it may only be a recap episode but its still part of the showthis is not a complete collection and not worth buying.
this novel takes you from a warm fire to the icy wastes and carries you on a wild flight to survive the elements and overcome the threat to innocent travellers a excellent adventure with a unexpected ending.
this is a story with a modicum of drama except for a small dog surprising given the starry nature of the human cast close to nonexistence suspense and muddy sound recording compounded with hard to understand dialog english accents and all that gielguds performance as the hero is mostly one dimensional when you can understand his delivery.
these three discs are a perfect place to begin your stereolab collection as it covers a wide cross section of the stereolab soundand the music just look up the individual disc reviews on amazonits all thereenjoy.
i bought this book thinking this was historical fictioni was wrong this is trash one of the most ridiculous books ive ever read he doesnt know squat and his characters are ludicrous badly written and boring.
this movie is very enjoyable and handles the topic of adolescent obesity and eating disorders very tactfully could be shown in high school health classes.
i like feinsteins work but this book is a bore the first  pages are minibiographies of usga staff someone out there must find interesting which college basketball team is the favorite of the usga publicity director but i am at loss to understand whom.
feinstein takes a different tack in the open versus his previous golf books a good walk spoiled and the majors instead of stories about the players on the tour this story focuses on the people behind the transformation of the wornout municipal golf course bethpage black into the great course that hosted the  us open championship i found i couldnt stop reading as feinsteins prose is once again funny heartwarming and flowing my only critique is that i wished for more detail on rees jones changes to ag tillinghasts design with illustrations for a book about the transformation of the golf course there isnt enough about the physical changes that were done the book does a great job portraying the enormity of the project that was undertaken so the satisfaction that is felt with the success of the championship seems to be well deserved.
the subtitle should be inside the portojohns at bethpage black because feinstein devotes many pages to the man who set up all those portable toilets that lined the golf course every last one even one that tiger briefly did some business in the guy who unloaded the portojohns off the truck is interesting for about a clause but we get page after page of this guy youd think he was the pope of bethpage black if you want to know fascinating stuff like the precise number of portojohns that actually lined the golf course then attempt to burrow your way through open the playing of golf  im talking about the first actual golf shot of the tournament  doesnt make its first appearance until page  at that point the book is more than twothirds overfeinstein phoned this one in did someone edit this he should have called it a good open spoiled dont waste your money.
dvd was in excellent condition brand new the film is very good well made very good visuals to go with the story telling however this is a short version of the original film that is the only negative of this production.
if you read it through and through you will find how wonderful it is to approach calculus in a graphical numerical and symbolic way if you want to challenge your mind in this way this book is probably the most suitable for you i am using it in my calculus calss and i found the concepts are very clearly explained the thing that i love most of this book is that it helps students develop a good understanding of calculus through observing and studying the graphs of the functions this only imperfection of the book if any is that there lack of some theoretical exercises but any book can not be perfect the most important thing is how you enjoy it for me it is a new and fresh guide of the study of calculus.
i am a fan of traditional theoremproof exposition and this ostebeezorn text demonstrates why this book attempts to make calculus easy to understand but the only result is that it is impossible to follow essential concepts are buried deep within piles of verbiage and the examples skip important steps making them hard to follow add to that the large number of typos and errors in the solutions manual as a teaching assistant i have had strong mathematics students who could not understand this book and whose knowledge of calculus suffered as a result with so many quality calculus textbooks on the market it is hard to understand why a school would choose to use this unsuccessful experiment.
i wouldnt recommend this booki believe that roth is too involved in the characters having sex than trying to get some sort of plot goingi didnt enjoy reading goodbye columbus but i did enjoy reading the short stories where it is not about sex but rather about religion thank you for the short stories.
note for parents what was nickolodeon thinking spongebob and patrick stuff themselves with sundaes then behave like drunksdown to the staggering about talking with slurred speech and suffering from a hangover the next morning on an unshaven blearyeyed spongebob the scene could have easily been played with stomachachesalso the movie features patrick in black fishnet hose and stiletto heels i kid you notmy sons fans of spongebob on tv rarely laughed and pronounced it sorta ok we all wished wed seen someting else the story was contrived and not even cleverwatch the show dont bother seeing the movie.
what the fk is this the tv show was funnier than this garbage people who doesnt have seen this movie dont see it its a yasste of time and money.
i loved this movie its about sponge bob and patrick going to shell city to get king neptunes crown and while sb and p are going to shell city plankton takes over the world its a great movie see it.
this is just pethetic i dont get the point of watching the movie there was abot hmm  funny parts that dont even go with the movie even my dad fell asleep in the movie i shouldnt even tell you the stroy its so stupid dont buy this movie when it comes out if you buy i hope you enjoy being bored.
ive built three computers for family using this case and they all love it a bit wider than the sandard case but about half the height glossy black piano finish it only appears cramped if you fail to plan i use modular ps and tie down all the cords getting ready to buy another.
out of all the shopping i have done through amazon this is the only thing i will be returning the book only measures   x   has very small print and obscure black and white illustrations at the beginning of each chapter in the same order i received james herriots treasury for children which for the same price is absolutely beautiful and what i also expected from this book.
james herriots dog stories is written by a man who loves both people and animals the descriptions of people dogs and his humble view of himself are an irresistable combination the accuracy and wit with which he presents peoples relationships with their dogs is priceless when i read this book i laugh at the eternal goofiness of dogs and also dog people the sadder stories are written with a balanced view this book is an amazing collection of short stories highly recommended.
it is hard to believe that this is no longer available new on amazon i think this is a great cd with jazz and bluegrass all mixed together if you want to call it progressive that works too anyway it is great music buy it.
it is simply not worth wasting your money even on songs of the sixties so fine as these since the sound qualities of this disc are so poor as to completely ruin the listening experience i used to have this on vinyl lp and should have kept it the sound was great back then the cd is nothing but scratches and hisses disgraceful.
this shirt is great by itself under an cotton shirt under sholder pads and even under a coldgear shirt the coldgear feels almost like crushed velvet and i like it usually but everyonce in a while it gets to me and i have to put on my turf gear underneath it this a must have for your under armour wardrobe.
i tried this product when they used to sell it at walgreens as soon as i fell in love with it they stopped selling it i cant seem to find a place anywhere who sells it its pain free and works really really well for something that looks like a sticker i dont even get my eyebrows professionally done i use these shapers above my brow and tweeze underneath they make my eyebrows look perfect.
short remains steadfast wthis release production varies even e sermon drops by wa dope beat for short to spit to if youre a fan you will not be dissapointed his lyrical pimp hand remains strong throughout the duration of the record add it to your collection peace.
my  year old son wanted this so bad but when we got it for him there were so many pieces to put together that didnt fit together well he never played with it it just sits on our floor in many pieces taking up toy space what a waste.
remember  dont play your rockn roll to me  from smokie no the gallaghers gave a f on that they did what they can give but this one was not to the hand of god the following album after this was going on jesus christ way.
nebula awards showcase  is another collection of stories that you read and dont forget immediately another greatdealtreasure through amazon.
this book was suggested reading as if  the great secret to personal freedom was going to be revealed it spoke of a selfcentered mindset that seemed to suggest that i was to live my life how i wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me a very simplistic and selfish point of view.
i have had the case for a month now and i am very happy with it so far the case holds my tx nicely no problems with the belt clip either very good product for the price.
i love this case it is very hard to keep my palm protected i carry my palm in my pocket everyday at work befor this case sometimes my lab jacket would get caught in the car door and the door would get slamed on my palm this case prevents any damage i love it.
i liked soulbait alittle better than this but blaze is still good i like the futuristic effects on the songs and how they designed the album cover.
this is truthfully worthless books i had counted at least  typos on this book i also do not like the double space to make this book look volumnious which it is not it is basically a flyer which is printed in the form of a book the litigation only contains new york and that is too outmoded truthfully it was a waste of time and money to buy this book it creates the impression that the doors to a very secretive knowledge would be open to you but the knowledge given in this book is very basic which i am sure any reader worth their salt attempting to venture into this territory might already knows truthfully i was disappointed to read this book.
as a banker one never wants to have to be in the position of collecting bad debts mr lewis has done a great job describing the process  a terrific reference for anyone who needs an experienced perspective on the process.
this budding romance is a bitslow i was a bit disappointed with the story line but then again i find it quite difficult for asians to do a well coming out or coming of age story this is my opinion i would reccomend that you save your money and not view it.
wow i was hoping this game wouldnt be as bad as people said it really sucks no fun at all pretty to look at on my pbut thats it funfactor   glad i only paid  for it in a nutshell if youre under  yrs old you will love this game if not spit on it what a waste.
i tried this cream and now have to go to a dermatologist because of a skin reaction the only positive feedback comes from a feedback pro dont believe meread the other reviews they have left buyer bewareany company that has to pay someone to write their reviews needs to put out a better product so real reviews can be written.
i bought the drawing  painting fantasy beasts and the fantasy figures books for our high school library the kids really enjoy them and so do i i just signed on to see what else might be in this series and to order more copies while these books may not appeal to everyone not enough stepbystep for true beginners the layout and abundance of good pictures and ideas will grab most readers and artists.
barry corbin ends up with a korean family that he never knew he had he is gruff and not accepting of his visitors not even friendly but soon mellows during the christmas season the usual characters are here  a wonderful series that should have lasted longer this chapter is just another example of great acting and terrific writing i enjoyed the old vhs and it arrived in perfect shape wonderful family entertainment.
normally i am the kind of person who goes for books with adventure and fantasy in them but hey i tried this one out and loved it its not as fast paced as some of the books ive read but that suprisingly didnt matter i suggest anyone read it.
i am in college now and i had to take a test on this book when i was i the seventh grade at that time i hated the book i thought it was even more nast than jhonny tremain i just wanted to make a mast on that book it was so boring i just fell asleep i would not reccomend this book to anyone and i would tell someone to read the future of us instead i just fealt like making a nast in this book and putting it away so when the next person like justice reads it they would see my nast and think the book was nast what a disappointment.
this book is about some girl from barbados named kit tyler who has to move to wethersfield connecticut first of all the characters are the most boring people in the world the plot stinks there barely is a plot i like books where there is a lot of action and the story mountain has bumps along the way this book there is no mountain and they just go on flat ground just to let you know im being metaphoric here and then go up a little hill the only reason i actually gave this book a star is because the witch trials and where kit is running away is kind of suspenseful just dont read this book it isnt good.
this book was ok to me it dragged on quite a bit but i really liked the ending i didnt like how it would talk about the same thing for over  chapters it just felt like it wasnt my kind of book however i liked the last part the last  chapters were probably that only part i liked.
after purchasing this for our home library i couldnt wait to read it before my children did i was bored and unenthused throughout the reading the author made great attempts at historical accuracy just not enough with character or plot development the story must have been born of facts first as the characters just seemed thrown about and inconsistent along with the lack of plot those inconsistencies are what make this a brutal read i cant imagine either of my young avid readers enjoying this book and all its predictabilities.
i think this book was boring the only exciting part is the witch hunt most of the time they talked about polatics if they wernt the were cring over petty grevences such as love this is why this story was boring the characters were annoying and obtuse it was hard reading such a disgusting piece of lititure kit was such an unintelligent and snooty creature it was infurating to read about the women were either selfcentered or meek the thought about love all the time the men disscussed politics like a change would end the world and the men thought women were dirt nat and the cat were the only intellegent creatures the characthers are just lacking perwsonality and intellegence.
i have read this book several times since i was a preteen its like visiting an old friend each time i love it one of my all time favorites.
the witch of blackbird pond is a good book it is about the early american settlers the puritans and their witch trials kit has recently moved to america from a barbadoes after her fathers death what she finds there are strict religious rules pious settlers and bad fashion but she takes refuge in the company of hannah who is called evil because she is a quaker when hannah is acused of casting sickness on the town and escapes the town acuses kit in the end kit must learn to change her attitude and the town must learn to conquer religious differences.
this book was semi interesting i liked certain parts but compared to other books this one was too predictible i prefered the book beyond the burning time not only was it better it was less predictable and more interesting but read the two books for yourself and you can decide.
this book was an overall  star book the quality of the dialogue was horrible because it was very unrealistic this book was also very boring and drawn out because it did not have a lot of action the characters however were very interesting and original the events were very boring and predictable.
this book was a wonderfully light and entertaining read kit is a young girl who is forced to leave her island home of barbados in the late s and live with a strict puritan community in connecticut she has many new relationships some good and some bad in this land where life seems so harsh one of her special relationships is with an elderly quaker woman the witch of blackbird pond the author is detailed in showing early new england life the characters are a charming and i will always remember hannah tupper a fabulous book for adults young and old.
when we purchased a new sofa that has a recliner on each end we needed a table to sit in front of the middle seat when its just the two of us one that we could reach items from either recliner this table has beautiful smooth woo.
this book gives some good advice on the essay but an awful lot of the book is not related how to put together your best essay i bought this after the book a is for admission recommended it i had much higher expectations for it because of that.
they have that unmistakable beet like their fathers which is always good to hear but they have managed to do create a new style whch is what makes this one mortal as soon as i saw them do one of their songs on tv i went out to buy it i wasnt disappointed it is extremely danceable i also love the name and what it means.
one of the best albumsever any genre any era my god what a knock out this is the latest musical persona of will oldham whose illustrious career began as palacepalace musicpalace brothers and many say its his greatest achievement yet i knew within ten seconds of first hearing this record that it had to be true every song reaches in and squeezes the heart gets all tangled up in your insides you know whats great about this record every single haunting track is memorable and affecting every one there isnt a single track that fades into the backgroundand that is a rare treat these days and the fact that a tune as staggeringly vibrant as a minor place can coexist so easily with smothering odes like i see a darkness is just amazing it is in many ways like life.
i am trying to be frugal with my five star reviews but this album deserves full marks without question judging by my screen name one can safely assume that i am a will oldham fan i myself not being much of a writer will avoid trying to pin this album down with my words but direct those interested to reviews at both pitchforkmediacom and nmecom.
it is my girls first year in ballet so i just wanted an inexpensive bag if you want a really nice bag dont waste your money here the entire bag is made of urethane and has a cheap feel the biggest positives are the cute graphics and the straps work well.

if you like good music dont waste  bucks may the record stand i didnt want this cd my sister bought it for me their anoying voices and pathetic melodies are well annoying and pathetic no good will come of buying this spend your money on a good cd like everclear or fastball.
i could hardly stand to listen to this cd for more than five minutesit was so depressing and all the songs practically sounded the sameget whats the story morning gloryit rocks.
i am a oasis fan and to be honest be here now isnt very good  the only good songs are dyou know what i mean  magic pie  stand by me and all around the world which is too long   its no where near as good as the others and isnt worth the money.
this is a poor attempt at a follow up to morning glory i wouldnt say its terrible but i wouldnt buy it again if given the choice which is a shame really because their first two were quite good.
i dont have to hear only new music all the time but i must say that oasis be here now is one album id just as soon forget forever if whats the story morning glory defined and popularized britpop be here now sounded its death knell i will admit that the sound is much like older oasis recordings but thats just the problem its too much like the older stuff and sounds suspiciously like the gallaghers were in a hurry to turn out something  anything  asap what makes this album so bad is that it was hyped so much which left this oasis fan with a sharp sense of being taken for a ride oasis may be the most popular british band but they arent the best much british talent goes unnoticed overseas ie silver sun the dandys shed seven catatonia northern uproar and thats a shame save your money for something more original than be here now.
i loved oasis first us album whats the story morning glory and this was a wonderful followup the music is crisp fresh and has catchy melodies that keep you listening i love oasis and i love this cd.
be here now does have its moments dyou know what i mean my big mouth stand by me and dont go away along with a few lesser tracks all around the world and its getting better man and a true dog magic pie but its just another example of what happens when youre worth  the cocaine supply is neverending noel gallagher has admitted this and stopped using and you ask how long a cd is  minutes and you say well lets fill the expletive upthe production is awful knobsup full stop layers and layers of squalling guitars all hints of subtleness are gone except for the end part of dont go away the band still rocks out but the sound is harshi almost gave it three stars because of the decent songs on here but ive got to deduct one star for the phil spector with hearing damage style of production sorry guys find a better producer next time out.
the songs in this album are quite boring only a few good ones i wouldnt recommend it get their previous albums instead.
i like oasis because their songs are rhythmic and i like the lead singers voice all of their songs have a different rhythmic and all songs are really good there are  songs on this album i like the th song  stand by me  because its really nice when they say  stand by me nobody knows the way its gonna be  i like these parts and the th song  dont go away  is good  too i found this song is for when something sad has happened to yo.
these album is their best work yet the songs are an interesting conbination of the songs from the albums they did before the songs has the basic things from the first record and the elegancy and sofistication of what the story morning glory as well you will hear more details in these onethese is the band of the sand they will be the band of the s of course so buy it now noel is a tired and true music god.
why do yankees always put oasis down eh they are the greatest band ever i live in the same city as they did and im listening to their music  people just get jealous of their success if anyone agrees or disagrees email me instantly.
this plane takes alot to get off the ground you really have to throw this thing but once its up there your good to go i would recommend to stand on top of hill and throw it so it has more of a chance getting airborne.
when i purchased this cd i did not know what to expect i have been a billy joel fan for my whole life i was very surprised during the first listen even though it sounded something like frank sinatra would write it still has the billy joel feel both with the music and timing as this fan grows older this is a welcome sound i hope there is more to come joseph leonardi.
like eragoni first watched the movie and really enjoyed it afterwards i read the book and realized that the movie was horribly done when compared to the booki liked all of the character building in the book and thought it had plenty of humor and action there was no sex and cussing that i remember in the book for those that dont like to read that sort of stuffon a side notemy inner immaturity laughed when the words fagged and ejaculated were used to describe feelings and expressionsfive stars.
this book was really fun it was actionpacked the beginning was a little odd at least to me but the rest of the story kept me interestedsince its an older story its really great for adults like me who love oldschool scifi my son wasnt grabbed by it by the way so not sure if its great for kids.
the gadget by paul zindel is about a thirteen year old stephen orr his father is a scientist that works for the goverment in the time period of the s if you are person who likes history and science this book is perfect stephen is a person who i can relate to becasue i know a person just like him matt hadsell they both like to explore the unknow and discover the undiceded as my title says too good thats exactly what this book is so if you like reading or just want an intersting read the gadget is right for you.

ive been using the carafe for  months and generally speaking a pleasure to use its decently constructed though by no means heavy duty and its lasted so far even though im not gentle on thingsmy only real complain is that because the carafe narrows at the top and its rather tall its hard to clean the bottom without a brush.
given as a gift today to go with recipients coffee makerthey used it for their guests same day  and really likedappreciated the size and quality of the pitcher its a perfectsize to give you the option of quantity to make.
this book is very good the story line is fantastic and i cannot put it down there is one problem however this book was very poorly proofread if proofread at all there are many grammatical mistakes and other errors that middle school students could eliminate if they had read their work nonetheless i highly recommend the fall of reach and the rest of the series as long as you are able to overlook certain imperfections.
growing up in a military family makes me like the style of these books all the more they pull you into the halo universe and you immediately become attached to the characters great stories and insight into the award winning game halo after reading it i wanted to play some halo and kick some covenant rear.
im almost finished with the fall of reach and while i love the story the editors need to be shot wherever there is a word that has the letters f and i together theyre missin.
now i am a huge fan of jack off jill my ruin otep ect and those chicks can scream however the vocalist of sugarcoma fails to make the music enjoyable with her weak screaming the singers oj joj mr otep ect put power behing their music and make it enjoyable sugarcoma just makes it annoying she does have a nice singing voice and the band is very talented i think sugarcoma would be better off if she didnt scream.

this book was not what i expected the author spends much valuable time describing his personal trials and tribulations with the russian system rather than explaining the what how where and gory details of biological warfare if you are looking for an exciting read pass on this onei did read the whole thing and i can guarantee it will put you to sleep every time you pick it up.
if you can get past the cover and inside photos  a humper who looks suspiciously surgically streamlined  you will be for a warm fuzzy surprise the humper still has it smooth vocals with a blend of country and pop and the softest of rock possible all showcased with his threeandahalf octave range there are covers  volare penny lane perhaps an homage to the beatles the group whom he knocked off the charts with his no  hit release me if tomorrow never comes this guys in love with you and the underrated aznavour anthem she theres an infectious taste of calypso with brazil and a truly likable countryflavored  how slow we go cowritten by the humpers daughter louise the best track is the title track definition of love  proof indeed that the man still defines love now a bad way to celebrate  years in the business of making love on the record.
i enjoyed the book for the most part and learned some things however he seemed to repeat the information a lot guess repetition is the key to memory it was to a point that annoyed me though then again repetition annoys me period lol also somethings kinda contradicted themselves but for the most part it was a pretty decent book and i did learn some things and def recommend this vs regular running relying on super thick soles praying the shoe will protect you which will give you more injuries later down the road.
i read chirunning in sep  it took me  wks to get the form right while running ive been chirunning sinceits not effortless  my heart rate meter tells me so  though it does feel effortless for a whole minute or two doing medium sprints i now run x a week an hour or two each time this is something id never been able to do in the past because my knees always started giving problems and id have to train on an elliptical afterwards the knees are fine now im sure danny wouldnt recommend it but you can even run on a bad knee with this technique  i ran k on a poor knee without much loss of speedmy timing has also improved though not as much as id hoped or expected hence  starsenjoy running you should give it a go.
i checked this book out from my local la leche league im surprised they still have this book available being nearly twenty years old maybe some of my problems are with it being outdated however my main gripe is that it is very condescending and judgmental instead of just informing you on different options none of which would work for me and only one or so that would apply well to a full time job this book presents a certain ideal and if the job arrangements do not fit that ideal theyre not good arrangements and you arent a good mother if you want helpful nonopinionated advice this is not the book for you currently im reading the working mothers guide to life which seems much more friendly and helpful.
i dont get this cd i listened to it listened to it again chased my cat cheeseyfranks with a salisbury steak tv dinner listened to it again and nope nothing its more average rock by bands that mark knopfler should put over his knee and whoop with a copy of procol harums las vegas comeback effort its junk kroll was all about sparta about  months ago before a telemarketer talked him into some psychic network he now tells me that my oatmeal may jump up and start singing showtunes if my aura is not in line anyway sparta is a waste of time only saved by the bell the pre school years can compete with.
a fast read has some helpful teaching points and very general commentary on japanese society seems a bit outdated too at least my  edition does a lot of time spent covering things you could easily look up on the web if you are going to japan through jet you will have heard a lot of this stuff by the time you get to japan definitely check this out in a bookstore before buying probably give it a pass.
mariah and whitney are together with celine dion and aretha franklin the greatest singers alive they really show their voices power in this song and they made a wonderful job together well done girls well done.
for all the famous names in this movie soomething better should have come out of it it was predictable from the first and the twists and turns were just silly they couldnt leave the estate although one of them managed to arrive from the outside just about every one was involved in something illicit or at least in something strange lovers were talked about but not really discussed the biggest bombshell involving supposed incest was discussed by just two of the eight and nothing was made of it this movie was just an unrelated bunch of snippets that just doesnt work.
during a snowstorm eight women are stranded in a french country home with the corpse of the murdered family patriarch slightly bizarre lowkey french film pokes fun at the comedy murder mystery genre while heralding the feminine mystique of domesticity and dominance it has the added distinction of breaking into song from each of the eight principal players a strangely satisfying technique that often delivers touching portraits of womankind this is as intoxicating as a glass of fine french wine.
zorba the greek is a novel that has inspired me since i was a child alexis is a man that has this atomic reactor in his body that he cannot control the coal mine owner his boss starts to realize little by little what zorba is all about despite that his worker is not educated he learns a lot about life from him this kind of novel is the one you do not forget and in my case is present for many situations zorba is never let down by failure or tragedy take your shoes off and dance to the rhytm of life .
i wouldnt go so far as to call it brilliant zorba is a refreshing and likeable character but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy his dialogue a bit overly pedantic the story to me felt a bit too long and choppy with not much of a plot but there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest like i said not a brilliant book but pretty good nonetheless.
this was the worst pair of headphones ive ever bought and it was not easy to get the local bose store to give me a full refund on them despite their advertised no hassle refund policyterrible sound poor ergonomics medicore noise cancellationnever again will i buy another bose product i shouldve known better my husband has a ridiculous bose wave radio which he now tells everyone that he won at a christmas raffle at the office because hes too embarassed to confess that he paid half a grand for the thingmy son pointed me towards a pair of sennheisers which were better in every respect and at one third of the price.
i use these for blocking out noise at the office and then take them home for gaming they are very versatile and the sound quality is very good they do a great job of blocking out external noise that dog barking that guy in the next cubical that has to yell into his phone or that guy that has to smack his lips when hes chewing gum sometimes its just enough to put them on flip the power switch and relax without actually hooking them up to listen to something i am very comfortable wearing them from am to pm while it would be nice if my ears had a little more ventilation but that would defeat the purpose of the noise canceling.
paid  for these about  years ago after about  years of light use the ear pad vinyl fell apart and the head bar rubber padding became very sticky comes off on your fingers and gets on everything the replacement ear pads dont fit into the frame well and come out easily the overall quality of sound and durability was very disappointing i found several overtheear clip ear phones for under  to be superior in every way including comfort quality stereo and i can use these cheaper ear phones when im sweatingexercising dont try that with the bose headphones the bose headphones didnt really cancel ambient noise i dont use them anymore.
ive owned my pair for close to four years now and they are starting to physically deteriorate the sound quality is excellent as is the noise canceling i used these in an office cubicle environment and later in a computer room and the performance on my ipod is outstanding but at this point the plastic upright on each earphone has broken and needs to be held together with wire ties and the rubber cover on one of the ear pieces has worn through granted i use them almost every day but they dont see rough use  and this isnt the type of endurance id expect from a  product the two year warranty isnt long enough to address these issuesupdated january one of the ear pieces finally cracked at the pivot point and simply fell off when i contacted boise they did offer to replace them with a new set for .
i purchased a new backgammon set and it arrived in perfect condition the only problem i had was the black pieces they were somehow discolored on every one this problem was not present on the white everytime i play it the black pieces bother me i would like instructions on getting another set of black pieces i feel that i should not have to pay since this set was not cheap please advisethanksgary h.
would i recommend it yes but try to get it used also i would definitely buy their next in hopes that they may find themselves with a more well defined sound you catch a bit of a sense that they are trying to be the beastie boys on another level they need to just try to be quarashi but they clearly arent entirely sure who that is the first track is by far the best on the album in my opinion it absolutely rocks but the rest of it doesnt have the teeth that track does if you like this first track dont buy the whole album for it the entire album is only  minutes.
i think it was a very good book especially if you are interested in indian crafts or building a bow and arrow.
im a professional chef and a big fan of german knives i like a heavier knife in my hand that i know will do the job all day long that i want it to this set is amazing and i use it every day grante.
if you are ready for a stark unrelenting description of life in the ghetto auschwitz and dachau this book doesnt let up for one sentence amazing story and written in a way that is poetic but easy to read the book is classified as fiction but it is really a memoir with names changed there is no way anyone could make this up.
im ok with paying for ebooks i bought this one but was so distracted by multiple scaninduced typographical artifacts that i requested and received a refund about twothirds of the way through the book free ebooks force me to tolerate some typos as those books are done by volunteers and not for profit but an  kindle book sold by amazon should be free of such nuisances this one wasnt and im basing this review solely on the poor quality of the ebook itself not the content or theme of this book its a shame to hype the kindle format while simultaneously selling a substandard version of that very format.
maybe it was because i didnt know the story of cupid and psyche before i read the book but i was not overly moved by this book i especially did not enjoy part ii when i just kept wondering what the heck is going on thank goodness that lewis included the summary of the traditional myth at the end it might be helpful to read this part first.
i love this groups early feelgood canadian rock n roll but i stumbled onto this album in a music store in the mall with excitement i sampled all the songs and to my disappointment i still cant figure out what the hit was suppose to be its really terrible so dont bother just stick to their old stuff their s stuff rocks.
if you appreciate the finer aspects of life in rural southern states you need to buy this dvd for a good laug.
christian bale is great as bruce wayne and the rest of the crewliam neesonmichael cainegary oldmanmorgan freeman make this film the best batman movie yetthe director takes a different course than previous filmsbatman begins is dark and sinisterwe see why bruce wayne turned to crime fightingthe film is chock full of suspenseaction and high tech gadgetsthe hd dvd version is a flawless transfer and a worthy addition to your collection.
best batman series this is a great start to a fantastic story line this gives great detail to the development of the character who becomes the dark knight a must see film and must see series.
if you are a batman fan this is the movie to see we start at bruce waynes beginnings and travel with him as he trains to become the dark knightthe script was approved by dc comics and therefore holds more truth to the original story than the batman movies before it christian bale was a really great casting choice as he has the duality to play both the suave bruce wayne and the haunted batman micheal caine liam neeson and morgan freeman played their characters with the great skill that weve come to expect from these legendary actors cillian murphys portrayal of dr jonathan crane was amazing and complex i look forward to the next movie in this remarkable new series.
i have all the batman series of movies and am a comic book fan from way back i wanted the new take on the character the movie doesnt disappoint it goes back and gives a new look at the beginning of the man becoming the character the cast is well developed as the story progresses and it is a joy to watch the film this is a more serious batman than some of the other incarntions the action is fast and cast is great i will enjoy this movie over and over.
 it took for ever to get started the whole bring the same fear to your enemies was annoyingthere was a classic batman bad guyno batmobilethe plot was good except the st half and the special were good could have been a lot better.
as a long time batman fan i do use a batman comforter i think that this batman movie is the best of the lot while all are fun this one seemed to capture the dark charm of batman so much better then the others you get to see bruce wayne before batman and really see that batman over any other superhero is really just a man trying to make the world a safer place now that ive got that out of my system let me just say that christian bale was great the whole movie had fantastic casting katie holmes wasnt very believable as a strong district atorney and really didnt hold up that well against bale on the screen i believe that the moive is interesting enough that even people who are watching the movie simply because it is batman will love it too.
i rented this movie because i was catching up on the trilogy preparing for dark knight rises this movie was awesome was really sets up for the next movies along with the other two this movie is a must plus because i didnt own the dvd amazon was a fantastic alterative with superb streaming quality.
i actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit but it may be a touch overrated adequate if not good performances by all members of the cast especially christian bale who comes across as interesting charismatic and likeable the imagery may have been a bit run of the mill compared to a tim burton rendering nonetheless the batman franchise seems to still be alive and well with this latest edition author ofadjust your brain a practical theory for maximizing mental health.
i know you recent movie goers have just come out of the theatre recently i did too were charged up but dont get out of control get a batgrip on yourself the best batman movie was the  tim burton original batman returns comes next and batman begins is somewhere around there the schumacher oneswhile not being superb still have their momentsthe batsuit did make bale look sometimes like fatman the batarangs were rusty looking and not cool enough i like the action sequences and how the story circled on fear the early training stuff seemed to go a little too fastall in all batman begins is a good movie i just think people need to think twice before they label bale better than keaton heeeelll noo o.
batman begins is the best movie of christine bale stares in this movie and hedid a wonderful job doing itthis movie is about how bruce wayne turns to batmanhe trains to be a ninja in asia and then founds that gotham city is flooded over with crimanelsso bruce wayne has to turn into batman to kill his very first villan the scarcrow who could destroy poeples minds into panikthis movie is awsome.
very entertaining good quality bluray for the theatrical version have not yet explored the special features.
im not sure why this movie has gotten good reviews it was not good the dialog was awful the plot ridiculous we have to destroy it in order to save it i wish liam would stop taking on mentor rolesthe final scene was physically impossible swinging under the train as it was moving just ask yourself how he swung past the pylons that held the rail up.
batman begins was such a relief for batman fans finally we have a movie that is worth braggin about and has taken the franchise in a great new direction this one is definitely the nd best batman movie to date and i say that because the dark knight was just so damn good even if youre not a superhero movie fan youll like this one this takes away the supernaturalsuperhero aspects of other comic movies and turns it more realistic highly recommend.
it contains a lot of action however it does not appeal to me the acting is not engaging i dont feel related to the plot i prefer spiderman .
i saw this movie this past summer its a good movie its better than other two batman movies batman forever and batman and robin this movie got something right as far the comic goes thejoker did nt kill bruce pranets keaton did a better job as batman mr bale played a good batman this movie has minor actor in it a good saga review .
i also do not know why they bothered with this limited edition gift set the extra disk does nothing except waste your time.
it was a gift for my nephew for christmas it came in great shape and even included a comic book.
christan bale as a young bruce waynebatman is a much needed reinvention of the batman movie franchise he has amazing screen presence and makes you believe that he is the dark knight i was impressed how naturally he jumped into the role and made it his ownthe story is tight and easy to follow the cinematography is beautiful especially the parts filmed in iceland big sweeping shots of snow covered mountains and raggedy buildings lining the slopes just fabulousthe  disc dvd set is spectacular the video transfer is almost perfect and there are plenty of extras for the rabid batman fan the compilation comic book is a very nice addition i would recommend this set to anybody.
my  year old son received this toy as a gift although he somewhat enjoys playing with it i was seriously disappointed with the functionality of the click bricksfirst the click bricks dont stick together well if you pick up two joined sections or try to reposition them they fall apart  very frustrating for a  year old i think the magnets are way too weak some of the magnets dont work at allsecond you cant really build much of anything with the pieces in this set they have some neat pictures of built projects on the box but good luck recreating themi would absolutely not recommend this toy my son has much more fun playing with his mega blocks and with his basic wooden alphabet blocks hope this review is helpful to you.
i bought this toy for my son for christmas i had bought some of the trucks and wanted him to have bob and wendy too i found this set and thought it would be great they only good thing about this set is that he has bob and wendythe clicking blocks sound like a great concept but they dont work if you can get them to click you are lucky you can not build anything with this set the box shows a house buildings etc but you cant build these thing because the magnets are in the wrong places and the roofs make the whole thing top heavyi would avoid this set unless you just really need bob and wendy like us.
ive had this windshield mount for a few months now and while it works i cant really say that i would recommend it to anyone elseas the other review said it shakes quite a bit while driving however that is bearable compared to the real problemthe pivot head is just not very sturdy hitting the smallest bumps on the road or even just turning could cause the pivot head to swivel leaving your psp in a slanted positionthe pivot head swivels while driving whether or not i have the psp docked in the windshield mount so its not an issue of weight i end up having to adjust its position every few minutes which is not exactly the safest thing to have to do while driving.
firstly i found this cream to have an odd smell to it secondly it moisturizes well but not as well as i had anticipated and hopedthis product was disappointing and i do not plan on repurchasing there are other products from neostrata that i love but this definitely is not one of them.
i really like this album and i think the intent of the musician is somewhat more involved than the lyrics would have you believe i think he is railing against the church and how it has distorted and destroyed whatever purity there was about the early christian movementmusically the horror film samples work well next to the distorted vocals the synths sound fantastic and the percussion has a nice amount of grainy distortion added so that the tracks are rarely boring if at all  they pound scream and soar through the average sonic boundaryi agree with virus mags review in that this album is not the most original thing out there but the concept of the album is interesting and keeps it all pieced together theres nothing bad about this album per se but nothing really grabs my attention as being too exciting in terms of originalitynevertheless a good album for fans of dark electroindustrialterror ebm.
gofit vest great to work with regarding ease of putting it on and especially the velco straps to hold it together we use it in spiking and agility drills for volleyball it still allows the arm and shoulder to be used effectively and we really like the weight distributed in the front rather than on the shoulders or back highly recommend.
i really like this productive been using it for walking the bridges and the parks and have just started using it for joggingand i have seen results alreadyits funny too when you take it off it feels like you instantly lost  lbsthe only thing is that its kinda bulky so you really cant wear it under clothes you just have to grin and wear itat first i felt silly but who cares im doing this for me and i feel better already.
this was a really good investment i use it during some of my aerobic exercise dvds and i walkjogrun with it on the only negative is that you cant wear it on the outside of your clothing because it looks like a bulletproof vest and then there are a lot of eyes staring at you so i decided to wear it under my clothing it is a little bulky but it isnt so bad i highly recommend it for someone who is new to to the vest it is economical and it will serve the purpose of helping togofit pound walking vest with removable water bottle holdershed those pounds.
this vest was just as described and the fit was great it has wide shoulders so the comfort is good since i had never used a walking vest i wanted to start out as recommended with lighter than  pounds so removed some of the weights these were not so easy to get out of the pouches but that means they are securely held in place i am well pleased with this gofit walking vest.
these are very pretty but i did not use them on my tree since they look more hot pink than red in a few years as i add more colors to my tree i will have them.
i love bodysense productsthey stay hot for a long time i use them in my massage practice as hot packs the smell is great and it lasts quite awhile the only thing is as large as it is you need a big microwave to heat it i wind up folding it then it stops roatating so i have to stop and adjust it ugh it is a pain havent figured out how to arrange so it heats evenly otherwise i love it.
i was hesitant to buy this for my new macbook pro but im glad i did i took a little getting used to but it fits very well over the keys with minimal typing interference its not completely transparent so it does cloud the key symbols a little bit but not enough to make them unreadable in normal light or when the backlighting is on i dont have any problems with it sticking to the screen i have the regular not glossy screen when the cover is closed this is cheap insurance for your computer liquid spills into the keyboard of a laptop computer are a disaster the repair will be very expensive and will not be covered under warranty.
this little slipcover for my keyboard has saved the day for our family i feel safe leaving my  year old alone with his drinks watching my laptop now that he understands to keep the keyboard protector on really frees me up and helps me not worry about him ruining my computer so much anymore it would be even better if the edges were sticky enough to hold the cover on more securely but as is gives me much peace of mind i think everyone should have one of these.
yes my friends of this great indstry this is one of theworlds finest albums of the decade  for so long metalhas been classified in a devilish class of its own but to bringlight in this world of maddness this group does indeed bringspiritual healing in there heavenly dark sound this groupdoes not exist anymore so anything that you buy of this bandis a collectors piece dont delay on the purchase of this foryou will miss out on a treat if you are in to dark and evilsounds but do go to church you need to get this gift fromgod for this is your album filled with the truth if you arethe other guy still dont miss out on some good musicbig nutt.
got these to put in my camper great for a low watt system i am surprised at the bass response in these little speakers i wouldnt put them in a high power system they are rated at  watt but for a low watt system they sound very good and look great too.
i was disappointed in this book i am searching for a book that is equally as awesome as a virtuous woman but it looks like kaye gibbons isnt going to give it to us in this book the women are survivors because they have to be i was disappointed in the cold compassionless character of charlie kate her character shined through her words and actions beneath that arrogant surface lay a very insecure unsatisfied unfulfilled and angry person i can understand why she didnt have a man who would want her her hatred of men i think was more of a jealousy she had no compassion so she tried to make up for it in her intelligence and literacy she tried to hide behind those midwife skills although the book was long it was shallow and i expected a deeper plot.
gibbons weaves a compelling influencial novel about three generations of women and the lives they lived and their impact on one another detailed first person through margaret birchs eye this story tells of margargets coming of age during world war  the book tells of margarets mother who constantly strives to be young and stylish and concequently is quite irresponsibleand her grandmother a selfproclaimed doctor who always seems to have the right answer as well as unconditoinal love for her grand daughter with whom she lives in a dramatic ending margaret realized that she has to move on from her sheltered homelife and must learn to face the world on her own two feet.
i couldnt help comparing this novel to the book of ruth like ruth it is an intriguing look at the life of a girl growing up and the influence of family members on this growth but unlike ruth this book is positive this book is uplifting this book is a joy to read this book is about intelligence wit and love this is a book id like to write pick this one upthen pass it along.
dean  love the book  especially the pictures of gavin and me  but you know that to anyone else who reads this dean knows whereof he speaks hes a good hiker and builds a good environmentally sensitive campfire hope you dont mind my using this avenue to try to get your email address.
major spoilerdont read if you dont want to knowbefore i invested time watching this i wish i had found a review saying there was a death of a major character at the end i wouldnt have bothered it wasnt that good anyway maybe this review will save someone giving it  stars because ive seen abyssal films that only deserve star and this is not that bad.
this was a random movie i picked out on netflix to watch and i am so glad i did i laughed i cried i know it sounds cliche but what an amazing love story such a great message.
i caught this movie today on lmn when i was channel surfing unfortunately i missed the first  minutes i tried not to let kent moran distract me from the plot but hes gorgeous hes a screenwriter musician and actor huh not just a pretty face anyways back to the movie it was a movie about real people that i could relate to im buying this so i can see what i missed.
great movie filmed in new york directed by matt thompson and written by kent moran scenes were filmed with the red cam so it feels like youre right there with the actors its a great story about a high society deaf girl controlled by her mother and an ordinary joe who works for a living who fall in love his dream is music and so is hers even though she cant hear make sure to have your tissue ready for it will tug at your heart and the tears will comeit has won many awards in the film festivals throughout the us one which was best director at the beverly hills film festivalits another love story movie worth watching.
this is an ok book it is action packed and holds your attention i think that the main charecter dick shelton is a lot like many people today even though the book takes place in medieval times dick did not know that he was fighting for his enemy sir daniel the man who had killed his father i think this is one of the best historical fiction books that i have ever read i hope that you will like it as much as i did.
when comparing stevensons major works this book just doesnt compare its wooden stilted and written in the voice of northern uks speech.
i am an avid fan of dm and will do the best job at being objective about their work although i think this album is great and it has many quintessential dm songs there are some songs that i often skip over these songs are definitely not my favorites but i think mostly that they just dont appeal to me in the context of this album this is why i label this transitions i love all periods of dm but i notice this one seems to be one that incorporates the earlier new wave feeling of previous albums but also ushers in the darker era of dm i tend to prefer the darker dm but appreciate the earlier work especially if not simultaneously if you are even a slight fan of their work you will enjoy this album.
this cd blows nothing worth listening to really sucks the big unit one of there worst cdsthank you very muchyour welcome.
very disappointed with this amp it has an auto shut off which is a cool feature however it randomly shuts off while in use very frustrating.
this amp does what it is supposed to do only thing i wasnt aware of was that the ab speaker switches dont allow output to go to both speakers at the same time maybe this was in the write up but if so i missed it.
an annoying amount of hum and hiss comes from my speakers the noise is still there without any inputs to the amplifier and it increases as i turn up the volume knob.
great amp for the speakers in my garage and lanaisounds great and easy to usesimple is goodplus the price is right.
i have a wholehouse sound entertainment system which includes a pair of speakers in the dining room a pair of speakers in the living room and a pair of speakers in the bedroom i have a airportexpress connected directly to this unit and it has no problem powering all six pairs of inceiling speakers in fact this unit is so powerful i cannot turn the volume up beyond the midpoint because i fear that my windows will break an excellent product for the pricenote this unit has a single rca output so make sure you use a splitter if you intend to connect multiple pairs of speakers to this amplifier.
these other reviewers are kidding youthere are significant problems with this dvd the audio on this dvd is horrible it sounds like they are talking and singing through a tube i could have done better in my garage the tracks are all the singing and stories in english or the same program in mandarin there is no teaching whatsoeveri realize there are not many dvds for teaching children mandarin however there are a few better than this.
im not a math cripple but i will admit that i have not always been that great when it comes to math i have recently grown a hunger for science in general  including mathematics of course and thought i should look for a book to help me grasp math from another perspective i actually read many of the pages in the book and while i did understand the first couple pages  i found myself lost as i continue reading as another reviewer mentioned  this is not a book for the layman i wouldnt recommend this book to anyone who is not that good at math i guess ill just keep looking elsewhere to find books on the subject that will help me on my journey to become better at math.
 or  college buds all court the same row captain and then she becomes pregnantfocuses all around the bar and their goofinesswhen word comes out she has a kid they all rush not knowing who is the dad and they all step up  but it is pretty playful and not realistic.
i have bought about  pairs of this short they are very confortable and wear very well im pretty hard on them because i wear them for work the hold up very well good purchase.
this biblical fiction is a great introduction to the story of king hezekiah the characters have depth and i am eager to read the next book in the series.
chronicles of the kings  was a great introduction to the series i gained a different insight into the history.
this was a great book to read i had a hard time putting it down can not wait to read the next one.
i love history  especially biblical history and this book uses the information in the bible and then builds on that information with researched information to make it come alive it seemed like a long book at the start but it ended too soon.
loved the connection not only with history and the bible but also with lynns interpretation of the characters made me want to seek out the word in the kings and chronicles anything that leads us to the lord has to be great.
i have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about i followed the directions nothing happened brewed a stronger cupstill nothingeven measured out the water to oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutesnothing just stronger tasting tea on the box it tells you not to drink more than  cup in a  hour period i drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else strange.
i got the tea fast and followed the instructions only drinking  cup which had no effect on my system it taste pretty good though.
sometimes one forgets the great singers of but a few years ago this  performance recording made in tokyo though visually a bit dark is acoustically sparkling with the singers joy with donizettis music he would surely loudly applaud this effort both fiorenza cossotto and alfredo kraus are at their peak to say nothing of sesto bruscantini and ruggero raimondi in supporting roles this opera unfortunately is often overlooked for the better known donizetti works well worth enjoying as the music is grand the arias are among his finest and the ballet a treat to see.
the first and second robocop films were great i loved the overthetop action and humor elements in both filmsrobocop  is a pure unadulterated disaster first off it is way too tame a pg rating second the plot is completely ruined by the introduction of the cute little kid who is a computer whiz character what a travesty third the movie is actually borin.
when a movie has dialogue like i thought your ninja was supposed to take care of robocop it aint gonna be citizen kane it wont even be a good robocop movie but if you must indulge look for the strings holding up robocop when he flies yes i said look for the strings holding up robocop when he flies.
i enjoyed all but one of the  stories in this book from  to  even though i didnt enjoy pamela zolines the heat death of the universe i can see why it is an important story to include in this collection of some of the science fiction that can be seen as feminist seen as feminist here is the key i think especially when you look at the essays paired with each story a few of the essays were spot on  looked at the author and the story in their historical context others rambled between sharing previous scholarship and trying to find multiple readings of the material one of which was a feminist interpretation the  stories are intense and moving challenging the reader while entertaining i loved that they were organized chronologically because i could see a flow and development of the feminist voice i wish a concluding essay had tied them all together to bring this out more.
everything about album makes me wanna grab a gun and shoot myself thats how bad it is its lacks emotion and it sounds forced like they are trying to hard to spread the word instead of trying to make good music everything about this cd is so generic so dull so predictable only a moron would think this is a worth while cd to listen too.

originally i purchased this book because my granddaughters name is sophia and i know how little ones enjoy stories that include their name but i would purchase this book for a little one just because it is a good book the pictures are bright and bold the text right at the level of a preschooler and it opens up to display a long train a fun book to read together.
i must say that even for troma this one was pretty bad a plane crash leaves tourists stranded on a tropical island that happens to be the home base of a group of nasty terrorists now think troma how would you work with this plot needless to say there are many dead before it ends i thought there was a limit to the amount of blood and guts one could put into a movie and smear on a womans breasts untill i saw war the movie is rather low quality not like some of the newer troma releases but if you like classic troma it dosnt get any more classic than this not one for the kiddies.

i remember being about  or  years old and being frightened out of my mind by the scary bjork lady dancing around on a truck on mtv sufficet to say i couldnt understand why she was getting rave reviews a coupla years later i saw her on jay leno singing a bigband song and loved it the screaming was a little odd for me but i recanted and bought the single to its oh so quiet can you say excellent i immediately went out and purchased this cd post and was blown away at how awesome it is there are so many good songs on here it is definitley a cd everyone should own dont miss it and by the way bjork being scary just makes her oh so much more appealing wouldnt you say.
im a big bjork fan  im also a big fan of the higher fidelity dvd audio format and remastered cd sound although some remasters are atrocious  so i thought this disc was a great buyhowever i wasnt pleased to find that the cd audio side wont play in the car or on the computer as its not recognized as a cd audio disc apparently not uncommon with dual discs  just as frustrating is the lack of true dvdaudio using mlp meridian lossless which is superior to the dolby and dts surround sound provided here interestingly my computer was happy to read the dvd side but reports the surround sound as  for both dolby and dts not the  claimed if you are looking for the superior audio you thought this disc offered  then youll need to be happy playing it on your dvd player only disappointing i already own the videos on dvd  so i havent taken that into consideration in this review.
this version of the play is missing acts iii and ivact iv scene ii contains some of the most famous lines of shakespeare fear no more the heat of the sun  so if you need this play are crunched for time and need it to supplement a research paper on streamofconsciousness and mrs dalloway  i would definitely get another versionthanks a lot for the complete rip off.
this is the same dvd that i had previously purchased with a different cover i will keep it because i like the workout and the previous dvd skips in places.
this cd was alot different than waiter the first track is the next eight put together long ambiant phases between dark synth driven songs much more digital than the pervious album his vice is possibly better in this cd definatly worth the ep price.
i have been buying these before from microcenter they are very cheap and i thought it was a very good deal particularly their mah for  bucks butconsof all the nimh batteries i tried this has the most number of failures some just dies some would hold very low charges after just a few cyclesit is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgetsexterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed deformedprosprice but for this kind of quality not worth italso with all the new low discharge batteries flooding the market eneloops rayovacs duracell kodak etc there is no longer any reason to buy this kind of batteries even this company is now manufacturing their own hybrio.

if you want to shoot bbs at your room mate indoors this is definitely the way to go has a ridiculous rate of fire which is faster than the pulse m but it is also weaker than the pulse m the hopper doesnt hold as many bbs as it should however .
every recipe i have tried thus far has been either  bland or  outright disgusting i need to throw this book away before i waste more time and money on disastrous recipessilken chocolate pie nastyblack bean dip tastelessskinny dip i cant believe this is considered foodone plus is that it inspired some great dishes since i dont eat eggs high protein breakfasts are hard to come by i made a tofu veggie casserole not following the books recipe but rather the general concept and it came out wonderfulbut all in all this book has been a waste of money beyond the purchase and shipping costs.
this looked great at first but then i started looking at the calorie counts for most of the dishes most of the main dishes have less than  calories some have less than  i dont have time to cook and eat  meals per day.

i didnt think anger was a real problem for me until i got married and some things i thought to be essential needs werent being met by my spouse this book has shown me some powerful principles on how to understand and deal with my anger constructively rather than destructively.

this item is too short besides being too small it doesnt fit well at all at least it didnt cost too much.
i found this novel to be cumbersome and uninspiring there was not one likable character i wanted to take frances by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.
the book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about how can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you dont allow them to be well educated about it remember the just say no program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction well telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and its certainly no different when it comes to sex no wonder the bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following dobsons pathetic advice whereas the west coast and the northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students if youre going to read this book be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack.
it was so true and definitely helpful teenagers will find encouragement because someone took the time to explain all those confusing changes they go through.
islamic mysticism a secular perspective by ibn alrawandi prometheus books any believer needs to fairly read some debunking views of ones beliefs first it is always important to know other points of view even if they do not persuade or even tend to subvert the truth of the positions one holds as true and lifesaving this book offers a critique of the sufi path of transformation by a former seeker who feels there is serious deception and selfdeception on the spiritual path and it is better to be rational and consistent in ones views than to seek fantastical delusions now such a position is unlikely to appeal to the mystic but if one wants to mature in ones mysticism one should give such naysayers a careful hearing concede their good points and carefully critique the limitations of their point of view otherwise perhaps such rationalists are correct and such pursuits are bunk.
rawandi contends that reliable sources undermine the classical account of islam and sufism and his study seeks to rectify this imbalance through studying the philosophy of religion and traditionalists to provide a new critical analysis of islam readers already well versed in islamic religion and history will find this a scholarly detailed probe.
what a piece of derivative garbage  already made this album and made it better years ago give up now and focus on the homework kids this music is taking to straight to the unemployment line.

this is an amazing little pot it brews fast no leaking and the coffee tastes great i have been using it for  months now and no problems so i got my mom one and she loves it great for those days when you only want a little coffee.
two years ago i brought it and like it i drink coffee in the morning so only used it only once a day few month after i brought it its heat plate started growing rusty i continuely used it for additional six month when the  heat plate was rusted i thought it was an incidence so i threw it away and brought the same model again nine month late  heat plate is rusted this time i dont think it is a incidence again.
i bought this product for the girlfriend who happens to be be a smoker her car always smelled really bad abviously i purchased this to try and curb the smell and surprisingly despite the small size of this product it works very well keeps the car smelling fresh even after being smoked in.
these guys are really a good match together so funny and fun to watch with the family i wish it had the thin man which for some reason i thought this had but i ended up getting the thin man collection later anyways.
this is a beautifully presented box set of powell  loy which gives youan insight to films they made together other than the thin man seriesthe clarity of the discs and the sound quality surprised me consideringthe films ageas for the actors i would buy a film of powell and loy shopping inwalmart im that easily pleased but if you want to see the golden ageof hollywood and a mixture of drama and screwball comedy at its bestthen look no further.
while this book didnt scare me i found it laughable and largely useless for the majority of twincarrying women who like and trust their obgyns believe that pain is generally to be avoided and are actually comforted by the fact that institutions such as hospitals exist also i found the book highly offensive in that it strongly suggested that miscarriage in twin pregnancies is caused by a mothers doubts about carrying twins gee what a wonderful guilt trip to impose on a grieving mother.
i read this book while i was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary it was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome along the lines of when not even one of the triplets lived i went out and got drunk and seemed to dwell on every possible problem and complication to the point that i was quite stressed and anxious when in fact my twins were born naturally five days before the predicted due date had none of the complications this horrible book made me worry about and were in excellent health in fact i so dislike the book that i go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it in addition the dietary advice is ridiculous and its impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby so unless you like being scared i recommend against buying this book.
writer uses the war as filler while trying to pass off child molesting as romance couple doesnt get together until the end of the book big disappointment and some mistakes with civil war history.

passion street is a cracking single from former dr hook vocalist dennis locorriere the close harmony backing vocals  denniss spoken intro instantly remind you of the old band while retaining a fresh crisp sound well wort checking out as is the album.
queen loved to experiment every time they released a new song i would hear it and say in delight is that queen however this album abandoned all that was rock and roll and gave into the pop craze of disco that can only be classified as the dark ages in pop music the only bright spot from this album was under pressure thankfully they pulled out of it to cement themselves as one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
i had enough of a balance on a gift card for one cd after listening to samples of selections from liona boyd ana vidovic susan isbin and martha masters i came across this one i listed to the samples over and over and finally ordered it largely because i liked the sounds of the duet once i received the cd and played the selections all the way through i think i made the right choice this is a superb collection these two ladies brilliantly blend melodies and harmonies with a little dissonance thrown in here and thereive had it for a few months now and its still as fresh as when i first listened to it you know sometimes when you get a new cd youre hyped up on it and listen to it over and over but then after a while it takes its place amongst the rest of your collection not this one for me whenever i need to wind down this is the one i listen to and i havent grown tired of it yet.
saw them at an outdoor concert and they were great this is a good cd even if you do not care that much for bluegrass you will like this.
as a huge fan of buffyonly the original novels though this whole series was actually pretty good i may still like the gatekeepers trilogy better but hey each of these  books were only  or so and they dont take long to read worth a look .
my poor son was so eager to play with this toy after receiving it for his birthday but he was quickly disappointed the tank was too heavy when filled with water and the straps would not adjust enough to fit on him we had to rig the straps the tube would come out of the tank when i tried to pump the tank which i had to pump repeatedly was not a toy that he could play with on his own someone had to be present to constantly pump it was just as disappointed with another spiderman blaster they need to change the age range on these toys to  and up.
i dont remember ever seeing my nephews play with this toyim sure i didnt pay much for it but the excitement for this toy didnt last too long after the initial opening on christmas eve.
see the reviews for the aua  a similar item with one extra  port adaptec has some crazy requirements for a power supply v a and used to offer one that fit them through their store but apparently no longer do without the adapter this unit is only usable for items that draw almost no power through the usb or  connection  which is a shame because the adaptec  implementation was always the most stable on my machines look for one that includes an ac adapter or some other way of bringing power to the unit instead.

i could not finish this messeveryone in it should be embarrassed kind of a very poor production  story and cast.
slow paced and dragging this story could have been told in a better way even those with mental illness are not so lackluster i was grateful for fast forward.
fun if you have a young male child that isnt into the music it fart and burps and makes annoying noises during the music not the toy for me but i think little boys would find it funny but i do see it getting old quick.
i give this collection of sonatas only two stars because the way they were recorded only allows two fifths of them to play on my bose i returned them once received a quick replacement  the same most of them have to be played in the car also i believe barenboim plays some of the sonatas too fast  just because he can.
i first heard of these guys in a short article of guitar world and later found this cd at a music show for pretty cheap and decided to pick it up while the songs are very heavy complete with loud vocals humorous lyrics heavy fast power chords and screaming solos what do you expect from a s punk band np proves to the world that they play what they want to and not what the public wants to hear their live shows sound very interesting complete with a firebreathing bassist and crazy stage antics if you like it loud and fast give this one a try you gotta love the cover too heh.
i love this sauce whisk its comfortable to hold while whisking and easy to clean i highly reccomend getting one for yourself.

r kellys carrer is full of contradictions on one song hes singing about how good god is then the next song hes feeling on ya boody r kelly has so much potential to be a respectful artist but if he continues on the corse he is now the qualtiy of his character will continue to be decline along with his music.

these are good shoes they have a classic look and the monochrome look adds a nice little something something a good safe buy.
converse unisex chuck taylor all star plaid hi sneakergreat shoes at a great price my daughter loves them .
i love these shoes and have owned many chuck taylor converse shoes for  years i did forget that when getting this shoe i must order a size smaller than my regular shoe size this can be frustrating when ordering shoes online so dont forget to order size down .
im accustomed to dansko sanita and allegria shoes which are all very comfortable but require a break in period im ok with that but these never seemed to get broken in maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands im on my feet  hours a day on concrete walking around and up and down stairs for several miles a day sometimes with long periods standing im an adulteducation instructor i have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe i could wear from time to time and was hoping these would be it i wear a   in womens and the  chucks fit my foot well thankful i read the other reviews and knew what size to order but they just arent the shoe for me.
awesome shoes what can i say look great with pants jeans khakis whatever versatile durable sylish you wont regret this purchase maybe run a half size bigger than my size but its iffy.
this chef coat is very very large i ordered a med if you are a ladies size  or larger this may fit you  but the coat has no shaping whatsoever  so you will look like a big marshmallow mine is white  also where the collar meets at the neck has a very large space  which is not traditional and looks very odd the fabric quality is ok which for the price is not so great perhaps this was cut for men but the buttons and fabric would make it too girly this coat design needs to be amended and shaped and the overlap where the buttons cross over needs to be rethought as the fabric hangs down and bunches under the coat  so the bottom hem is not clean  it needs a button underneeth or something to stop that from happening.
i have read this play and also performed the part of joan on stage many times shaws play brings the soul of joan to life a girl with no formal education  defeated the english won a crown for a king and was tried and burned as a witch  dead at or under the age of  no wonder she was made a saint the story would almost be a horrible fairy tale if it wasnt true.
i will not usually recommend a mono cd unless there is no other version of the work in question or the performance is superlative well there are many recent cds filled with the antique music but none bear up so well as the amadeus reissue of the  instrumental music of  amd  as performed by the concentus musicus wien under nikolaus harnoncourt the man who was one of the pioneers of period instruments in recordings here we have  cuts of music from france du tertre du caurroy england holborne morley tomkins cooper bevin germany sommer posch scheidt and italy cabrielli gumai massaino all of which is available elsewhere and perhaps some of which is played as well and in better sound i will deduct a ratingpoint however for its short running time of  minutes but all in all this is gorgeous music gorgeously played.
this wellwritten book examines virtually all arguments regarding the death penalty in addition to exposing current practices just revenge also puts the death penalty in an historical context its inevitable conclusion as it demolishes every wellcherished but incorrect justification for the death penalty with the exception of a clause in the th amendment  is that the only thing proponents have left on their side is indeed just revenge mark costanzos own opinion is clear virtually from the start but he backs it up with fact after devastating fact if you want to learn more about the death penalty this is an excellent place to begin it is also a useful reference book as it is chockfull of statistics and anecdotes.
these caps are hard to find being a deputy sheriff it is a necessary item to have i have put it to good use and found it to be recognizable and protective best yet the price was reasonable for a quality product.

i have been reading this book in my intro to native american studies and i hate it i feel it give the wrong image towards northwest native history.
be careful scrapbookers this is not like the original cropper hopper it is not deep enought to fit x paper dont make the same mistake i did.
ordered two and billed for two as christmas presents received one which was a misassembled plastic piece of garbage oh well my fault for buying jewelry over the net should at least receive what i ordered however so i wrote the dealer to either send the second one or issue a refund never could get a reply threw the one that had arrived in the trash would have given this a negative rating if  were not the lowest number available.
i read this book two years ago and had the opportunity to participate in an interview with the author on national public radio ms gibbons was gracious of course but she could not answer the obvious difficulties in this book the chronology is confused and while the book reaches for important issues ie the need for a young girl to have a mother the treatment of the characters is shallow the longing is there and it is expressed well but ultimately the miraculous healing of the mother and her immediate death after her restorationundermine whatever strength was in the novelthe one character that the reader has no trouble believing is pearl the caring maternal housekeeper she is a jewel of characterization much needed and appreciated in this novel.
maybe its because ive been listening to the energetic and inspired electronic music of german industrialebm for the past few years or perhaps its just prodigy did not put enough effort into this release whatever the reason i cant recommend this singlebabys got a temper just does not catch the attention of my ears in ways it does mimic the style of a few of prodigys past songs with the break beats and repeating synth lines but it just cant match the magic of their former hits like breathe and firestarter the remixes of babys got a temper are not really that much to look forward to on this single either even diehard prodigy fans should find somewhere to listen to this single first before buying it hopefully prodigys upcoming album will incorporate some more inspired songs for redemption from this lackluster single.
the prodigy are backbabys got a temper is a fantastic record  just whatwe need right now in an age where all the music industryhas to offer is endless dire amounts of popgarbagethe only bad thing i have to say about this great cd isthat the other mixes dont vary too much from the originaltrack being a dub and instrumental respectively i wouldhave preferred a couple of new tracksthat said babys got a temper is such a greatcatchy song that i still enjoy the other versions and ijust cant get enough of the tune itself anyway great video tooabsolutely recommended.
the first song i heard on this album was bounce and to be quite honest i wasnt impressed but i saw the cd at best buy and thought why not i must say it has not been something ive regretted this is numetal years ahead of any other band you will find out there with insightful underlying political protest all the way through but if you want an album to just rock out to well this is actually an amazing choice anyway there is some amazing stuff here like chop suey a deeply touchingdisturbing song about the unpleasant topic of suicide and toxicity a song about the terrible disorder in the world with the split of rage against the machine there is little possible competition for system on their way to the numetal top.
as much as i enjoyed system of a downs first effort it took me a long time to get into this one but i guess im like that with every new cd a band comes out with anyway i think that on this cd serj shows more of his vocal ability to go really high than down to a near death metal scream in prison song but i was disapointed that the drummer did not do any crazy drum solos as he did on the bands selftitled debut all in all i really enjoyed this cd and i would highly recommend for anyone who is starting to get into metal or into system of a down the single chop suey is definitely one of the songs where the bands demonstrates the most musical talent in my opininon although the sound of the song is a bit more radiofriendly than the rest of the cd it is still a great song another song with great talent is the song toxicity which has proven to become my favorite on this multifaceted album.
awsome cdalmost evry song is worth listening toprison songpogoand chop suey are all realy good.
im going to make this short and sweet its not the greatest album in the world because i still cant listen to the whole thing straight through but i just have to say that toxicity is one of my most favorite songs in the world you just cant beat the guitars in this song and the drums are amazing chop suey is also great its got interesting allusions to god and jesus psycho is good headbanging fun and warns you to stay away from cocaine too and aerials is nice and meaningful oh and bounce is hilarious but ill leave it up to you to buy the album and figure out what theyre really talking about.
listin to the velvet undergrounds murder mystery and then listen to chop suey you can not tell me they didnt rip that intro from the velvetsi dont care about this cd i just felt like saying that they ripped the velvet undergrounds murder mystery off.
i may have enjoyed this album had i been  years old or deaf strangely enough i listen to new and old metal but there is somethin about this band i dont like  his voice is very annoying from the get go where are they going with this garbageits been awhile since weve seen some fresh new metalmusic that is decent and i have a feeling something is coming cause if it isnti dont think this genre will be pop much longer.
this cd is really  really awesome its not that i only like this heavy metalrock genre quite frankly i like every type of music besides country that isheh this is a review coming a person who likes everything from dido to disturbed rap rock whatever i like it all this is just a really good cd for anyone who likes any music at all and also has very good taste very great work from soad that should be enjoyed by everyone.
along with their self titled album these two are the best albums i have heard ever by any group.
this is one bad rear group i have both of their albums and the only problem is that i listen to them so much that i cant get the songs out of my headkiller lyrics and wonderful beats you wont be disappointed.
there is only  good songs on this cd and you here them on the radio all the time this is depressing dreadful music i wanted to slash my wrist after listening to it but instead i broke it and toss it in the trash can were it belongs.
upon hearing the song toxicity on mtv i had absolutely no hesitation in buying this album knowing that it would contain at least one gem what i didnt expect was such consistencyinitially tracks like x and forest do not stand out as much as mtv hits chop suey and toxicity however on further listens you will discover that it is the lesser known tracks that hold your interest and ensure this album stays in your cd player for a while i now hope to see these guys live at some stage to see if the energy displayed on this album translates as well in live performance.
this is a great cdi have listened to this cd probably  times and it never gets oldall the songs are good.
this music is sooo old and tired these punks are your typical angry californiansyou know the oneslets all riot and then cry discrimination when the police arrest us for commiting crimes lets overthrow the corupt government the government puts too many people in jail etc etc blah blah  anyway musically the cd is average and lirically the cd is terrible only a cute video and mtvs air play  have brought commercial success to these sad sacks .
ok chop suey is the only good song on this cd if u expect that this cd will be like there last lp thats where your wrong they seem to have a christiangospel touchinsted more of a heavy metalrock touch if u want some real metalrock try slipknotstaticxdisturbedslayerpentara and more artists like that.
nice case good quality phone fit a bit snug to start but loosening upand fitting better with time.

poor adam crall reviewer cameroon is its own frenchspeaking nation in africa it is not in south africa which is also an independent nation.
we are really enjoying this puzzle and learning a lot the information written on the oceans makes the puzzle more interesting and manageablethe pieces are necessarily very small to match the size of the countries the bigger problem is that they curl up just a bit so the pieces dont lie flat as you make the puzzle this is frustrating and you dont get that satisfying feeling as you put a piece in as you have to press it down a few times and it still doesnt quite flatten down im trying covering the finished puzzle with heavy books but i suspect its just a problem of cheap gluestill i give it four stars since a good world puzzle is very hard to find and the content is good.
bought  of these with the idea of keeping one and giving the other to my mother neither worked well and failed soon after using the seller was magnificent and refunded our money.
i thought that this was a positive development in the series bringing in new characters and expanding on the plot worlds development the first part is devoted to developing new characters and expanding threads while the last third is action with the characters this has a lot of foreshadowing and will fit in with follow books and new series overall worthwhile reads best when in conjunction with the other books in the series.
victoria hamilton seems to pop up everywhere whether in lesser parts as in pride and prejudice in bad girl parts such as in mansfield park or in this delightful version of the complex relationship between victoria and albert this one needs to be compared with a somewhat different interpretation of the relationship in the young victoria victorias handling of her long period of grief over alberts death is also well done in mrs brown for english history lovers all of these are worth viewing interesting and nicely filmed.
electronic power pop that sounds fresh to this day the beats are more bubblegum punk than straightup dance music the songs have hooks the archies would kill for catchy and completely addictive you can bet your modern day synthpop bands like ladytron freezepop hyperbubble and bis listened to this stuff in their sleep many say its depeche mode at their best many disagree whatever the case theres no other dm album like it and every song is great if you eat this electrocandy up and want more there are a few more speak and spell moments on dms second albumcomment  why no voting buttons we dont let customers vote on their own reviews so the voting buttons appear only when you look at reviews submitted by others.
if you like battles against ultimate evil religious overtones and special effects  with a twist rent constantine yes you have to suspend disbelief yes you have to accept somewhat twodimensional personalities but if you get past that you get a nicely shot tense supernatural crime saga with a couple of interesting characters most folks will have never heard of constantine or hellblazer on which the movie is loosely based but its fine if you havent the movie is good enough on its own for an enjoyable night.
lamebrain film that not only rips off a much better film out there the prophecy but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades keanu reeves is still his same self here which means that he gives another boring acting turn his fellow costars do far more in their parts with rachel weisz being the stand out giving a great performance that has resonance and guts djimon hounsou is good as well but hes barley in the film plus peter stormare and tilda swinton have great cameos that really should have been bigger roles weisz hounsou stormare and swinton give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that they are worthy of the praise especially rachel weisz who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage its really is but regardless of their worthy acting turns the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does no know how to direct a movie.
this is bad really perhaps it is one of those movies which can only be fully understood or enjoyed if familiar with the comic that originated it it does not even have the redeeming quality of being a decent action film guilty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment boring boring and boring for that alone it will burn in cinematic hell.
extremely awful keanu reeves stinker that not only lives up to the word of mouth but surpasses it in spades keanu proves once and for all on how bad an actor he is with a groundbreaking bad performance and a script that helps him out a lot in proving that only his costars come out of this film with their heads held up high with great performances by rachel weisz djimon hounsou and peter stormare but not even their great performances can salvage this disaster this is fresh material for the show  mystery science theater  and i hope they can get a print of this movie and tear it apart for the garbage it really is.
dumb keanu reeves horror epic that is not only the actors worse film by far but a bad film in its own right keanu is just wrong for the role and the script is joke in many ways most of the performances are not very good shia labeouf was horrible and made keanu look like an oscar winner by comparison the only performance of merit is that of rachel weisz and she literally keeps you glued to your seat with her powerful and emotional performance unfortunately while she gives her all the rest of the movie is in self destruction mold all around her with bad special effects very bad dialog and a story that makes no sense what so everi stand with the majority rachel weisz is the only good thing about this film so wait for dvd to see this film and in the mean time rent runaway jury or the shape of things two very good movies that compliment weiszs performance unlike this one does.
terrible adaptation of the great comic book hellblazer is nothing short of a spit in the eye of the fans of the comic book with a terrible and down right crude performance by keanu reeves who makes a joke out of one of the most beloved cult comic book characters made in the last twenty years his performance is bad to the point of wanting to throw something at the screen just out of sheer rage the screenplay is a joke and the dialog rages from bad to much worse as the movie progresses and the special effects are so badly done that the monsters would have been better off if they were puppets instead some of the actors in the film are better than the film itself with great performances by rachel weisz who is the only ray of light this movie really has and djimon hounsou who is the only actor who does his comic book character any justice despite rachel weisz the movie is bad and not even her talent could have saved it.
i havent been able to get this movie out of my head i love it it was such a brilliant take on the comic book adaption sure i was disappointed at first about the casting choice to play constantine but it turned out so much better than i expected and i grew to love it i cant wait for a sequelreeves did an outstanding job capturing the spirit of john constantine and rachel weisz gave her all the two had such great chemistry and i am thankful they didnt overplay the relationship thing by not overfluffing the movie its a great flick you should consider adding this to your collectionkudos to francis lawrence for doing such an outstanding job as a first time movie director.
constantine has accepted his fate and made peace with it he knows that death and a hellish afterlife are imminent flawed and fatalistic cigarette between his fingers he plods along throwing himself into one horrific situation after another in an effort to help a woman he doesnt even know its creepy and powerful angels devils and friends the guilty and innocent keanu reeves is perfect in this role and its a movie to watch again and again liked it a lot reminds me of sandman slim stories.
this movie is garbage stay home and save your money my friendsand i were trying to stay awake through the entire film although i dont know why sleeping would have been a more productive use of our time rather than wasting time trying to figure out this film when the old tired plot finally starts to unravel we didnt care what was going on i felt that the actors are an insignificant part of this movie they dont matter in other words this film is so bad it doesnt matter who was in front of the camera no one could save this trash the film is very dark shot like a low budget film with a few special effectsmy friends and i can honestly say that we did not like anything about this film.
some wear and tear on the case but other than that the dvd itself works great thanks so much .
this is a decent movie to get a good fright to lol just as good as when i saw it in theaters i have the dvd and bluray now time to ditch the dvd lol  stars.
horrible adaptation of the vertigo comic book is not only a smack in the face of the followers of the book with a flat out moronic screenplay that takes all the good out of the comic but also has the worse actor to play the title role of john constantine keanu reeves not only makes the role into a joke with his lack of talent but makes everyone around him look bad as well the cinematography is ugly making the movie a real eye sour and the special effects lack a certain feel to it out of the entire cast only rachel weisz comes out with her dignity intact with a very good performance that the movie squanders in order to let keanu act like a darker version of his neo character towards the latter half of the film they should have taken the material seriously and made a great horror movie out of it but instead we have a childrens movie that geared to matrix headsavoid this film like the plague.
my goodness i rented this movie expecting a scary thriller and it almost put me to sleep this is keanu reeves sorriest performance to date not that he has had many good ones his acting was horrible in this movie and the whole movie did not make sense and was just plain boring to watch i was very disappointed for this film is just plain awful.
what do you get when you have an actor who cant act a director who cant direct and a script that is so badly written that you will be laughing your head off at the same time you are throwing up at the pure stupidity of it you get one of the worse movies ever made keanu reeves performance in this film is so bad it makes his bill and ted movies look oscar worthy the direction from first time director frances lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors mouths from time to time of all the actors involved only rachel weisz and are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved other than them almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie.
horrible and down right stupid keanu reeves actionhorror movie not only makes the people who pay to see it look stupid but it solidify him as one of the worse actors of our generation with a horrible performance that makes everything about this film into a joke i feel sorry for his fellow actors which includes rachel weisz who give the movies only real performance for even being on the same screen with him because despite their good work and effort he manages to make the movie into a real choir to watchthe word of mouth is justified for this piece of garbage.
very bad keanu reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as keanus performance out of the entire cast only rachel weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script which is excruciatingly bad and the direction which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish the story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build upmaybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film.
dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part with a dimwitted performance by keanu reeves who is miscast in the main role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be a lot has been said about rachel weisz being the only good thing that this movie has to offer and i will agree with that assessment because she does make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being told weiszs performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence there is no reason to even stay till the end hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the very bestfor weiszs rich and powerful performance i give the movie two stars if she were not in the movie my rating would be in negative numbers .
truly a pathetic filmthe only few minutes of the film that was interesting was the very beginning after this it raced downhillthe demons and characters were all unbelievable except for the female lead i can not fathom the audience for this film except for the blind deaf and dumb i have never been a fan of keanu reeves but some of his films have been exciting he brought nothing to this nothing it is hard to tell whether the fault is the script the director or the actor in short the film was a total waste of time more than that it was a total theft of time.
i did not like the movie as the dialogue was whispered and it was difficult to understand what was being said and to make it even more objectionable the audio level would overwhelm when the scene cut to an action event the audio level had to be constantly adjusted and the picture was not very sharp even with a hidef monitor it is suggested amazon get a limiting amplifier or one of the old cbs audiomax units like tv broadcasters used in the s to prevent the commercials audio levels from annoying the viewers run all movies through an audio processor and get this under controljim.
horrible cant describe this movie in a right light this was the worse film i have seen in years and this should prove once and for all on how bad keanu reeves is as an actor because hes at his worse in this film hes so bad that he has the uncanny ability to make you feel stupid once the movie is over thats how bad he is the script is a huge mess and most of it does not make sense what so ever and the picture is way too dark in certain areas of the film rachel weisz is great in the movie but shes basically carrying keanu on her shoulders during most of the film while he over acts in horrific ways and she is stranded with a story that really should have had a good rewrite before it became a shooting script other than her the movie is just a huge help of crap that should not have been made.
not very good horror action movie that has the right stuff but lacks a certain amount of credibility to mix keanu reeves is semifine but miscast and he lacks a character the audience can root for and the rest of the movie is hit or miss in terms of the script which is badly written and the special effects which are not up to par in terms of what has been accomplish recently i have to agree with what has been said about rachel weisz who is the heart and soul of this movie and she does lift it over the mediocre script and funny dialog her performance is golden and worthy of a much better moviesee it for her alone but you will end up feeling sorry for her for being the only good thing about the whole movie.
didnt see this listed but if you put the supplimental disc in an xbox you can play the constantine video game.
i brought this tires for a friend in  x  she hasnt had a problem nor has she had a flat and she loves them.
i bought this tire for asphalt and cement roads like its name  city ride  but after using them for some monthsi noticed that if you have them with too much pressure the on bumps the bike can hit pretty hard and you can lose the control if you are not prepare.
i found this book very useful being a practicing christan and not being into wicca or witchcraft i have never had the occassion to purchase a book on candle burning before now i had always associated such practices and being associated with satan worship boy was i dead wrong the author says that candle burning is a positive force in the universeand not at all negative like i had thought i got out my bible and did one or two of the candle burning spells and found that the room was immediately energized with white light all around i felt very peaceful    i had wanted to help someone in my family overcome a bad situation in their life its somewhat of a personal matter so i wont go into it here and a few days later i received a phone call from the family member and it turned out what i had prayed for using this book came abouti have given this book to others to use and they also report very positive benefits so i would recommend it to anyone who asked.
all i reall have to say is this book is a complete waste of time and money dont bother.
yellow plastic not matched to metal portions perfectly but okay it was good for the price still dont know what the reference to gerber was.
i made this gum with my  and  year old daughters i ended up making  of the recipe myself the gum is impossible to stir and never had a smooth consistancy the food coloring red and blue stain everything and is impossible to get off of your handsyou have to use you hands to knead the gum the worst part is that even after all of that the gum tasted terrible i highly doubt that the manufacturer truely tested this process with parents and children frustrating and a waste of time.
from the time of order to receipt the book took longer than any vendor ive ordered from previously there were no courtesy notification of when the item was sent to gauge the time of delivery the condition of the book was as promised overall i wouldnt order from the same vendor again.
one of the last great southern rock bands is back and in a big way by your side is a great cd which conveys the southern rock and roll styles that has been sorely missed for the past few years this is true rock and roll at its finest if you enjoy aerosmith or the rolling stones i recommend this cd the first single kickin my heart around sums up what the crowes are about they might not have the most talent in the world but they are great at what they do rock hard a must hear.
this book taught that we can master more than one trade that we should invest in ourselves and be our own bosses that organization begins at home and more.
this is a marvelous book and an easy read even though ben franklin seemed to be just an average guy as you read about him accomplishing one thing after another you get a sense of his magnificence as a mani wish i had read this book when i was a kid perhaps a little of the diligence that is portrayed on every page would have rubbed off on methe autobiography is amazing in a low key ben franklin sort of way.
i had heard many different things about ben franklin one of the historical figures in the establishment of the united states this book confirmed some things i had heard and debunked some others good book.
this book was written to instruct and encourage young people men in those daysbut it can apply to anyone to live a simple and productive life franklin learned early the unpleasantness of being in debt and in trouble with others and made for himself a rule of life which he strove daily to adhere to he quickly learned that advice from others can be mistaken and the necessity of evaluating what others prescribed he gives a good account of a prudent life but does not spare himself clearly declaring when he was at fault or mistaken i wish i had read this when i was youngi might have been more consistent and productive.
dont believe we received this book could you verify where it was sent and whenwas this a kindle fire book.
i was hoping to really get in to this but it was to boring for me so that is why it is one star.
quite a well thought out book to take around with youbut limited use to me as there are no southern hemisphere maps or details even the southern cross is absentwould not have purchased it had i realised at least it was cheap.
the magic just isnt here anymore i think that every cramps fiends affection comes from the fact that these guys struggled through pretty much every kind of hardship a band can face except for a lack of purpose drive and motivation throughout the wild and wooly days of the early punk scene even the punks didnt get these guys this album is just too artificial sounding to be a real cramps album it sounds like a novelty album for kids i loved sinners though and for that i gave it another star.
you cannot search terms every time you try using kindle search it brings up on average over  pagesthis is not worth almost dollars for kindle version your better off with print the kindle is not designed to scroll pages quickly say like when your with friends.
this was one of the worst sci fi movies ever you have to turn the car off or the em pulse will fry it pretty sure it will still fry the electronics when its off probably wont kill you though the big army truck gets fried as do the guys in it and the good dr says it fried the the battery and starter he whips out his cute little red tool box and swaps the battery and alternator from their jeep liberty and the big diesel starts yeah right apparently the biggest nuclear bombs ever made are pretty light it only took four guys to load them into the truck how did they get them into the russian sub that just happened to be on the west coast an old russian diesel sub can make it to the bottom of the marianas trench  feet down really and the guy with the pacemaker why didnt the earlier em pulses fry his pacemaker these are just some of the gross abuses of reality there are many more dont bother unless you want something to laugh at in disbelief.
 star because it is messy but this is amazing ive used the freeze away crap and it doesnt work and is too expensive this is cheap and will work within two uses make sure you wrap the area tight though.
like many others i struggled for months with an inconveniently located wart on my finger i tried three  other kinds of retail removal products and i was thinking that perhaps i was just out of luck then i read through the reviews for this pedifix wart stick and was encouraged enough to try one more time the product arrived quickly and my wart friend is almost gone excellent.
after reading all the great reviews i was thinking that this stuff was really strong and going to work i was expecting to feel a light burning sensation so i could tell that it was working i tried using this several times and it did nothing i dont know if i just got a bad one because it looked like it was somewhat melted when i opened it too me i felt like i was putting chapstick on a wart and hoping it would work.
i purchased this product due to all the great reviews i have used this on my daughters leg for several weeks and still nothing my daughters leg looks to be rubbed raw but there has been no progress with her warts i am very disapointed with this medicine.
bought this to remove a wart weeks later of apply several times a dayminimal resultsi threw it away what a joke i did then buy trichloroacetic acid  and boomthe wart was gonemore expensive but cheaper than buying the freeze away over and over.
i had a bunch of plantars warts on my heel that had been there for a while and just kept multiplying i was under the impression that they had to be removed by a doctor until i saw this product i immediately ordered it and began using it religiously a couple weeks passed and i didnt see a change in the warts the skin around them wasnt looking so good but the warts were still thriving i read online that a lot of people have luck with apple cider vinegar so i tried that much better results forget this product just go to the store and get some acv cotton balls and duct tape.
purchased this product a few weeks ago for my tween son he started with one wart on his foot but soon others developed previously we were using dr sch for several weeks and it just had a minor effect on the warts so after some research i decided to give pedifix a shot it is working very effectively so far no pain at all when he applies it this is my st review written on amazon but not my st reading of reviews i glean a lot of info from reading and analyzing reviews i am glad i chose this product.
i think this item worked excellent compared to the other liquid based removers which seem to take forever to work my foot doctor recommended this to me and its hard to find in local stores it is stronger so watch you dont use too much because your skin will get irritated around the wart site one tip my dr gave me was to use a qtip to scoop some out and then apply to the wart that way you dont reinfect yourself i would definately purchase this again.
i got the wart stick for my grand daughter  yrs old she has a wart on her hand and foot but i was afraid to give it to her or my daughter because it looks just like chap stick and my grand daughter has a lot of little friendsso the stick is at the dumpthere for i dont know if it works or not.
this product was delivered promptly and efficiently within three days of ordering itdont like the scent anymore however i dont know if i have changed or if it is an old batch.
i thought its a score book just like the corrs  the corrs but i am totally wrong.
thefirst volume of gasarakireally surprised me it was well written and thoughtful trying to tell a deep story that was more about behind the scenes power plays than robot brawlsthis second disc continues to add new wrinkles and complications the war with belgistan comes to a close which surprised me as i thought it was going to run through the entire series and the jssdf forces prepare to pull out we learn about a secret organization calling itself symbol that was assisting belgistan though their motivations for doing so are still cloudedyushiro causes some commotion when he heads off base and winds up in the middle of a kidnapping we also see more of the mysterious girl from the first disc that seems to share yushiros powersvery little seems to happen episode by episode if the disc is watched straight through it is very satisfying viewing but i can see that if i were watching this half an hour at a time as it was broadcast it would have been tough to follow.
this film deserves the excellent reputation it has earned however the version i purchased international film series has white subtitles against white backgrounds only about  are fully readable other releases may have the same problem do not buy this unless you speak french.
i am an avid ps gamer i purchased this from a local store because of its apparent convenience was i ever wrong the device has a battery indicator on it with  bars when the batteries go down to  bars i have a very sporadic connection to my ps my ps is only ft away after a while of playing everquest online this became very annoying and inconvenient after a month i ditched this and bought a cable extender another expensive lesson .
we live in ak and so we thought we needed to find something to keep our toddler active while being cooped up during the winter our son loves itwe hate it it takes up almost the whole living roomthats not the bad part there is only a bottom in the large section the two medium section are open on the bottom so there are always balls everywhere we bought extra balls which you need but our house turns into a ball pit but we make it a game with our toddler to pick up the ballsbut warning you will be finding balls for days.
santa bought this for my then  month old for his first christmas he and his little friends just love playing in the tents and tunnells the cats do too i dont think you need to wait for age  as recommended i do wish it were a bit sturdier as a couple of the ties have torn already i highly recommend this product especially over the winter when it is wet and dreary hereit sits in our living room for oodles of fun.
i bought this for my youngest sons third birthday it is a great product both of my boys ages  and  love to play with it it is a good outside or inside toy but to use it outside there can not be much wind because it is very light and will blow around easily to use inside you do need lots of room it can be put together or taken apart in less than  minutes so it is a toy you can buy even if you dont have room to always leave it up i would recommend this toy to anyone it would be a great toy for a baby just learning to craw.
i think it is a hit or miss on this product i have a friend that has a playhut and it is fine we just opened ours and at least  seams are coming undone not sewn correctly there are a couple holes in the material  forgotten attachment loops and it is rather flimsy kids still like it though it isnt going to last too long.
i dont get what people like about this book lindsey is a fluid writer good describer but his characters spend way too much time in their own heads and the action in this book at least is predictable and rendered downright boring all the lurid details that are supposed to add to the psychoerotic nature of the book come off as crude and offputting instead like a geek at a sideshow biting the head off a chicken and anyone who cant guess the surprise twist by page  wasnt reading very closely.
although david lindsey has a talent for descriptive prose this book overall was a big disappointment to me he did not seem to have a clear idea how the plot would unravel and left too many loose ends each time i expected a new wrinkle to develop from a piece of evidence he didnt bother to tie it in i think its possible that he didnt even know how it would end until it did and at that point he was just tired of writing if you decide to read this book be prepared to see very ugly things with no redeeming human value and be prepared to be left wondering    what ever happened with the  .
my girls love this it looks great in their little play kitchen and it is educational as well i tried to reduce the poor quality plastic kitchen toys and use good quality products instead the shapes are easy to put together  they look realistic.
nice book not quite as good as i expected but had some really awesome photos ac.
pros great fun portablecons hard to read led except in darkness no off buttonas soon as i got this toy i started playing itbut then i found out that in bright light i could not see the led so i went in some shadenow thats just fine except theres no shade indoorsso i found a dull light and used itbut then i brushed the yesbutton and no button would turn it off so i had to play it thoughbut overall if you have a dull reading light and you are patient buy this product.
instead of being a better product this one is made cheaper and seems flimsy and doesnt respond like the older versions arent things supposed to get better this one is made in chinawhere all the leaded paint and computer things are being messed withsabatogedwish id gone into a store and looked at it held it this one is lighter  not good quality and the color is dark not the bright red or blue ive always usedseen and hard to read the text toowould have sent it back but for the shipping costs which ran up the price.
my    year olds love this game  and we have gotten it for all of their friends birthdays too they love trying to come up with items to stump the computer it keeps them busy and gets them thinking.
my wife and son play the game almost everyday after dinner or at breakfast on weekends its fun to think of an object q is not very accurate at guessing abstract things and answer its astute questions and it usually gets it right sometimes it has to go on to  questions though kind of spooky that a decent database and algorithm can fit in such a small device highly recommended.
this is where it all started for many kelly fans its wonderful stuffpauls lyrics on this album are pure working class poetry the musical style is unashamedly lustyboy pubband unsynthesised i remember when music was real and relentlessly cheerful every tune on this album is catchy and even the dark ones are uplifting dumb things was the anthem for pregenx postbabyboom lost souls kelly has honed his lyrical ability since those early days but his story telling has always been strongunder the sun is unmistakably australian more so than on later albums this is particularly obvious on forty miles to saturday night and to her door when kelly writes about things australian he gets it right there is emotional truth in the detail here and the music is damn good kelly deserves his status as an australian workingclass antihero cb.
the music on this set is fine as ms day always is however it has a quirk i find distasteful on the third cd is a hidden track track  to be exact that throws all the songs out of sequence if you rip it i wouldnt recommend buying this for that reason alone all the songs are available on other cds so its no problem skipping over this one it seems if they want to mess with people and keep it a secret until after the money is spent then my money will be spent elsewhere.
the book is not bad the most valuable sections of this book include topics of structureprocessoutcome sometimes cognitive learning values culture goals working with tools and communication the diagrams and tables in this book are almost not helpful at al.
this antenna may work for some people but for me it was another regrettable purchase the assembly is fairly easy but the results proved a letdown i bought the terk in hopes it would work perfectly with the samsung dtbhf set top box i am using to bring in free ota digital and hd stations but i tried two different positions with the terk and its db amp was only able to bring in three or four local dt stations at best analog reception proved even worse when i took off the terk and replaced it with a coventionallydesigned less expensive indoor antenna with a db amp in those same positions the difference in performance was amazingi could get between  and  dt channels in conclusion my advice is to avoid the hype about unusual antenna design and go for maximum decibel amplification its that extra power that made the difference for me sorry terk.
this is far and away the best book ive found on vbnet it is well written and offers excellent perspective on vbnet and net framework with enough detail so that the reader together with some handson experience will have a good depth of knowledge when hes finished highly recommended.
bought the book over a month ago and totally disagree with a lot of the reviews onlin.
i purchased this book for my husband who worked for a couple of weeks in trinidad he was not able to buy a cookbook while therei searched amazon and bought the one and only trindad cookbook and it was a winner he was very pleased that the recipes were for a lot of the food that he experienced.
this book is an amazing story of a young girl growing up in poverty in new york city the vividness of the images the developing of the characters betty smith is a master at her art francie and her family come alive in this book ive read it over and over and i still love it i would recommend it for anyone from high level th grade readers to elderly people what an amazing story.
a tree grows in brooklyn  is a very touching novel it takes place in the s and tells what life is like growing up back then  with all of the obstacles that come along the way francis is the main character of the book who grows up along with the trees in brooklynshe grows up in a poor family and struggles to fit in and find friends however that does not bring her down francis is still a very happy and cheerful person regardless of what other people may try to tell her she loves to read and since she doesnt have many friends she feels and makes her books her friends when betty smith wrote this book she looked back on her life and the experiences she had and put some of them in her book it is written not only for teenagers or adults but anyone who wants to read about the thrill of growing up if you miss a tree grows in brooklyn you are missing a truly great novel.
francie is a girl who is dirt poor and living in brooklyn during harsh times francie is strong through the horrible things that happen to her during the course of her life i cried i laughed and i felt the pain that francie felt francie also deals with the tradgedy of her fathers death not to mention almost being raped this book also deals with a girl becoming a woman a must read book.
i give this book three thumbs up it is poinent funny sad romantic and scary all at the same time it is a classic that will keep readers on their toes for a million years.
i have read  a tree grows in brooklyn over and over againwhen things in my own life seem too difficulti read about the life of francie nolan and realize i can overcome any problem with the same determination that francie and her family had all the characters were goodfrom the strongwilled motherthe weak dreamer of a father to the loving but promiscuous aunt francie was my favorite character of allshe was able to overcome the adversity in her life through sheer dtermination and the gift of learning she learned from everyone around her and the harsh enviroment in which she lived i would recommend this book anyone who likes coming of age storiesi have read a tree growsi have read a tree growsi have read a tree growsin.
this book has so many pearls of wisdom its very simply written so do not expect this to be a typical nyt bestseller like the one you read last week i believe this book was written in the s and although much of the vernacular in the book is obviously of a different period in time it has a timeless and universal appeal i havent even finished it yet but have already decided enough with the library version i want my own copy so that i can use the advice it offers later on in life dont miss this one and make sure you tell your friends about it so that they can come and thank you later and you can say i told you so.
i recently read this book for my english class at school i have enjoyed every other book we have been required to rea.
