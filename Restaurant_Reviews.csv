251,251,-1,there is nothing privileged about workingeating there

341,341,1,of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great
342,342,1,the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai

352,352,1,everyone is treated equally special
353,353,-1,it shouldnt take  min for pancakes and eggs
354,354,1,it was delicious

358,358,1,best fish ive ever had in my life
359,359,1,the bathroom is just next door and very nice
360,360,-1,the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland

362,362,1,pretty cool i would say
363,363,-1,definitely a turn off for me  i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying
364,364,1,server did a great job handling our large rowdy table
365,365,-1,i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food

374,374,-1,and the beans and rice were mediocre at best
375,375,1,best tacos in town by far
376,376,-1,i took back my money and got outta there
377,377,1,in an interesting part of town this place is amazing
378,378,-1,rude  inconsiderate management

392,392,1,i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great
393,393,1,we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience
394,394,1,service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria
395,395,1,to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser
396,396,-1,im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it
397,397,1,kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos
398,398,1,service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see
399,399,1,cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable
400,400,-1,this one is simply a disappointment
401,401,-1,overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon
402,402,-1,i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed
403,403,1,great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area
404,404,1,today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible

417,417,1,i really enjoyed eating here
418,418,1,first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular
419,419,1,our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end
420,420,1,from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste
421,421,-1,on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop
422,422,-1,furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website
423,423,-1,weve tried to like this place but after  times i think were done with them
424,424,-1,what a mistake that was
425,425,1,no complaints
426,426,1,this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic
427,427,-1,waiter was a jerk

431,431,1,we loved the biscuits
432,432,1,service is quick and friendly
433,433,-1,ordered an appetizer and took  minutes and then the pizza another  minutes
434,434,1,so absolutley fantastic
435,435,-1,it was a huge awkward lb piece of cow that was ths gristle and fat
436,436,1,definitely will come back here again
437,437,1,i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar
438,438,1,wow very spicy but delicious

440,440,-1,ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere
441,441,1,id love to go back
442,442,1,anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch
443,443,-1,nothing special
444,444,1,each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious
445,445,1,not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner
446,446,-1,will not be back
447,447,-1,sauce was tasteless
448,448,1,the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way
449,449,1,my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor
450,450,-1,i dont think well be going back anytime soon
451,451,1,food was so gooodd
452,452,-1,i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food
453,453,-1,i was so insulted
454,454,-1,the last  times i had lunch here has been bad
455,455,-1,the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten
456,456,1,the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc
457,457,1,nargile  i think you are great
458,458,1,best tater tots in the southwest
459,459,1,we loved the place
460,460,-1,definitely not worth the  i paid
461,461,1,the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough
462,462,1,im in az all the time and now have my new spot
463,463,-1,the manager was the worst
464,464,1,the inside is really quite nice and very clean
465,465,1,the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable
466,466,-1,i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food
467,467,-1,this is was due to the fact that it took  minutes to be acknowledged then another  minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things
468,468,1,love the margaritas too
469,469,1,this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint
470,470,1,very good though

472,472,1,great pork sandwich
473,473,-1,dont waste your time here
474,474,-1,total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee
475,475,-1,third the cheese on my friends burger was cold
476,476,1,we enjoy their pizza and brunch
477,477,1,the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked
478,478,1,we had a group of  when we claimed we would only have  and they handled us beautifully
479,479,1,i loved it
480,480,-1,we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either
481,481,1,this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here
482,482,-1,seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh
483,483,-1,the selection of food was not the best
484,484,1,delicious and i will absolutely be back
485,485,1,this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment
486,486,1,they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle
487,487,-1,i dont think i will be back for a very long time
488,488,-1,it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign
489,489,1,how awesome is that
490,490,1,i will be back many times soon
491,491,1,the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide
492,492,-1,worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings
493,493,1,conclusion very filling meals
494,494,1,their daily specials are always a hit with my group
495,495,-1,and then tragedy struck
496,496,1,the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that
497,497,1,this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious
498,498,1,their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite
499,499,1,waitress was sweet and funny

519,519,1,point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed
520,520,1,oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant
521,521,1,if you havent gone here go now
522,522,-1,a greasy unhealthy meal
523,523,-1,first time there and might just be the last
524,524,1,those burgers were amazing
525,525,-1,similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was  minutes late
526,526,-1,and it was way to expensive
527,527,1,be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo  the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for
528,528,1,this was my first time and i cant wait until the next
529,529,1,the bartender was also nice
530,530,1,everything was good and tasty
531,531,1,this place is two thumbs upway up
532,532,1,the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun
533,533,1,if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place
534,534,-1,terrible management

536,536,-1,if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars
537,537,1,great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts
538,538,-1,worst martini ever
539,539,1,the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc
540,540,1,i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas
541,541,-1,we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were  vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting
542,542,1,the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh
543,543,-1,i wont try going back there even if its empty

545,545,1,just spicy enough perfect actually

547,547,-1,not even a hello we will be right with you
548,548,-1,the desserts were a bit strange
549,549,1,my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service
550,550,1,i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place
551,551,1,nice ambiance
552,552,1,i would recommend saving room for this
553,553,-1,i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful
554,554,-1,however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good
555,555,-1,i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here
556,556,-1,avoid this establishment
557,557,-1,i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough
558,558,1,all of the tapas dishes were delicious
559,559,1,i heart this place
560,560,-1,my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm
561,561,-1,after two i felt disgusting
562,562,1,a good time
563,563,1,i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi
564,564,1,generous portions and great taste
565,565,-1,i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone
566,566,-1,the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped
567,567,1,food was delicious
568,568,-1,an hour seriously
569,569,-1,i consider this theft
570,570,-1,eew this location needs a complete overhaul

574,574,1,our server was super nice and checked on us many times
575,575,-1,the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way
576,576,-1,i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed

579,579,1,as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks
580,580,-1,boy was that sucker dry
581,581,-1,over rated
582,582,-1,if you look for authentic thai food go else where
583,583,1,their steaks are  recommended
584,584,-1,after i pulled up my car i waited for another  minutes before being acknowledged
585,585,1,great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting
586,586,1,all in all i can assure you ill be back
587,587,-1,i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives
588,588,1,my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of  giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar
589,589,-1,the kids play area is nasty
590,590,1,great place fo take out or eat in
591,591,1,the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options
592,592,1,omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish
593,593,-1,it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless
594,594,-1,it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor
595,595,1,the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus
596,596,-1,i got home to see the driest damn wings ever
597,597,1,itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix
598,598,1,i really enjoyed crema caf before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast
599,599,-1,not good for the money
600,600,1,i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia
601,601,-1,we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting  minutes just to place our order another  minutes before the food arrived

609,609,-1,i will not be eating there again
610,610,-1,the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one
611,611,-1,i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed
612,612,-1,the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy
613,613,-1,sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 
614,614,1,an absolute must visit
615,615,1,the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing
616,616,-1,my friend did not like his bloody mary
617,617,-1,despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a  star
618,618,1,they really want to make your experience a good one
619,619,-1,i will not return
620,620,-1,i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland
621,621,-1,very disappointing
622,622,1,the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning
623,623,-1,a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait
624,624,1,pretty awesome place
625,625,1,ambience is perfect
626,626,-1,best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management
627,627,-1,any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one
628,628,-1,i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself
629,629,1,the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby
630,630,1,four stars for the food  the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe  still letting us in to eat 
631,631,1,the roast beef sandwich tasted really good
632,632,-1,same evening him and i are both drastically sick
633,633,1,highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad
634,634,-1,ordered burger rare came in well done
635,635,1,we were promptly greeted and seated
636,636,-1,tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse
637,637,1,i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable
638,638,-1,after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods
639,639,1,this is a good joint
640,640,1,the macarons here are insanely good
641,641,-1,im not eating here
642,642,1,our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative

644,644,-1,this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver
645,645,-1,very bad experience
646,646,-1,what a mistake
647,647,-1,food was average at best
648,648,1,great food
649,649,-1,we wont be going back anytime soon
650,650,-1,very very disappointed ordered the  big bay plater
651,651,1,great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer
652,652,1,it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends
653,653,-1,not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed
654,654,1,the patio seating was very comfortable
655,655,-1,the fried rice was dry as well
656,656,1,hands down my favorite italian restaurant
657,657,1,that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas
658,658,1,it was just not a fun experience
659,659,1,the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested
660,660,1,i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant
661,661,1,very convenient since we were staying at the mgm
662,662,1,the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous
663,663,1,both great
664,664,1,eclectic selection
665,665,1,the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had
666,666,1,the staff was very attentive
667,667,1,and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him
668,668,1,the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price
669,669,-1,google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up
670,670,-1,dont go here
671,671,1,i promise they wont disappoint

679,679,-1,service was slow and not attentive
680,680,1,i gave it  stars then and im giving it  stars now
681,681,-1,your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me
682,682,1,dessert panna cotta was amazing
683,683,1,very good food great atmosphere
684,684,1,damn good steak
685,685,-1,total brunch fail
686,686,1,prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo

728,728,1,the han nan chicken was also very tasty
729,729,1,as for the service i thought it was good

744,744,-1,will not be back
745,745,1,there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat
746,746,1,an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast
747,747,1,i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from
748,748,-1,i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly
749,749,1,wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside
750,750,1,i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette
751,751,1,the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth
752,752,1,level  spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup
753,753,1,we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic
754,754,-1,main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid s and up
755,755,1,when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again
756,756,-1,i had to wait over  minutes to get my drink and longer to get  arepas

766,766,1,one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 
767,767,1,the block was amazing
768,768,1,its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food
769,769,1, both the hot  sour  the egg flower soups were absolutely  stars

773,773,-1,what did bother me was the slow service
774,774,1,the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing
775,775,-1,their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste
776,776,1,these were so good we ordered them twice
777,777,-1,so in a nutshell  the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer
778,778,-1,my girlfriends veal was very bad
779,779,-1,unfortunately it was not good
780,780,1,i had a pretty satifying experience

782,782,1,perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder
783,783,-1,bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat
784,784,-1,the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily
785,785,1,the nachos are a must have
786,786,-1,we will not be coming back
787,787,1,i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well
788,788,1,the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff
789,789,1,great atmosphere friendly and fast service
790,790,1,when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there
791,791,-1,once your food arrives its meh
792,792,-1,paying  for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal
793,793,1,the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic
794,794,-1,my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too
795,795,1,so good i am going to have to review this place twice  once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night

803,803,1,this place was such a nice surprise
804,804,1,they were goldencrispy and delicious
805,805,-1,i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat
806,806,1,i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine
807,807,-1,not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food
808,808,1,lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered
809,809,1,the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was
810,810,-1,the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place
811,811,-1,the service was terrible though
812,812,-1,this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced
813,813,-1,it was packed
814,814,1,i love this place
815,815,1,i can say that the desserts were yummy
816,816,-1,the food was terrible
817,817,1,the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree
818,818,-1,it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done
819,819,-1,this place should honestly be blown up
820,820,-1,but i definitely would not eat here again
821,821,-1,do not waste your money here
822,822,1,i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes
823,823,1,the crpe was delicate and thin and moist
824,824,-1,awful service
825,825,-1,wont ever go here again
826,826,-1,food quality has been horrible
827,827,-1,for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone
828,828,-1,the service here is fair at best
829,829,-1,i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices
830,830,-1,do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish
831,831,-1,very poor service
832,832,-1,no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it
833,833,1,best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day
834,834,1,they were excellent
835,835,-1,i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job
836,836,1,just had lunch here and had a great experience
837,837,-1,i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor
838,838,-1,food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small
839,839,1,i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since
840,840,-1,for  bucks a head i really expect better food
841,841,1,the food came out at a good pace
842,842,1,i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad
843,843,-1,i wont be back
844,844,-1,we could not believe how dirty the oysters were
845,845,-1,this place deserves no stars
846,846,-1,i would not recommend this place
847,847,1,in fact im going to round up to  stars just because she was so awesome
848,848,-1,to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted
849,849,-1,bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise
850,850,1,the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit
851,851,-1,i probably would not go here again
852,852,1,so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat
853,853,1,the price is reasonable and the service is great
854,854,-1,the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either
855,855,-1,my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing
856,856,1,went in for happy hour great list of wines
857,857,1,some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot
858,858,-1,i probably wont be coming back here
859,859,-1,worst foodservice ive had in a while
860,860,1,this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant
861,861,1,talk about great customer service of course we will be back
862,862,-1,hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil
863,863,1,i love their fries and their beans
864,864,1,always a pleasure dealing with him
865,865,1,they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval
866,866,1,this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer
867,867,1,for sushi on the strip this is the place to go
868,868,1,the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table
869,869,-1,the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best
870,870,-1,i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one
871,871,-1,this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos
872,872,1,all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting
873,873,1,my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience
874,874,-1,weird vibe from owners
875,875,-1,there was hardly any meat
876,876,-1,ive had better bagels from the grocery store
877,877,1,go to place for gyros
878,878,1,i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude
879,879,-1,now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless
880,880,-1,i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa
881,881,-1,the service was terrible food was mediocre
882,882,1,we definately enjoyed ourselves
883,883,-1,i ordered albondigas soup  which was just warm  and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs
884,884,-1,on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate
885,885,-1,i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore
886,886,-1,the service was extremely slow
887,887,-1,after  minutes wait i got a table
888,888,1,seriously killer hot chai latte
889,889,-1,no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts
890,890,1,my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love
891,891,1,their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place
892,892,-1,pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom
893,893,-1,worst thai ever
894,894,1,if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once
895,895,1,i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service
896,896,1,the pizza selections are good
897,897,1,i had strawberry tea which was good
898,898,-1,highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron
899,899,1,overall a great experience
900,900,-1,spend your money elsewhere
901,901,1,their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm
902,902,-1,the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated
903,903,-1,and the drinks are weak people
904,904,-1,my order was not correct
905,905,-1,also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house
906,906,-1,after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert
907,907,1,the chips and sals a here is amazing
908,908,-1,we wont be returning
909,909,1,this is my new fav vegas buffet spot
910,910,-1,i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off
911,911,-1,very very sad
912,912,-1,i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that
913,913,-1,how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand
914,914,-1,im not impressed with the concept or the food
915,915,-1,the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it pured
916,916,-1,there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better
917,917,-1,i got food poisoning here at the buffet
918,918,-1,they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no
919,919,-1,what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us
920,920,-1,needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon
921,921,-1,this place is disgusting
922,922,1,every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree
923,923,-1,the ri style calamari was a joke
924,924,-1,however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible
925,925,-1,i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch
926,926,-1,it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it
927,927,-1,it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it
928,928,-1,we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one
929,929,-1,disappointing experience
930,930,-1,the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all
931,931,-1,if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you
932,932,-1,waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying
933,933,-1,we wont be going back
934,934,-1,the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it
935,935,-1,this place lacked style
936,936,-1,the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was  ridiculous
937,937,-1,dont bother coming here
938,938,-1,the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork
939,939,-1,the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again
940,940,-1,it was equally awful
941,941,-1,probably not in a hurry to go back
942,942,-1,very slow at seating even with reservation
943,943,-1,not good by any stretch of the imagination
944,944,-1,the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked
945,945,-1,the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat
946,946,-1,it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor
947,947,-1,i was very disappointed
948,948,-1,this place is horrible and way overpriced
949,949,-1,maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best
950,950,-1,it wasnt busy at all and now we know why
951,951,-1,the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu
952,952,-1,the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits
953,953,-1,con spotty service
954,954,-1,the fries were not hot and neither was my burger
955,955,-1,but then they came back cold
956,956,-1,then our food came out disappointment ensued
957,957,-1,the real disappointment was our waiter
958,958,-1,my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything
959,959,-1,the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach
960,960,-1,insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it
961,961,-1,if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart
962,962,-1,she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door
963,963,-1,after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment
964,964,-1,del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible
965,965,-1,its not hard to make a decent hamburger
966,966,-1,but i dont like it
967,967,-1,hell no will i go back
968,968,-1,weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant
969,969,-1,i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall
970,970,-1,i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar
971,971,-1,the ambiance isnt much better
972,972,-1,unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees
973,973,-1,the food wasnt good
974,974,-1,your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked
975,975,-1,what happened next was prettyoff putting
976,976,-1,too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place
977,977,-1,overpriced for what you are getting
978,978,-1,i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch
979,979,-1,i kept looking at the time and it had soon become  minutes yet still no food
980,980,-1,i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list
981,981,-1,we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh
982,982,-1,food was below average
983,983,-1,it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant
984,984,-1,all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop
985,985,-1,the problem i have is that they charge  for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables
986,986,-1,shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only  a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold
987,987,-1,it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry
988,988,-1,it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down
989,989,-1,i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage
990,990,-1,the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland
991,991,-1,spend your money and time some place else
992,992,-1,a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad
993,993,-1,the presentation of the food was awful
994,994,-1,i cant tell you how disappointed i was
995,995,-1,i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking
996,996,-1,appetite instantly gone
997,997,-1,overall i was not impressed and would not go back
998,998,-1,the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time
999,999,-1,then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check
