251,-1,There is nothing privileged about workingeating there

315,-1,The bus boy on the other hand was so rude
316,-1,By this point my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known
317,1,Back to good BBQ lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways
318,1,And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about  you just cant go wrong

320,-1,The only downside is the service
321,-1,Also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries Ive ever had

390,1,If you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place
391,1,I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night  highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area
392,1,I have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great
393,1,We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience
394,1,Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria
395,1,To summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser
396,-1,Im probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it
397,1,Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos

419,1,Our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end
420,1,From what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste
421,-1,On the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop
422,-1,Furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website

447,-1,Sauce was tasteless
448,1,The food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way

450,-1,I dont think well be going back anytime soon

465,1,The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable

470,1,Very good though

619,-1,I will not return
620,-1,I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland
621,-1,Very disappointing
622,1,The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning

624,1,Pretty awesome place
625,1,Ambience is perfect
626,-1,Best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management
627,-1,Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one

743,-1,When I opened the sandwich I was impressed but not in a good way
744,-1,Will not be back
745,1,There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat
746,1,An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast
747,1,I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from
748,-1,I have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly
749,1,Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside
750,1,I got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette
751,1,The wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth
752,1,Level  spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup
753,1,We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC

763,-1,But the service was beyond bad
764,1,Im so happy to be here
765,-1,Tasted like dirt
766,1,One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again 
767,1,The block was amazing
768,1,Its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food
769,1, Both the Hot  Sour  the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely  Stars
770,-1,My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless
771,1,Great time  family dinner on a Sunday night
772,-1,the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional Hunan style
773,-1,What did bother me was the slow service
774,1,The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing
775,-1,Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste
776,1,These were so good we ordered them twice
777,-1,So in a nutshell  The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer
778,-1,My girlfriends veal was very bad
779,-1,Unfortunately it was not good
780,1,I had a pretty satifying experience
781,1,Join the club and get awesome offers via email
782,1,Perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder
783,-1,Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat
784,-1,The chains which Im no fan of beat this place easily

786,-1,We will not be coming back
787,1,I dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well
788,1,The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff
789,1,Great atmosphere friendly and fast service
790,1,When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there
791,-1,Once your food arrives its meh
792,-1,Paying  for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal
793,1,The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic
794,-1,My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too
795,1,So good I am going to have to review this place twice  once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night

802,-1,Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked
803,1,This place was such a nice surprise
804,1,They were goldencrispy and delicious
805,-1,I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat
806,1,I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine
807,-1,Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food
808,1,Lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered
809,1,The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience I still tell people how awesome the duck was
810,-1,The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome I would not suggest this place
811,-1,The service was terrible though
812,-1,This place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is OVERPRICED
813,-1,It was packed
814,1,I love this place

951,-1,The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu
952,-1,The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits
953,-1,Con spotty service
954,-1,The fries were not hot and neither was my burger
955,-1,But then they came back cold

957,-1,The real disappointment was our waiter
958,-1,My husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything
959,-1,The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach
960,-1,Insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it
961,-1,If someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart

979,-1,I kept looking at the time and it had soon become  minutes yet still no food
980,-1,I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to and this tops the list
981,-1,We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh
982,-1,Food was below average
983,-1,It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant
984,-1,All in all Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop
985,-1,The problem I have is that they charge  for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables
986,-1,Shrimp When I unwrapped it I live only  a mile from Brushfire it was literally ice cold
987,-1,It lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry
988,-1,It really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down
989,-1,I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage
990,-1,The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland
991,-1,Spend your money and time some place else
992,-1,A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad
993,-1,the presentation of the food was awful
994,-1,I cant tell you how disappointed I was
995,-1,I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking
996,-1,Appetite instantly gone
997,-1,Overall I was not impressed and would not go back
998,-1,The whole experience was underwhelming and I think well just go to Ninja Sushi next time
999,-1,Then as if I hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check
