i wholeheartedly agree with mike k  for your money this is a great deal in charlotte the dowd y is a very nice gym that offers a bevy of group fitness classes up to date and always functioning equipment and a super clean atmosphere   why i love this y in particularthe machines are always in service and ive head that techs are out fixing them weekly if need be they also do not allow any children under the age of  in the workout areas now dont get me wrong i love kids just not when im trying to get my sweat on   as mentioned before this y offers so many great group classes im a big fan of total strength pilates mat and kickboxing ive also heard the spin classes are great ive tried athletic conditioning and while it certainly is an awesome workout make sure youre at least in decent shape before you partake in that class its a rough one   as other reviewers have noted this gym can get packed especially after  pm during the weekdays so be patient while parking some classes can get a bit crowded too so keep that in mind when youre sprawling out your mat or equipment   i havent had any issues with theft in the locker room but im a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker for the money and the friendly service the dowd ymca is a great deal for anyone looking to slim down or tone up
