i have visited harpers a few times in the past two years the restaurant is clean and inviting the atmosphere is warm and personable which is nice for couples and families  but with each experience i am less impressed the food is good however there are better places to dine within the southpark area the food is moderately priced but is too much for what you get my last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu the offerings are scarce for a restaurant with a nonspecific specialty im not big on chain restaurants but i would have been happier visiting the cheesecake factory located across the street from harpers which has many more menu options  i am sad to say that i will not visit again unless an executive group decision is made to dine here
