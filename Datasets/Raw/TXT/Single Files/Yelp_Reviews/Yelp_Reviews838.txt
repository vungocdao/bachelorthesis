watched a suns game here recently and had a blast  the arena is in the heart of downtown phoenix and is near bars and restaurants  its really easy to have a pre and postgame party  we walked to lucky strikes after the game and had a few drinks and shot some pool  overall its a good time in this arena  return factor
