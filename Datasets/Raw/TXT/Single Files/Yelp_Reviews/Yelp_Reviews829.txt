alice cooperstown is as my husband said like a hard rock thats not stupid  the concept is a bizarre combo of alice cooper and a sports bar  and it works    we stopped by two other places to check out their menus before a game and they didnt look very thrilling  the menu at cooperstown is pretty extensive  lots of options    the service was very quick and efficient  i see no reason to go anywhere else before a dbacks game
