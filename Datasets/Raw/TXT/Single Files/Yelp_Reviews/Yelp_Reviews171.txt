if you were to base  cees as a restaurant it definitely will get one star   however this place is known as a grease spoon dive  that is exactly what it is and by far the very best dive diner that i have ever been too           jeanie is great  she will be your greeter your hostess your waitresses your personal cook your bus person and your cashier  whew  jeanie is not a jeannie in a bottle she cannot snap her fingers so that your meal magically will appear in front of you  she is the only person that i have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food   her cooking area is quite small  trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it   jeanie does swear like a sailor but in a quiet mild manner and not like a raging lunatic  when you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth    trust me i  hate it with a passion when people swear but with jeanie it is okay   but with jeanie you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force  however while jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and sweet heart  she will make your order the way you want it  beware  the portions are huge   the coffee is endless the prices are very reasonable    so why only four stars when it should really be a five  well as i mention jeanies swearing like a sailor is part of the  cees experience  i can deal with hearing damn mf shit  etc  i cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words  when people say jesus christ name or god followed by the d word i get upset
