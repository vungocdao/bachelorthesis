okso we went to the zoo this past saturday and just our luck it was the busiest day of the year so far according to one of the workers  we had a wonderful time until we got to the paddle boat area and had a horrible customer service experience with an employee named zach  we tooled around in the paddle boat for our  minute ride and upon leaving went to pick up our  deposit  as we approached the desk zach raised his voice and said you will not be receiving your deposit back because you broke the rules and let your daughter sit in an area that is off limits on the boat we had no idea what this kid was talking about  he again raised his voice and people started to starehe said you signed a contract that said she wasnt allowed to sit in the middle of the boat  you made a decision to break their rules and therefore have lost your deposit  wow  all i can say is if this is such a dire safety issue why not tell people when they get in the boat  so ridiculous and quite the scam to keep our   they even had devised a hand signal so the person at the cash register would know not to give our money to us  the most curious thing to us was why didnt they just tell us to have her move over while we were in the boat  they never mentioned it to us  it seriously ruined our trip  zach you really take your job way too seriously dude  oh and i stopped payment on my debit cardtake that
