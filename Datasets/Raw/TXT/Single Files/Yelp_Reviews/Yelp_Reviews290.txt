run to alexander michaels this christmas season for dinner or drinks  you will thank me     tucked away in th ward which in and of itself is reason enough to head to am it is quaint and right now decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights i love twinkly things  it truly looks out of a movie  and the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly  a little bit magical    i was a th ward resident and kinda lived at am for a few years and had not been in awhile  we went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my alltime favorite venues the fillmore but i digress  great beer selection  we all had different meals nachos are delish salsa not so much my hubs said the burger was good fried pickles yum veggie pita was great but you have to get the what it is  what it is sustained me for years  im veggie now so no chicken for me but it was good all those nights  while the food is not star worthy the atmosphere the bar the beer selection the people and the staff make this a star establishment for sure
