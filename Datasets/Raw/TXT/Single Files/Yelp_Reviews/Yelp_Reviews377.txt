when parking uptown they are really your only option  which is fine as some of their lots have reasonable rates  my reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing and their overall customer service  my main problem with them aside from rude people is that there is no way to update your payment information online  my credit card was cancelled and upon receiving my new card midmarch i called immediately to update my information so come april they would have updated information  obviously i would have much rather done this all online but alas there was no other option but to call  they assured me that the new card was placed on file and we were good to go  fast forward to april th and i receive an email saying that my card did not go through and i would be fined an additional   they had charged the wrong card  they sent me this email on saturday afternoon and i immediately called only to be told that the people who handle payments dont work on weekends and i would need to call back during business hours the girl could have been a lot nicer  i call first thing monday morning and explain what happennot in an accusing tone by any means because im well aware that the likelihood of the girl i was speaking to having made this mistake was slim so why yell at the messenger  she immediately responded in a defensive tone saying there is no way that error could have occurred and it was my fault for not giving them the new information  i tried to explain again the course of events and she would not have it  she updated my credit card information now for the second time so lets see if it goes through for may  overall here is how i feel  tremendous amount of parking options offered in uptown poor customer service poor user experience overpriced  if youre going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year at least give me decent people  and if you dont give me decent people then give me a way to do what i need to do online so i dont have to deal with them
