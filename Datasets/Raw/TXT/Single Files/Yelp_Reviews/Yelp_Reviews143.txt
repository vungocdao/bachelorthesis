after two visits to this theater this week i want to yellp  turn up the volume or seriously look into purchasing new audio equipment easier said than done i know i felt as though i could hear every movement of audience members and the sound of crunching popcorn made me laugh out loud for some reason but the point is that i was distracted and did not at all feel immersed in the wonderful film in view
