my review is for the bakery  did you know safeway has a delicious carrot cake  i ordered a half sheet for an office function  i arrive at safeway and the cake is not ready  the lady who took my order failed to write down what kind of cake i wanted minus the onestar  the young woman who ended up helping me was very concerned and apologetic  she was able to decorate a carrot cake for me farily quickly and did a wonderful job  very refreshing to see that some people still take pride in doing a good job
