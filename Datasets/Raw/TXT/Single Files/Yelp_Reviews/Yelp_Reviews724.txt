seeing how little went into my quesadilla im not comfortable with paying over  at least use a mixed cheese blend  and seeing how little effort went into making my quesadilla i am really not impressed you would think a labor charge is rolled into the price of food  maybe what distinguishes qdoba are the burritos with their special combos but i am nonplussed to try them again oh well
