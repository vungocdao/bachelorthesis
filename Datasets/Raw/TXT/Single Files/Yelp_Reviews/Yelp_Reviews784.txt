this review is not a review of the store but of att wireless service in general  att is the worst wireless service ive ever had  i have more dropped calls and less bars in more places than any other carrier ive had and ive had verizon tmobile the best and now att  i would have never switched service if i didnt have to in order to get my iphone  and for the record  the iphone is the best object ive ever owned  i recommend you avoid att wireless at all costs unless you want the best phone in the world only then is it worth it
