there were  of us on a beautiful sunday afternoon surprisingly rolands was  full with  waitresses they were running to fill orders  the fish was hot and crispy it was fried but it was good the french fries with it tasted as if they were fried in the same grease or an oil that shouldve been changed several days ago  the mussels were ok  but the clams casino were inedible the clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping the crab cakes were also bad both went back  the waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine  the new england clam chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup  no we wont go backthe food was lacklusterbetter fix at wholleys and the service was terrible it took  minutes to get someone to take the bill
