while there were no insect carcasses in my food i was still not very impressed with my meal at pf changs  i went for a business lunch with my boss  who thought i would ever enjoy working more than eatingi think this meal was a first  i got steamed veggies and brown rice  now i expected it to be pretty bland since it mentioned no sauces added at all  but the vegetables were rubbery not crisp like they should be after a good steaming the rice was pretty underdone as well so allinall they got nothing right  i tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit but it was too little too late  perhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup  i usually add pepper to mine because i like the extra kick but this needed much more help than a little pepper  it was very bland and didnt taste like anything  tasteless egg in water is definitely not something you want to keep eating  and of course there was no salt and pepper on the table so i couldnt even enjoy it the way i like   because i didnt pay i didnt complain to the waiter but normally this would not have passed by me  though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable i still would not return here if given the choice
