there are much better choices in uptown charlotte  let me start with the goodthe front desk staff the three people who assisted me at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful great customer service  now the badstains there is no other way to describe everything in my room multiple stains on the carpeting and the comforter the bathrobe hanging on the back of the bathroom door had a huge brown stain on the sleeve that i kept telling myself was makeup from the last occupant every yes every bath towel had a stain either black or yellow there was stained grout behind the toilet like it had leaked sometime in the past even the shower curtain was stained then there was the hair dryer it was sooooo sticky that i didnt even want to touch it it appeared to be covered in about  years worth of cheap hairspray   i can appreciate that the hotel is getting older and may need a renovation soon but come on people  how about you splurge and replace your bath towels and hair dryers now    let me be clear that i think the cleaning staff is doing the best they can with what they have been given they just need a better starting product
