woah thank goodness for yelp thats how i learned about this breakfast gem the boy just moved to pa so we went out foraging for breakfast but before i did i did a quick yelp search we headed to pamelas as soon as i saw the reviews   there were about  people hovering outside so went in to put our name down heres my only complaint we waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down but then about  people just cut in front of the line which was a bit rude   the seating is tight but the atmosphere dineresque upon the walls are some differing varieties of art some for sale no less   the menu while not particularly healthconscious was heavy on eggs and pancakes we went with the specialty pancakes bananawalnut and choc chip  both were delicious i really wanted to and tried to finish mine but i just couldnt man up   the other complaint which is of nofault of the restaurant was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene despite the deliciousness of the food things got tense for a while   i think the next time i have a serious pankcakehankering ill find myself wishing boston had a pamelas
