the lobster bisque is amazing i do agree however anything above and beyond the bar takes acts of congress to get right the server took it upon himself to assume i wanted a side portion instead of a dinner portion of a salad at dinner time weird it takes forever to get another beer heaven forbid your thirsty on a bad day lastly by the time my husband was able to grab the attention of said server for katsup and mustard his burger it was cold and my salad had yet to arrive hence the extra time to sip on my late beer waiting for dinner i would say there are better more collected establishments in the area wait as i hear the second ring from the kitchen for the salad that i can see from the window but can not have
