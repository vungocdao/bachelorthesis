wow i have been going to this practice for  years i have had some troubles with them in the past but this is the kicker of them all i just called and explained to the person at the front desk that i have been having some breast pain and didnt know if i should come in earlier than my oct st  well woman exam her response was well if you come in early you will have to pay for an office visit i said well if i wait ill just talk to her about it at my well woman her reply if you talk to her about it then then you will be charged extra my reply just for talking about it her reply yup i dont know what to tell you just go to your primary care physician i then explained to her that this was a gynecological issue no response her overall tone was brash rude and short did i mention uncaring  unbelievable never ever have i been so appalled a woman calls and says she has breast pain and isnt sure if she should come in and this is how the front desk responds im outraged and waiting for someone to call me back from the office i think dr johnstone has the right to know how the front desk is treating her patients
