my husband and i decided to spend an overnight in downtown pittsburgh last minute we already had dinner reservations and show tickets we just had to find a hotel room the renaissance hotel is literally next door to the byham theatre where we had show tickets i walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer it was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor i came in just as the ceremony was finishing and when they were pronounced husband and wife those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple the hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed but still service incoming guests   check in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while i checked into the hotel i was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late i really liked the makeup mirror since i have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup  we had dinner and enjoyed our show we got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink we got there at pm and waited and waited at  a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table we asked to see a menu but was informed that the kitchen had closed at pm we finished the drinks we had ordered but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night the bartender was a gentleman as i had two bills stuck together when i paid him and he found us outside to return the other one we had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat  other than the snafu in the bar all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional the room was very clean and comfortable as the need comes up i will probably choose this hotel when i need to stay downtown again it is so close to pnc park across the clemente bridge and it is in the heart of the cultural district so all the theaters are very close by it is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far
