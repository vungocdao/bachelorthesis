i brought my dog in who was very sick and not doing well  they ran a few tests and charged me about a thousand dollars to tell me my dog was old and was going into kidney failure  i am a medical professional i asked if this could possibly be an infection and they said no the dog was just old and had about a month to live  i took the dog to my vet first thing monday morning and the first thing she said was the dog had a good chance of having a serious kidney infection and may respond to treatment  isnt that what i asked  after  days of antibiotic treatment the dog is brand new and back to normal  i cant say enough about my vet she is awesome and thorough  as for animal emergency clinic they are boobery and nothing more  a monkey can start and iv and give fluids i paid huge money for medical management of my dog  i do anesthesia for a living and if i performed this incompetently i would get my ass sued off for sure and i would deserve it  i guess vets have the luxury of never having to live under that ax and they also have the luxury of making a whole lot more money than i do evidently by what they charged  humans dont even get charged this much for simple iv therapy  totally ridiculous take your dog cat parrot whatever to the u of i they are expensive but your pet will be alive when you leave  this place is a joke to the highest magnitude
