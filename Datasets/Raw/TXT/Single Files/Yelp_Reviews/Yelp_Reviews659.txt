we have been going to caring hands with our dogs and cats for many years  dr curt saw us through the aging and passing of two cats and a dog all well into old age with great quality of life    dr curt also saw us through the adoption of a new dog who has a specialized problem an urge to eat every inedible object and substance he encounters  at  months old our new puppy developed a serious bowel obstruction and required removal of  feet of his intestines and reattachment  this was a complicated and risky surgery  because of curts supreme surgical skill that dog is with us today at  years old happy and loved  dr rebecca is also an outstanding vet both in terms of skill and caring feeling for animals and their human families  we have now seen dr rebecca many times for the regular care of the dog who lived and the newest addition to our family another rescue dog who came to us with a number of minor healthcare problems  we trust dr rebecca implicitly  the staff at caring hands are also amazing  good with people competent at the animal health care business loving to animals and able to calm and handle them  the staff has low turnover and some of them like gigi have been there as long as we have    you could not choose a better vet service in the champaignurbana and surrounding areas  if you are at some distance in an outlying small town as we are they are well worth the drive
