avoid this place like they serve salmonella  our dining experience at this restaurant was the worst i can remember  we sat for over  minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up  i ordered what the waiter claimed was their signature dish paella latorre  it was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm  i called over the waiter and explained   minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had reheated it  while the plate was hot the food was still tepid  i called the waiter over again and told him  he argued that he saw the chef reheat the food  by this time my business associate had almost completed his meal so i ate as much as i could and left about   we told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check  he returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do  we called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he would do  the following week i contacted blerim meta the general manager of this restaurant as well as aquavina  he has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience  avoid this restaurant  avoid aquavina
