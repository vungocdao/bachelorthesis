the reason for this update is the service  the hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average  all solid four stars  i was a bit disappointed initially with some of the prearrangements  in the past i was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl  friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check carving station etc  now with that being said the service was over the top  stars from start to finish  i get there and am running a bit late i ask the bellboy eric how long for a shoe shine he states its pretty much an overnight service  i tell him im in a rush  he runs downstairs and shines them himself done in  minutes  while im waiting my contact for the night ryan hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine  the party goes off without a hitch great staff good food some discounted wines and good premium open bar  after the hotel party we are walking outside and run into eric bellboy again ask for directions to other club instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club  one of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store  he ran down and bought them for her and brought them back  btw did i mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock  the next morning i get a ring around  am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior  everything about this place is three to four stars  my main pet peeves are the valet cost  and  overnight  there lack of flexibility in foodbev minimums but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service  you cant go wrong in pittsburgh for an event at this spot
