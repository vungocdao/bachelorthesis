this was a bad experience from the start the hostes told me that there was a one hour wait even though the dining room was half empty twenty minutes into my wait two parties came in and were seated while i waited after complining i was seated  ordered a salad and ribs the salad was good the ribs were as tough as leather the baked potato had to be broken with fork and knife since it probably had been baking for hours  the only good thing about the experience was the server which was very attentive and appologized profusely for the innedible food
