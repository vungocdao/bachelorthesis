i cant seem to understand why many people rate this as a firstclass sports bar because in actuality its one of the worst ive ever been in and i grew up going to the sports books in juarez mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the tv onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day  yes majerles is worse    okay well no one in thunder dans is gonna devour your soul but the place makes me feel like im sharing a pint with florentines catello di rosso gianfigliazzi and ciappo ubriachi in dantes inner ring of the seventh circle of hell  the set up is terrible  the tvs are difficult to see from everywhere in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to two screens  at one time they are both showing the same game  this is a problem during major events like the ncaa tournament or bowl games    moreover i would be kittenhearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game id rather watch    the bar is always crowded which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food  i wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at sports illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top  sports bars in the us
