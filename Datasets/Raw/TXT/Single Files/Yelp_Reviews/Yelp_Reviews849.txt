this place could be really great but unfortunately as of now it sucks  first of all ive never been to a concert venue like this with no bar  call me an alcoholic but i like my beer in hand when im nodding my head to some obscure hipster band ive never heard of  the outside is kind of cool but the inside is awful  the walls are stark white and look like those cheap walls people use to divide up apartments into more bedrooms  there were no decorations or paintings on the wall when i went even though i thought it was supposed to be some sort of gallery  maybe i went on a night that they were between showings  the space is small but if they hired a better interior designer they could have made it work  unforch it didnt  the sound system seemed cheap also  this place could be great if they just put in a bar and hired a decorator
