pages is a pittsburgh icon the ice cream is good the selection is vast and the price is right they have so many different things to try its nearly impossible to choose im a big fan of the cookie sundae brownie sundae and cinnamon roll sundae the options at this place are pretty much endless but sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go its better than dairy queen and you support a local business by going here what more could you ask for   i dont know if i would say that pages has particularly superior soft serve but its the experience and variety that makes this a four star place i do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like dairy queen but not by much what makes pages special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors its also the nostalgia that goes along with it its a business that hasnt changed much in its lifetime and thats what most people like about it you can count on pages to be there every marchoctober theyre going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime  it represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people it means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop   for those who have never been there there is no interior so youll have to eat in your car or standing outside i prefer to open the back of my suv sit there and enjoy the night while i eat my ice cream the parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes i typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason   beware they only accept cash but there is an atm on site
