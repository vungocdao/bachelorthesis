went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition   we were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal   our waitress was good but that couldnt save the food  the meal started out with some what i guess used to be foccacia  i say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless  we ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces   then we ordered the octopus which was fine but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish   the tuscan wings were ok but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them   finally the diver scallops  this dish was indeible  the scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty i was unable to eat it we sent it back and they did take off half of the price werent expecting anything just didnt want to eat it   after that we decided against dessert and left  i probably will not return
