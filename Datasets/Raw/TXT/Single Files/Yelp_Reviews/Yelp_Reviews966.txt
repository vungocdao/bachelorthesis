no no no no thats all i can say if you are planning on eating here    my daughter and i went in today on a sunday afternoon because we couldnt find another mexican restaurant that was open on sunday in central phoenix the service was fine but the food was awful the beans tasted like they came from a can rosarita brand and the salsa was just barely palatable for the same reason we each ate only half of our food before  leaving    when the waiter asked how the food was i told him and all he did was say he was sorry no offer to bring something else or comp one of our halfeaten meals   macayos on central used to have fresh food now it is just stale and tastes like it comes from a can you can definitely tell that they are cutting corners in the kitchen for the prices they charge you have a right to expect better food   i will never go there again
