i really really want to like showmars because its local but its just kind of icky in the environment it was probably a unique spot before they spread all over the area but now that charlotte is supersaturated its just not that interesting   the french fries are ok i guess the veggie pita is no goodclearly designed by someone who has never eaten food without meat on it maybe i was disappointed because i had high expectations and maybe its an alright place for the meateatersbut its just not good for me i havent had a good experience and ive been to a few locations i wont be going back
