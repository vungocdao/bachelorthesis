great local business servers are very attentive and run around like chickens with their heads cut off they are so busy usually this is a strange little spot but so good everything i have had from burgers to seafood was a yummy delight one of these mornings when im not working im going to go over there and have some breakfast  ive heard great things my only peeve about the restaurant is that they dont have a to go menu
