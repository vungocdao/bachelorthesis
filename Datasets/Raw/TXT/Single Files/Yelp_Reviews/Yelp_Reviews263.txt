i live about  minutes from belmont thus i do most of my shopping there as opposed to heading into the city itself and lets face it going down wilkinson toward uptown isnt exactly the best place to shop  i mix up my groceries between harris teeter walmart and bilo  this bilo in particular usually has a lot of helpful folks its very conveniently located and is open all the time  i prefer the deli here over walmart lets say and you can usually get a lot of items on sale that are cheaper than walmart as well  but not a lot of the stuff that isnt on sale  if you are looking for a grocery store in and around belmont this is probably the best place to go
