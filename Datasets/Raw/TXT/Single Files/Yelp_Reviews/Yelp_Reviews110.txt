i liked the bar   the food not at all first time here wife and i sat at the bar and people watched over some well poured drinks   strong point  then we screwed up and ordered food   i got their infamous lobster roll  glad i had a drink  overcooked and dry dry dry i thought lobster roll was generally made with a lobster saladlike mix  this lobster was dry and chewy  lots of it though  i guess that accounts for the high price   i went down to wholeys and got a much tastier one for  bucks  and wifes nachos were just a big pile of chips with some toppings thrown on the top  then the other day  we went back and i tried pizza  yuck  the toppings were terrible pepperoni sausage  how can youscrew that up but they did  two slices and boxed it up so as not to hurt the waitress feelings  but it went into the trashcan down the street  go for the hootch and not the food
