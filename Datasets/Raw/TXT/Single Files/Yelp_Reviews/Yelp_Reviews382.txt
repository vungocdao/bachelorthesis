bleah  i went here because i was staying at the westin across the street  we had about  people for dinner  the decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired  i started by ordering a couple bottles of wine and one came incorreclty which was pretty bad considering i ordered it by number  the waiter had all the personality of a rock  ok no biggie but then came the food  i ordered a  chicken breast that was supposed to come with hushpuppy breaded shrimp and some type of ravioli  the food came out at different times which left some of our food getting cold  when my chicken showed up it appeared to be boiled and had some really bad sauce on it that i cant explain  it was pretty unedible after a couple of bites  also the shrimp came  butterflied and sauteed definatly not as described on the menu   all in all i would skip this place the food is bad one star for the decour and wine list  but they even managed to screw up the wine order
