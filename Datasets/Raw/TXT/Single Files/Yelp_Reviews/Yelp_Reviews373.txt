staff was very friendly but food and drinks were disappointing this place markets itself as martini specialists but i had to ask for my martini to be remade a second time as it came without olives also  olives were standard jarred fair a much better martini can be had at urban sip above the ritz  they have spanish giant olives handstuffed with blue cheese
