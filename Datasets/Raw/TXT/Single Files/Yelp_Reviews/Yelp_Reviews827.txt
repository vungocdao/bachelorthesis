decided to take a short trip downtown to try the central coast wine tasting event held here last week  we had a blast  while the rep that hosted the wine tasting made the wine tasting a fun and informative event we really enjoyed the atmosphere and food   the tapas plate that came with the wine tasting was fabulous blue cheese and bacon stuffed dates a super tasty california cheese bought some to take home and a tiny but very yummy shrimp salad that only made us want to try more    jeannie loves scallops so naturally she ordered the scallop martini  i know deep down she did not want to share but she graciously fed me one of those monsters  she said they are the best she has ever had and i have a hard time arguing with her  three big tender perfectly cooked and seasoned scallops resting in a martini glass  the accompanying sauce was absolutely delicious  we also ordered a single cheese plate with a cheese from spain mahon i think  loved that one too so of course we bought some to enjoy later   wont wait for a wine tasting to make our return
