the food can be good here not great but good but the biggest problem for me is the awful service  somebody teach these people some customer service  i swear that the guy who waited on me the last time i was there was high  the interminable waiting for refills on drinks and the check drove my blood pressure through the roof  ive determined that the secret to getting good service from anyone here is to be a hot looking college girl  that seemed to keep the waiters attention focused on the table next to mine  maybe she was one of the more positive posters here
