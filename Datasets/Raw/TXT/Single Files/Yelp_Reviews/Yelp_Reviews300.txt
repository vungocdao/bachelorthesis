ive been here quite few times and while fh isnt perfect its better than so e of the reviews here make it sound first the bad like other reviews have mentioned sometimes the service can be bit slow its usually fine but it admittedly has a few more bad days than some other places on the other hand they have pretty solid lunch specials great wings the hot bbq are delicious and some nice beer specials  drafts on thursday  domestics yes please they also have plenty of tvs and a pretty good customer rewards program and when it comes to a sports bar what more do you really need
