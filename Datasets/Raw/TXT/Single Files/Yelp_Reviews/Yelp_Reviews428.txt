one of my least favorite airports  the flights i end up taking into charlotte eg stl to phf invariably seem to have me jumping across a few terminals to make my connection  youd think the situation would be improved by the huge number of moving walkways connecting the different gates but there is nothing more infuriating than being stuck behind a family of four blocking the entire walkway or someone slowly trudging along on the left  for gods sake people just like on the road pass on the left walk on the right  there are people in this airport obviously not you that are in a hurry  cant speak much to the food and drink options here  the selections seem plentiful  us airways was friendly to me here too when a flight was canceled back home  they shuttled me to a nearby hotel  i forget where  and covered both my transportation and lodging for the night  good work guys
