since my return to pittsburgh i have been to the new elbow room several times the food has always been decent and the location on walnut is convenient when im in the neighborhood shopping    today i went for a late lunch  honestly there were  people in the restaurant  it took forever for food to arrive at our table  could it be attributed to the fact that i was eating somewhere between lunch and dinner and they arent sufficiently staffed  i dont know  my beloved was happy as always with his enormous fish sandwich  my reuben sandwich was just okay  the corned beef was pretty chewy  probably should have gotten a salad    im hoping that i just caught them on a bad afternoon
