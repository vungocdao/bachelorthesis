had the opportunity to visit smokey bones this week i had the rib  chicken white meat they were out of dark meat combo it was actually pretty good however the worst part of this dining experience was the host who was suppose to great us when we came through the door he started off by saying just  as though  people was not enough well i can appreciate some good hospitality and a welcoming personality before patronizing a restaurant that i dont frequent very often
