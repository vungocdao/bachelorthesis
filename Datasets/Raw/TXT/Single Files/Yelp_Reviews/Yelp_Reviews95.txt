when theres this much hype about a place its hard to live up to but they did a pretty damn good job maybe not the best sandwich ive ever had in my life but if it was any random sandwich shop id happened to stumble into it would definitely be five stars without a second thought  the chili cheese fries were among the best ive ever had i dont know what they do to them  its not the chili thats particularly great its not the cheese thats particularly great and its not the fries that are particularly great but somehow putting them all together just turns it into unbeatable awesome  the sandwich itself i got the corned beef was very good despite the fact that i hate coleslaw but they dont mean the typical mayoandcarrotandpurpleonion colesla
