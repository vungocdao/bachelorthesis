a great little place to see shows very small very intimate a great setting for seeing a band if a band you want to see is playing here be sure to go it doesnt get anymore up close and personal than this there is no seating or alcohol so if you dont mind standing and being sober it is well worth it the art here is some of first fridays best as far as i am concerned leagues above all the other galleries be sure to stop and see the art here if you are out then
