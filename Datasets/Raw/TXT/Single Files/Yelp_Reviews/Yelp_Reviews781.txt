dined with a good friend of mine while in town so the slowish service was no bother actually we had good service they were on top of my need for water with lots of ice  lisa had the chile rellanos and she said they were good the portion was large and she took about half home  i got the chimichanga it was a delight the meat was done perfectly and was very flavorful and not at all bland usually my rice goes uneaten but this rice was about the best mexican rice ive ever had the beans were as i like the
