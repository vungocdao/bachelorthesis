i have ordered red devils pizza and wings for takeout for years now but today was the first time i dined in the restaurant  we started with the potato skins which were served slightly overcooked and without any sour cream which red devil does not carry  really who serves potato skins without sour cream  for our entrees i ordered the baked lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the double bacon cheeseburger  i only took about two bites of my lasagna which was so overloaded with flavorless marinara that i could not bare another and my boyfriend only ate about half of his double cheeseburger that looked comparable to a mcdonalds burger and tasted like a slightly better quality school lunch burger  these three items and one pepsi cost us  dollars before tip  all in all we left hungry and forty dollars poorer    we will not be back for anything but the occasional pizza and wings
