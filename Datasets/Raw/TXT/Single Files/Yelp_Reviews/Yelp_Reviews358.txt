i dont much like the look of this place  i never would have ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews  but they serve some pretty good pizza    i have eaten trillions of pizzas  maybe more i lost count  and im not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza  i grew up in chicago where i was weaned on deep dish pan and thin crust pizzas  i lived in nyc for years and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet  for the record my favorites are difaras in brooklyn and coalfire a relatively young pizza joint in chicago  brixx does a fine job of the thin crust  we had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks  both were pretty tasty    ill go back for more whenever the opportunity arises  but heres what they could do a little better  get that oven hotter and change the flour blend so that theres a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust  theres an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like if that shit dont crack that shit is whack  so when the pizza is folded the bottom of the crust should crack  ditto for the edge of the crust  allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust like spinach ricotta etc  brixxs pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere  it was cooked only to the point of being breadlike  still tasty enough but not quite there  i hate to sound snotty about this but i think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning  that crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible  also the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula but when that was added the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didnt melt at all and the arugula didnt wilt  the result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza  pizza aside they offer local beers at least one nc wine and have ecofriendly waterless urinals in the mens room i applaud the effort though that probably wont be the highlight of the review  next time i go in ill see it they can crispify my pie
