ok this place was soo fantastic i ordered the appetizer sicilian garlic cheese bread it had the perfect amount of cheese and garlic the bread wasnt hard either just right for my main entree i went with chicken broccoli fettuccine alfredo i definitely made the right choice it tasted delicious to top it off they include dessert with dinner
