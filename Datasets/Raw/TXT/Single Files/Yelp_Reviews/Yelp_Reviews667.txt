ive  reviewed another cracker barrel in the past and this location lives up to the allamerican constant that ive come to expect from cracker barrels its a tradition for my sister and i to have a meal at cracker barrel when i come to visit her so we headed straight over there when i got off the train yesterday morning i was pleasantly surprised to be seated without a wait it was about  in the morning and the parking lot was packed postchurch crowd  but we must have come in at the perfect time because there was one empty clean table and it was ours our server was very nice our food came out quickly and tasted great you know how sometimes when food comes out really fast it tastes old like they made it earlier and waited for someone to order it this wasnt the case it was all piping hot and fresh the odds were ever in our favor
