this hotel is in need of a renovation this becomes most apparent when you look at the bathrooms which have fixtures and mildew growth both from the seventies ive stayed in motels that were cleaner and better appointed  i could have done without the sleep number bed but thats probably more of a personal preference than anything however it appeared to me that the money would have been better spent on updating the rooms themselves apparently it used to be a marriott some time ago  im guessing they decided to drop the brand rather than update to marriotts standards  the continental breakfast was a crime  for buffet style eggs from a bag no less sausage french toast and oily potato cubes they were trying to say were home fries is unconscionable passing on this gastronomic atrocity i decided to invest my money in an english muffin and two  oz yogurts only option is strawberry banana really  at least there was a pretty nice pool where we could oh closed for private party just as well  thankfully this was a business trip and the client is paying expenses otherwise i might have actually felt upset
