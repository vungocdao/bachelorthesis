free wing fridays oh yeah  i dont even like wings usually but silkys knows how to cook em so they dont taste fatty  get a side of atomic sauce which is flavorful as well as hot  id buy it by the bottle if i could  the menu is huge and everything ive had has been good  i always get the home fries on the side which are cooked with onions and fried jalapenos   great waitresses too  would be five stars if it had decent air conditioningin the summer sitting inside is painful
