stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about  pm  the place was empty  the bartender chris was rude and very vulger  he made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down  we decided to stay for a drink anyway  after going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock  on new years eve  the bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next  minutes  we paid for our drinks and got up and left  might be the strangest employee experience i had in awhile
