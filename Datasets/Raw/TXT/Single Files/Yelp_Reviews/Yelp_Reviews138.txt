my mom called me so giddy on the phone today i thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery  no  her sofa from gene sane arrived  it made her just as happy    she and i went to gene sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair  the fabric was not inexpensive  some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric some of it is not so special and i am convinced could be found elsewhere for less  however they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process  and my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there  my parents live in oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator  gene sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents building  they brought the sofa midupholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator  that is such great customer service it is ridiculous  it did fit which is great but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment  this is the kind of stuff that high end places in nyc know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case it was good to know they have the skills to do so  they were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back  these are the kinds of things that make a big difference
