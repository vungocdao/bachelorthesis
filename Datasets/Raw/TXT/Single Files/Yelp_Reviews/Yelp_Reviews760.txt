first time at majerles with three others we went before the rattlers playoff game but after a dbacks game so it was really hopping in there got seated right away though   we were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant it lengthened our service time considerably  our daughter ordered the salad special it had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing her husband got the rojo diablo sandwich he said it was stringy and didnt finish it my wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a lettuce bun she got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce i got the allstar burger it was good but overcooked by two levels   the fries and sweet potato fries were good as was the selection of drinks all told for three sandwiches a salad and six beers it totaled  too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location   thunder dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews i may not be back
