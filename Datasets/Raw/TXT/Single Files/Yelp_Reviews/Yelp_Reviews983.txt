i really hate to give this place a less than stellar review because i want to like it so badly the location is great far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like youre in a more urban area big family style benches allow for friendmaking outside and individual tables inside im surprised i came back after the first time on a busier night we couldnt get service to save our lives we made sure we werent stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat staring at servers running around us for  minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead we sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so i could merely ask where the bathroom was atbut nothing i even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after  more minutes we gave up apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word that being the last straw our feelings a little hurt and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service we left half full beers and walked out upset i still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong  now we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent for mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that i usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for i dont see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that i like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friendscoworkers we still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but i cant seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth bummersville
