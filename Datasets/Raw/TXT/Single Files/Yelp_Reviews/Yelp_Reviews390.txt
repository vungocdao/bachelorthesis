this is the place to be in charlotte i am a nighttime gymgoer and i needed a gym with late night hours the dowd is open until  during the week which while i would prefer  works for me also going at nonpeak hours saves me from the parking and crowding issues that others seem to face aint no crowds at  pm i generally stay in the womens fitness center which is a gym inside itself but every now and then ill make it upstairs the desk staff is always friendly and there are plenty of amenities to utilize the one area i havent ventured into yet are the group exercise mainly for scheduling reasons but i am eager to sneak into one one day
