although the staff was friendly and the language was not a barrier for me as it was for others the food i got was not very good after i ordered the general tsos chicken the woman turned on the fryer and without waiting for the oil to heat up she put in the chicken and my crab rangoon therefore when i ate the food it wasnt crispy as a good general tsoscrab rangoon  should be another thing that i noticed was that the chicken that she put in the fryer was sitting on the counter in the heat note she hadnt fried any in quite some time which is why she had to turn the fryer on the person that said the food was too sweet was right even though the menu said spicy for my meal there was no zip at all take it for what its worth but i know i will be looking for another restaurant to get my take out from now on
