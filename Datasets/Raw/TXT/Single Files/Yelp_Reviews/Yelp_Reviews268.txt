had a rare only person in the house night so i decided to treat myself     i have passed by the panda for years and have always wanted to stop by but my wife is very picky about chinese food   with only me i had the perfect opportunity  i stopped in on the way home on tuesday july rd to order and go   entered and found really nothing to write home about the interior decor  but i am of the mindset that if the decor is not great the food usually is  long experiences with mexican restaurants in the west  there were several people in the front area either waiting for their food or waiting to order  but nobody sitting down  it was early in the evening though  i love general tsos chicken and most of the time it is not that spicy to appeal to a wider audience   i ordered the dinner special which came with fried rice and an egg roll   i could see thru to the kitchen behind the counter and was able to watch as my food was prepared  it came quickly and i took it home  as i was leaving there were more people coming in  i got home and grabbed a beer and got into my order  and the general tsos was spicy  the way it should be  it was a generous portion and the fried rice was flavorful  the egg roll well it was an egg roll but i love egg rolls as well  be mindful this was just a review of one dish  i do have to go back and try more
