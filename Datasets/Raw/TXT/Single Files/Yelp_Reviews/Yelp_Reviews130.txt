cheap doesnt necessarily mean bad  at least not here at the stans market however you will definitely have to check double check and triple check on some occasions before you buy anything  we stop here twice a month to do our groceries  mostly for less likely perishable produce like the garlic ginger peppers baby cucumbers however we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis if you happen to buy some of the soft fruits like the strawberries blue berries or the grapes  you will most likely need to finish it up with in a day or two if not you can always freeze them to make smoothies  let me say this again this place is cheap the prices i pay for the produce here are usually  of the price i pay at giant eagle so if you know your produce  this is definitely the place to stop
