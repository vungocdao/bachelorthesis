note  i only just got my car back so i cannot yet comment on the longterm resilience of the paint job  my wife bought a new vw passat in december and was hit by a dump truck in january there was body damage to the driverside front door back door and rear quarter panel our insurance is with geico who has an agent that works right out of abras office so i took it there for an assessment  everyone was extremely kind and helpful the process of getting the estimate both by geico and by abra was very quick and easy also abra was nice enough to provide me with a rental car on their dime enterprise came out to abras location and we took care of the rental there  all i paid for was the insurance which was like day  abra sent daily updates via text message letting me know their progress and as soon as they had an estimated completion time the let me know that as well  i dropped it off on tuesday january  and they completed all the repairs and paint on friday however i couldnt pick it up until monday january  as the paint needed to dry  the car looks excellent
