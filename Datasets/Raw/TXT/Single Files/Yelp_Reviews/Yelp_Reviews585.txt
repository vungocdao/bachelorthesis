classic just like you remember  perhaps like me you remember trips to the aw as a kid on a hot summer day to get that enormous frosty mug of sweet cold root beer as a special treat  i remember agonzing over the decision ice cream cone or frosty mug of beer parents wouldnt let us have both   i hadnt stopped into an aw in a long long time and was looking for something a little less fastfoody on my drive south when i decided to stop at this aw  ive driven by it on the interstate a hundred times on my way back and forth from minneapolis to madison but had never before stopped in  i got a burger and fries which were fine but the real treat was a real frosty mug eat in only that i could fill myself at the beverage counter with straight from the barrel aw root beer  now that was a really something special
