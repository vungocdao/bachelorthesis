another chain sit down by the mall  but not at the top of my list the food hasnt seemed to change since ive gone here except for less options  waiting for a table is common unless you go at really off peak times recently got a burger there asked for well done  and burger arrived bloody and red  waiter took it back and about  minutes brought the same burger back and was still pink on the inside  was offered something else  but the others i was with were already done  did get a coupon for a return visit good deal with the  for  and an app if your food is cooked right
