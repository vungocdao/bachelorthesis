staying as airline crew at the sheraton hotel across the street i asked the front desk person to recommend me a good mexican restaurant  he recommended the canyon cafue which is in the same exact mallmovie complex as this place mi amigos    i reviewed the canyon cafues menu and didnt care for it since its more of a fusion restaurant not real mexican food  i told the hostess that i wanted more authentic food and she told me to try mi amigos  i walked  feet to this place  i have to say the server was a sweetheartvery friendly welcoming  thats the only thing i liked about this place aside from the cadillac margarita for   i ordered the tortilla soup  okis
