this was absolutely terrible  it was so highly reviewed but absolutely terrible  not that we ate the food because we never had a chance  we were seated immediately in an area with another table that was served by our server  there were only two tables taken in the restaurant and our server took  minutes to bring us drinks  still waiting on our drinks our appetizer came out with no silverware no plates still no drinks  our server came by we had already asked him about the drinks once  shortly thereafter he brought the drinks still no plates and no silverware  we waited a few more minutes and he brought out our salads  still no plates and no silverware  when we asked again about the plates he laughed as though we had made some strange request  we continued to wait  no chopsticks no silverware no plates  after it became too ridiculous to handle we got up and walked out  its the only place that weve ever done that before  and we have had some terrible service  the food that we stared at looked terrible  in hindsight im glad that we had no utensils  if you have an hour to kill are looking for terrible service arent in a rush and want to order some food that looks disgusting you may want to check it ou
