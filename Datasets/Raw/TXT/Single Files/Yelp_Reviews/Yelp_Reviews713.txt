we ate tonight at nitaya and our food was excellent  i had the pineapple chicken curry and my wife had a modified number   we had potstickers for an appetizer and sticky rice and mango for dessert  the only slight complaint was that the decor was slightly dated but for authentic thai this was it  the service was great and no problems with english understanding him or us
