my friend and i stopped here for a light dinner before going to a movie at the amc theater in the same plaza not sure why we picked this place i think we just both realized we were kinda hungry after wed already parked and walked in   mi amigos was never really on my radar as a place to try im more a fan of the holeinthewall real mexican food place this place kinda felt like a mexicanthemed or mexicaninspired restaurant but it lacked something almost felt like a food court with table service   the food was fine it wasnt bad the service was fine   my friend had the shrimp and garlic platter and enjoyed it i had a small tortilla soup we probably overdid it with the chips and salsa and even those were just fine i would have liked for someone to just leave a pitcher of water no ice on the table because it felt like an eternity between refills and each refill succeeded in mostly adding more ice to my glass no bueno  no dessert no drinks wasnt really feelin it  i wouldnt say im jumping at the chance to eat here again its serviceable if i find myself at the az center and other people want to eat here i will do my best to make suggestions to go elsewhere but i wont encourage it but i wont fight it if the majority rules
