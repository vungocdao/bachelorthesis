gross  i can not believe my experience with this hotel i started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in i was at the westin  weeks prior which was amazing and a very great experience so i thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more people are coming i want to get an even better place so the omni i thought would be great and its right next to epicenter were made reservations at flemings  we took pictures of how disgusting the room looked there was a cockroach wing not in a corner but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor the chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained i stayed at the westin just  weeks before and the omni couldnt even hold a candle to that place i have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel it is the worst room i have ever stayed in ever  there is nothing modern about the hotel there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date the last time i saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach i dont care how close this is to epicenter its not worth the price we had friends from out of town that just couldnt believe how gross the room was we only stayed one night thank god  the front desk people were snarky and made you feel as if you were being judged you have to walk by them any time you leave your room the whole experience was awful and uncomfortable i am going to post the pics
