recently i visited a handful of international food stores in champaign il far east market was the most impressive among them their produce selection was incredible a short list includes mangos banannas korean pears luffa eggplant casava clabaza squash lotus root galanga plantain daikon dirion and many more there was a variety of mushrooms they offer very fresh seafood other items that were offered bananna blossom in brine canned jack fruit pickled caggage bamboo shoots quail eggs fried gluten dried lotus seeds and a variety of exotic teas if you are looking for a more authentic selection of fresh foods this is likely your best bet the grocery store is rustic and it almost feels as though you step into an inner city market in another country when you visit far east market they take both checks and cash but do not accept credit
