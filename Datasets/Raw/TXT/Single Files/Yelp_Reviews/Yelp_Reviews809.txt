hard rock cafe is a cool place to go if youre in the area and want to kill time before a concert or a game but destination bar its not the food is average and the drinks arent anything out of the ordinary infact theres nothing really unique about the hard rock aside from the fact that they jacked up the prices because youre dining andor drinking at the hard rock cafe   im disappointed that it doesnt compare to others around the world and seems out of place in phoenix a hard rock scottsdale would be way cooler
