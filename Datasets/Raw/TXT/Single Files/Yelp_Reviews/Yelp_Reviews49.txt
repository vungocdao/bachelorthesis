the first time i went here was with a group  we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party   i had a horrible experience  vowed never to go back  at that time i even had a terrible interaction with the owner  this time i was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it decided to try again since it was more about the get together than the foodlocation  this time overpriced food and bad service  overall it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price   i had the veal speciality   large portion but ok  staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present  i am a pittsburgh native  this is a bad neighborhood   i am not interested in ever going back
