this is the worst chinese restaurant that i have ever eaten at  i went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed  i dont write many reviews but i didnt want someone to get suckered in like i did    the one good thing that i will say about this restaurant was that the food was very cheap  however i could not stomach but a few bites so i still did not get my moneys worth
