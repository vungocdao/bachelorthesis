better than most chain pizza its ok    we got a thin crust which was nice and crispy only a little greasy ok ingredients not amazing on the cheese and had kind of a bland crust  i guess that doesnt sound too good but i really promise its better than any national chain pizza youll find in town  it also has a really friendly laidback atmosphere
