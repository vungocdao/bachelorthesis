i used to love db when it first opened in the waterfront but it has gone down hill over the years the games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality it takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil the atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people now it is run down and many of the games are app related games fruit ninja and d experience rides with such games you cant even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens last time i went back in the winter many of the games were broken which made for a negative player experience i would go to db to play some games again in the future but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets
