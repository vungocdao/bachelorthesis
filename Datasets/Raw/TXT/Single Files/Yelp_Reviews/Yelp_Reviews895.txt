it had been years since i had been back to ritos i was craving it for lunch and thought lets do an old school affordable lunch  i typically eat burritos at the lunch trucks so i thought ritos being in the middle of the hood nothing fancy outdoor seating and so on should be a quick affordable quick lunch for two of us  we got our two burritos after waiting almost  minutes in their lobby  the  we spent in line i know i knowwhat did i expect going there between ampmbut seriously they have all the ingredients made its just an assembly line chipotle style dang it so anyway the food took way too long and  later for one green chile regular burrito and one red enchilada style burrito with rice and beans in the hood had me complaining about my planned cheap lunch before i took my first bite   im not gonna lie the burritos are tasty and a good size other comments mentioned salty and greasy and yes that is true on both but thats why the place is famous for its simple saltygreasy food  i have had better for the same or less  and for a much better atmospherethat place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheapvintage seating a sign a mural somethinggive the place a little character and i can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned  there  anyway not my most favorable review but i think ritos has taken their fame to their head and caters to the foodiesdowntown administrative crowd vs the working class and neighborhood area peeps
