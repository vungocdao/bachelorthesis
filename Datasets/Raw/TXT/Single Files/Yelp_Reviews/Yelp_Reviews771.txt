awful  gross  disappointing  a coworker and i werent in the mood for subway mcdonalds or einsteins so we decided to try chicos tacos  a place id driven by many times but hadnt tried before  the items on the menu looked decent enough and i settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go  i got back to work and settled in to try my meal  the tacos were actually not in preformed taco shells but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried  sadly there was hardly any meat in either and most of each taco was the shell  they had good flavor but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam plate below sort of ruined them  the beans and ride were both inedible  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor with a layer or congealed cheese over the top  the rice was mushy and bland except for the topmost layer which was overseasoned with cumin  i was given a small bag of tortilla chips and those were passable  including a large fountain drink i paid   i wont be back especially when theres a filibertos just down the road
