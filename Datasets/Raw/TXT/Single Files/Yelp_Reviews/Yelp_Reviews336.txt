i have been to the actors theatre for several productions now and i always forget to review them  from chaps to the evil dead to rocky horror some are packed some are well less than packed but they never disappoint  if you should happen by on opening night they typically have an extra special event where you get some tasty goodies from the sponsor seems like it is usually the same one but it may change from show to show as well  they also have a cult movie night on all many some mondays with free admission and popcorn so be sure and check that out if you are looking for something to do  like most places they have a nice little bar and drink prices are not too bad but it would be nice if they would give you the whole beer instead of pouring  of it or so into a cup  i do not know if they keep the extra little bit for themselves or the next guy in line but it is just one of those things that can be a little annoying you know
