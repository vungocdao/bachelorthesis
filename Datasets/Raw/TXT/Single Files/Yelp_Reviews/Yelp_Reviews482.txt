everything was sold out when i needed to be in charlotte and so i tried this location mainly because it was available for my dates i was worried that it wouldnt be nice but i was pleasantly surprised   the room was clean well decorated and had a bedroom and separate living room with its own tv it also had a small well equipped  kitchen i didnt use it but it had pots pans  burners a full size refrigerator and sinks etc   they didnt have a yucky comforter but a nice duvet too and plenty of pillows which i insist on   they had a good desk with free internet and the comminity areas were nice inside they had breakfast which i was always too late for  ends at am but looked nice and they also have a bar that stays open late in that same spot  outside is a common area with a fire pit and lots of seating  they have a little store with most essentials in the lobby  hours too i had a terrible dr pepper craving at like midnight and was able to get one downstairs thank goodness i also grabbed coffee in the morning only to have my boss tell me we were going to starbucks and i accidentally said right in front of the desk clerk    oh then i wont drink this crappy coffee    i felt so bad as soon as i said it i am sure it is not crappy   i would stay here again it was comfortable and affordable the parking is kinda weird but over all i was very impressed
