there has to be better italian food in pittsburgh  i dont know why anyone would come here  i had an overnight field trip with my students to pittsburgh  the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show  they had us sectioned off which was great for privacy  also since the students were loud  their service is a hot mess  they only had  waiters serving our  person group  it was not organized at all  just getting our drinks out was confusing  the waiters just came out with any drink  then asked  anyone order this  this is why my table sat drinkless breadless  saladless for the longest time  for our dinner we were given a salad entree  tiramisu  the salad was definitely straight out of the bag  doused with some cheap dressing  it didnt taste fresh at all  there was a list of  or so entrees we could choose from  they came out quite haphazardly  i unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo  worst ever  i could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar  i tried to douse it with pepper  cheese but alas it did nothing to help it  some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked  the tiramisu also was gross  it definitely was made  cut awhile ago  just kept cold in their fridge  the redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor  old fashioned coin operated games and the mystery show  ive never been to one  was really excited  they started after we ate our entrees  intermissioned during dessert  the actors were super funny  interactive  my students loved them which of course makes me happy  seriously though their food is so bad
