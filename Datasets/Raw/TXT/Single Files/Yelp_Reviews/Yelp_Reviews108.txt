last weekend my mother and i headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods  lunch meat and cheese from penn mac  veggies at stans  needed some new spices from penzeys for a chili i was going to make that daywe were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping  we parked in front of rolands and see the sign famous for lobster rolls and bloody marys  perfect   my mother got the lobster roll which she said was good the bread from mancinis was of course tasty  toasted and buttery  delicious mostly because it was mancinis bread i had the lobster roll minus the carbs on a salad  and the lobster was tasty no doubt  i mean lobster is just  good for the price though not sure that i got enough bang for my buck the salad was something i could have picked up at getgo in the premade section i just didnt feel satisfied at the end of my meal i couldnt even drink my bloody mary this is a rare affair way too much horseradish and i often like horseradish in my bloodies  and it was cold  didnt even take my winter coat off so needless to say not the best experience  talk about false advertisement
