staying in this hotel changed my entire view on the city of pittsburgh  the hotel is in an extremely vibrant area and i am not embarrassed to admit that pittsburgh is pretty damn cool  the rooms in this hotel are clean and the staff is fantastic  if youre driving parking is conveniently located across the street though the parking garage should come with a set of directions on exactly where to pay when you leave the building or maybe im just more obtuse than the average parker    the hotel restaurant has pretty good food and the bar is a great place to hang out and have some snacks the housemade chips are addictive and enjoy a nice drink  and if you have the great pleasure of having sam as your bartender youre definitely guaranteed good conversation and a few laughs  just make sure you bring up justin biebershe really loves that little fella
