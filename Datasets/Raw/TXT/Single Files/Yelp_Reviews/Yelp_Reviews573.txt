i have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store  today i tried going back after a year and again the staff is so unhelpful unknowledgeable and downright rude  i called to talk with the manager and her attitude is just as bad  which i guess explains the attitudes of the staff  there are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers
