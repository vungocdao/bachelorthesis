this place is really great for teriyaki  in fact it is really the only place worth going for teriyaki  first of all  it is really very inexpensive lunch for two under   easily second of all  the service is great because it is family run  you see the same people there everytime  the food is really good  and just hits the spot when you have a hankering for teriyaki  my only complaint would be the hours bums me out when i want teriyaki for dinner and they are already closed
