we had to be near downtown today and when scrolling through nearby restaurants on my phone i saw this one  on google its rated  stars  here its  stars  and only a single dollar sign  so we drove over  the place looks like something you might find in mexico  no hostess  walk up to the counter order your food wait for your number to be called walk into the dining area ducking under a low arch if you over  tall where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs  seriouslyif you didnt know you were in phoenix youd swear you were in an eatery in mexico  they also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter  on to the actual food  as this was my first time here i ordered the chimi  i usually do that so i have a basis for comparison to other places  my wife had the albondigas soup  we both liked our dishes  the chimi was done perfectly  a light crunch of the shell  not overcooked not greasy  the chicken was moist and tender  and it was a pretty big chimi  i think one does need to add some pico to it because the chickens seasoning was very mild  the pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference  and the mexican rice was very nice  i wish it wasnt so far from home gilbert because id love to make this my regular spot for mexican food  i would say it blows away just about every place else ive found in the valley and is neckandneck with guerreros in tempe  i cant choose between the two at this moment  i hope to return here and will be trying something different  their menu is pretty extensive with several traditional dishes including menudo lengua and albondigas
