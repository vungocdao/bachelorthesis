went to thai house on a thursday around pm  a few others were in the restaurant but not crowded at all  like other reviewers i liked the dress of the servers and the decor of the place was pretty cool  i sat in a booth by myself and was immediately greeted by the server with a menu  i ordered a green tea sakesooo good  it came in a little glass bottle and it called sakeme  i plan to buy it  as i enjoyed my sake i ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings  totally not what i expectedtwo rolllike dough things came out and it tasted like it lookedjust like raw dough stuffed with lots of crunchy lettucelike pieces and tiny chopped meat  i didnt see any shrimp not even mini shrimp  i was thinking they brought me the wrong item but when i didnt eat my dough the waiter said you dont like your shrimp dumpling i didnt have the heart or the energy after a long day of travel to say anything except i want to have room for my pad thai  so i awaited my chicken pad thai hoping it was what i am used to  the pad thai wasnt badnot great but not bad  once in a while i got the taste of mayonaisse but i was starving at this point and it did the trick  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasnt worth the risk of pad thai all over my rental car  im not sure if ill go back to thai house  i will certainly look for an alternative next time im in town  if im starved and cant find any other place ill probably give thai house another shotill just stay away from anything that says dumpling
