i went here for their new customer cleaning discount i made the appointment last week i showed up  minutes before my  oclock appointment as requested the front doors were locked no one visible in the office no response to knocking no closed sign or back at clock after pounding on the door in the rain for several minutes before calling the offices phone a person who claimed to work for a sister practice answered confirmed my appointment and put me on hold while he tried to get ahold of someone in the office after several minutes in the rain he told me that he could only reach an answering machine i left  i have never been so grossly disrespected by whats purported to be a business i have never seen such colossal unprofessionalism this business and medical practice does not give a fig about its patientscustomers time judging by the other reviews here i clearly dodged a bullet
