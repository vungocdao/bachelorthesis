it takes me  minutes to drive there and it is well worth it the food is phenomenal and considering its quality the price is just right the staff is also fantastic   i am particularly fond of tom who s very energetic and engaging  pane bianco is an absolute gem and the kind of place i dont mind driving  min to get there the fact that they are right next to lux is also a plus  however i cant say the same about dinner where i had the lasagnafor   it was an abomination all there was in there was some tomato sauce bechamel and meat sauceno cheese or meat saucealtogether a huge disappointment never having dinner there again
