the worst apartment ive ever lived in ive only been here  months and im miserable if you are thinking of renting here dont the apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us  times in  months they have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent if you are considering living here i highly encourage you to look elsewhere
