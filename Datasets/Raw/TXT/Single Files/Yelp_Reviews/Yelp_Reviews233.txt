i dont know how this place has stayed in business for so long  it has never appealed to me yet some family member drags me there every five years or so  it never changes it seems like an independently owned chilis  the menu is boring  the food nothing special    most recently i ordered a salad and asked for some rolls or bread and they didnt have anything except for some super spongy italian sliced bread that tasted like a step up from wonder bread  my beet salad had such crunch beets they were barely cooked  grapefruit segments were all membrane  lettuce was ice cold nearly frozen    see you in another five years
