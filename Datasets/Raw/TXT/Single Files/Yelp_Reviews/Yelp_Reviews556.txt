ill cut right to the tender juicy heart of longhornits a great chain steakhouse and as far as i am concerned it puts outback to shame  their steak and service are just flatout better in my mind than outback  i am not an outback hater or anything its just than when i tell people about longhorn the response i usually get is why dont you just go to outback  well heres what keeps me coming back to longhorn instead  steaks are always juicy tender and cooked to perfection  ive never had a bad or less than satisfactory steak at longhorn  i usually order the oz flos filet  dont worry oz of quality steak is more than what you think and is more than enough for most people see pics    i love the crab and lobster dip see pics  i order this almost every time i go here  i dont know if the crab and lobster are imitation or not and to be honest i really dont care  all i know is that it is a stellar appetizer and puts the overrated blooming onion to shame as far as appetizers go  i love the mashpotatoes  i just wish they would cut back on the butter a little bit  i mean we all love butter but no ones trying to sacrifice their life for it  i recommend asking for lite butter on the mashpotatoes if you choose to order them as a side to go with your entree  i love the brown bread that they serve before the meal  its good but its better when its warm and fresh and ive had some nonfresh bread before  i cant say that the bread is consistently better than outbacks  the service is always topnotch  everyone from the hostess to the manger to the servers are extremely friendly and polite  drinks are always promptly refilled and orders are always correct    they do serve a few select beers on draft such as bud light and blue moon but beware they arent cheap and can turn a reasonably priced dinner into an expensive one very quickly  in recent visits i have tried to stay away from the alcoholic beverages while there    theres nothing not to like about longhorn  reasonable prices great food and awesome servicewhat else do you need
