everything about this place screams a budget hotel except for the price   this is a motel quality establishment charging upscale hotel quality prices    granted the staff is nice  and if you need a place that allows pets i guess this could be a good choice   otherwise dont be fooled   i have staid at other homewood suites in the past and this one is certainly not up to par
