i live on the east side of madison and i always eat at the imperial gardens near e washington and this imperial was a let down the restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff wasnt as amazing as i hoped for   for starters the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down my friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a weird sort of sour after taste i had the pepper steak and i did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also had a strange after taste  the staff was very kind but a little annoying its was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us we could then see her staring at us from across the room waiting to start another unwanted conversation  imperial garden middleton will definitely be memorable but for all the wrong reasons
