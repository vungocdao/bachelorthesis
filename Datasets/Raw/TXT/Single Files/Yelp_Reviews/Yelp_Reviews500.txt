what a lousy experience  perhaps there was a reason they were so unprepared but as a regular hertz gold customer i was astonished at the disorganization of this facility last thursday afternoon a bus full of travelers many gold got off the bus to find their name not on the gold sign so more than  half a dozen of us lined up outside gold office too small for more than  people to wait for one person to find us cars  finally after  mins a second person came to help  after a significant wait i was asked if i really needed a fullsized car as requested  since it was apparent something else would be quicker i took what they offered of course smaller not more luxurious the car was fine  however the return experience on friday afternoon was just as miserable  perhaps more so since i was now running late for my flight   first of all clt airport you need a traffic light at the intersection near the  hertz return entrance  it took about  mins to get across the street thankfully and airport official car coincidentally came by and let cars that needed to go straight into the lot cross   and then we waited another  mins for a bus to take us to the terminal  bad planning hertz if i didnt have tsa percheck or had to check a bag im not sure i would have made my flight   totally unacceptable service  thats an oxymoron with hertz charlotte
