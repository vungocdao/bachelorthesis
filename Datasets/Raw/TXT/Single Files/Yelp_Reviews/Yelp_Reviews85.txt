didnt eat herethis review not about the food  we went on friday night around pm there seemed to be about  occupancy  the hostess asked us if we had a reservation we didnt  and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait  minutes  wtf  we immediately left and frankly its not worth going back again  shame the fish was good there crappy hostess for sure
