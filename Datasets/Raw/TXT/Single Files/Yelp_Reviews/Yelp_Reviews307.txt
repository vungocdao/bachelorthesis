what a place my wife and i came for lunch and left with a new favorite restaurant we dont eat out much but when it comes to sushi we definitely are picky   we showed up early as it was an early day all around for us this place is quaint and just kind of tucked back in the corner of the arboretum we started off lunch with a crunchy california roll as we really didnt know what to get first with the huge menu selection they offer the sushi was phenomenal with just the right amount of everything but not really being in a sushi mood we didnt give any of their amazing sushi a try yet we both decided on the hibachi chicken which came with so much food it was hard to eat it all and the price was so low it was perfect the vegetables and meat were cooked great and the taste was just right my wife is extremely picky about vegetables and she ate them all with the soup and salad and all the other things i dint have any clue why we got the sushi roll im very impressed with this place and will definitely be coming back now for the long wait until next time
