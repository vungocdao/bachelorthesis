craving thaiish and need a quick lunch hit up bangkok ocha son   i met hubs here for a very speedy lunch where their lunch special includes iced tea house soup and a noodle dish wegg roll for  oh and it comes out in about  minutes flat thats fast   and the food not too shabby the house soup is a total bust for me  its a corn egg drop soup yeah not sure where that came from but it tastes like a watered down egg chowder for me ill pass on that but i ordered the pad see ew which on their menu reads pud see ew and it was quite tasty a generous portion of chopped up flat rice noodles with a soy sauce base a bit of broccoli and bits of tender chicken considering it was lunch and i still had meetings to get to i asked for a star spice level out of  stars and it had quite a bit of heat   the service is quick and efficient and they definitely know how to turn those tables around during lunch time while its not my favorite thai food in charlotte its a nice quick and affordable option in south charlotte
