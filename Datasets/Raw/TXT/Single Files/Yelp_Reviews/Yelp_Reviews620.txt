everyone already knows how awesome montys blue plate diner is so i dont have to tell you that your carnivore and herbivore friends will love the menu they source local ingredients cook real food and even bring in local products such as yumbutter and create extra superduper healthy menu items by partnering with jon hinds at monkey bar gym  however i write this review because i recently ate the most amazing curry dish there ive been craving it ever since and cannot wait to return im serious it was a hot steaming bowl of freshly steamed vegetables with rice and a fantastic curry sauce i want to eat this every day our server even told me that she actually does eat this every day and has since they put it on their menu it was a huge bowl so i took half of it home with me so i could enjoy a second meal of leftovers   now drop everything and order this curry  and order a piece of pie or enjoy an iced sugar cookie too
