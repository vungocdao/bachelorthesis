im from chicago and dying for some fantastic tasting ribs other than those that i bbq myself everyone pointed me to honey bears bbq  the place is clean and casual and the service is ok but the ribs were horrible the beer was fantastic though and i first thought maybe the alcohol had dulled my taste buds i remember screaming either this is a poor cut of beefpork or both animals had mad cowpig disease  i decided to return and give them another chance and not order alcohol i ordered the ribs and again mad cow disease  i wont ever return how does that go first time shame on you second time shame on me
