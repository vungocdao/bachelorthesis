well i went to school here and loved it and i feel like i got a great education it may be huge but once you find your niche you will do just fine you just have to make sure you go to class and take good notes because most classes are so huge they wont harass you to come yet just expect you to i loved the big ten games and the energy of the campus i would never have picked a different place to spend four years
