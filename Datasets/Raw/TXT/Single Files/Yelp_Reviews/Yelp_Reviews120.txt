i used to buy la prima espresso for my pavoni all the time so i was pretty excited to actually get a cup of coffee here  i ordered a cappuccino  it tasted like milk and no coffee  i was exceptionally disappointed  so while the place has a great reputation  even they can screw it up if they dont pay attention to detail and  at this level they should never screw it up i had a better cup at martys market for crying out loud
