umno  chips are obviously from bags  salsa were runny and definitely not spicy  remember  made in new york city  i had the carne asada  it was ok  i usually devour the entire place but i just couldnt get into it  the rice was bland  overall it was just disappointing  i should have just eaten at qdoba which was nearby  service was mediocre   moral just because it is right next to the hotel doesnt mean food is gonna be awesome
