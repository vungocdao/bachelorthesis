this is the first time yelp reviews have let me down i tried this new location due to the reviews and being  mins from my job i opted for a manicure and shellac three days later the shellac cracked and began to peel i called the salon and they asked i return and have the shellac redone i did and the following day the shellac was cracking and peeling this has never happened to me with any shellac or other type of gels this was a waste of money and especially time
