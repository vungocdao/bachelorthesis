walking into macayos is like entering a buffet restaurant in a vegas casino tacky tacky tacky loud wall paper lots of different rooms and the people oh the people men in hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys women with big hair and lots of screaming kids staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly standard mexican fare is widely available stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy the carnitas entree is a sad clump of dry porkgee i think thats the same thing my uncle larry said of his third ex wife anyhoo the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu you have to ask for it served with a variety of blue yellow and red corn chips the dippin is fun and filling the guacamole is pretty good although it seems theres a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit i really like the mini chicken chimichangas the minis not the regular sized the latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper macayos is a family owned famous phoenix restaurant landmark the central ave location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the deelish factor my recommendation is two shots of chilled patron before the food and everything seems better hola and adios
