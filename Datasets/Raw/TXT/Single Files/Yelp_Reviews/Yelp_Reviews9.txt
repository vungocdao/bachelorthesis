like any barnes  noble it has a nice comfy cafe and a large selection of books  the staff is very friendly and helpful  they stock a decent selection and the prices are pretty reasonable  obviously its hard for them to compete with amazon  however since all the small shop bookstores are gone its nice to walk into one every once in a while
