this restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance that is where the positive ends the food is lousy i paid  for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen ok it was thawed but had previously been frozen corn about  tablespoons of black beans and the same amount of feta as a vegetarian this salad was one of two that had some sort of substance to make one think of a meal what a disappointment  i wont be back
