love this place who wouldve thought id be reviewing a library  the building is so cool and modern inside so many places to lounge a cafe an outdoor area to chill and the best thing of all for me is that there is a huge play area in the childrens section with toys puzzles and books galore i havent had to buy too many books for my little one shes  now instead i check out  to  books per every  weeks for her to enjoy and they are all usually in good shape plus they have a free baby time class there where we can bring our babies the instructors are so talented they sing and read books to our babies they also bring toys for them to play with my little girl loves it and loves to be with the other babies as well awesome
