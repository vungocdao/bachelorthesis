i hate to put two stars but i have experienced better especially for the price this was my first visit and frankly it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant  there were definitely good points the service was great and i enjoyed the cocktail that i ordered off the menu also they had a couple of lesserknown cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing the wine by the glass menu had nice choices too  unfortunately the food was mixed i had the pork dumplings for an appetizer the combination of flavors in the filling dip and wrapper was very good but the wrapper was unusually thick and distractingly chewy even gummy as in it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy the server said theyd just started making their wrappers inhouse and i think they need some work  i had the chicken ramen soup for a main course it just wasnt very good i didnt expect it to be up to vancouver bc standards that city seems to have a thing for ramen but the noodles were a bit tough and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt this includes the broth and the chicken i didnt really want to eat i
