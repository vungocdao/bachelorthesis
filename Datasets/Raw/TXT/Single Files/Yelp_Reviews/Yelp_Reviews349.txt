mimosa is fantastic i went there for lunch recently for my friends birthday i had the best cheeseburger ive ever had in my life it was topped with bacon and cheddar cheese but the burger itself was just seasoned perfectly mm mm it is on the pricey side but its definitely more reasonably priced for lunch so id recommend checking it out then as other yelpers have said its just one of those restaurants where everything you order is likely to be good
