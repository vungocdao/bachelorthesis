i like to focus on the positive so lets start there the hot wings get em spicy hot they were really good worth going here for no  its a dark bar my date liked the english vibe of it  the waitresses were slow but pleasant with bringing the drinks and once we did get them the drinks sucked i ordered a irish car bomb and got less than half a glass of warm guiness with the tiniest shot of baileyswhiskey it was almost undrinkable then i ordered the  drink shot special which tasted like a shot of koolaid  we went for the monday karaoke and the dj was good enough but there was this little tv in the corner with the lyrics displayed ive just been to better karaoke bars ie ernies  like i said my date liked this place so i guess ymmv i think i would have liked it more if the service was better and the drinks were up to par
