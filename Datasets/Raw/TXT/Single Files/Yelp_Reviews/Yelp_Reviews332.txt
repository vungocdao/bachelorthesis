im maybe im missing something here because i found the place to be really underwhelming the service was excellent friendly and fast but the food was    eh i kept getting a chemical taste off of the food and im not normally someone who is sensitive to that kind of thing i got the brisket tacos and they ended up being  kind of chemical artificial tasting and  watery from the salsa not really a good combination maybe i chose poorly but i wasnt impressed at all
