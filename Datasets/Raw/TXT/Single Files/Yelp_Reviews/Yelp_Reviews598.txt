opinions are a changing  went to pedros over the weekend  tamales were not good  the sauce had formed a skin on the top because it sat under the heat lamps too long  i took three bites before i found any pork  i ate half of one and the waiter asked if i wanted to take the rest home  when i said no my satisfaction was not questioned  ill stick with laredos
