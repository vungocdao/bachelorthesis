i lived in pittsburgh for four years and have never been to ds but i visited recently and went with some friends what lured me was the promise of veggie dogs and burgers and i was not let down i got two hot dogsa chicago and a mac and cheese really really good my boyfriend ordered the red alert dog his was meat and his face basically melted off but he insisted he loved it then he said the spices may or may not have traveled to his tear ducts but to each his own he had a great time my two friends also got the mac and cheese veggie dog and loved it  the beer cave is awesome  id love to give ds five stars but like a couple of people mentioned the service is lacking everyone is friendly but i had to walk around and find our server so i could pay and then find him again when he didnt return it took us a while to get water refills too the dining area and the bar are separated and it seems like the servers congregate in one place and leave the other vacant at any given time very nice people though
