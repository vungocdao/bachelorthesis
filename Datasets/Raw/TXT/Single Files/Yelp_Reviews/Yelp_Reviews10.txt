meh ive experienced better is an understatement  fridays is like the fine dining chain for every yinzer in pittsburgh    when we were seated it was quick which was a surprise  somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why  i was happy about that   i ordered one of their skinny margaritas blackberry to be exact  it was a nice size however at pop that was half of my food bill   the waitress started off attentive but after our food came out she was gone  i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard  loaded mashed potato on the side because i wanted heartburn ha   food came  my burger had lettuce on it only  waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks  i had to wait to ask for my pickle   the loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what i was expecting  disappointment   the waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check    never again will i eat at fridays  i will however go should a happy hour arise
