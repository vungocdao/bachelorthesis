i have only been here a few times service is pretty good but my big problem is the shakes first time i got a shake it was really thick and almost worth the  bucks i looked forward to having another some day last friday i went there for another shake and it was really thin like chocolate milk maybe when teenagers are making milk shakes for minimum wage you get varied results  is way too much for a watery shake get it together people
