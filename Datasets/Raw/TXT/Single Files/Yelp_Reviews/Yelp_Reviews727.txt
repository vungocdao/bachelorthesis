coming from california these are the cheapest drinks ive ever encountered we called ahead of time to ask them to play the niners game even though the bears  packers were the favored game of the day and time they had a tv set up all ready with the niners game when i got there  there are peanut shells all over the ground which i find a little tacky and dangerous the pizza was pretty decent  thin crust we ordered the hawaiian although we substituted bbq sauce for regular pizza tomato sauce  there are fun pool tables and other arcade games a jukebox for your favorite tunes can be found near the bar i think  this place seems to be a staple of downtown champaign
