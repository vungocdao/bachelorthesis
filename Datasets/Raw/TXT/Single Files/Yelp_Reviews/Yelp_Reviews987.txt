stopped into this shop during spring training  the staff was nice but he really pushed the kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop  we bought  of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them  the cigars didnt draw well and were generally not very good  we went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent  there the day before and only bought the kristoffs on their recommendation at  a stick  we wont be going back
