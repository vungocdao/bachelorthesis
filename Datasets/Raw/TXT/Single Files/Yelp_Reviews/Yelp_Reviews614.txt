looking for a big hearty breakfast then look no further because this place has got exactly what youre looking for and for a pretty reasonable price i went here with my friend after a night of ahem good old madison weekend fun and this was exactly what we needed i got the eggs mornay which has this sausage patty and poached eggs with this very nice sauce on top of an english muffin and if that wasnt enough carbs for you it comes with a generous helping of fried potatoes good stuff  also a random note despite its appearance as an old fashioned diner i got a very hipstery vibe from it once i got in
