this place is way overrated they let ur car sit for  minutes before they even start to dry it  by this time the water spots are already dry and they miss spots in the front or sides all the time  their armor all has gone down as well  they used to have the best tire gloss that would last for  days now they use a cheaper brand thats dull  this place has really gone down over the years  again way overrated   second vacuum pfffff
