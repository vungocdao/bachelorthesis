dont go to this store  the service is always poor the people working there are unfriendly dont know what they are selling where anything is located and to top it off you are likely to be overcharged  so if you do go you best check your receipt  plus they tend to get in your face when questioned about store policy  sure they have the food i want but i can get it in a different friendly store  lose the attitude  what ever happened to good quality customer service
