wow this place is excellent  i grew up in charlotte and sadly never discovered this place until after i moved away i heard a couple of great recommendations and my family decided to try it out   the meal starts out with some outstanding cornbread so buttery it seems light and almost melts in your mouth we also got a fried green tomato appetizer which was really good between the four of us we had  orders of salmon cakes delish fried chicken and ribs and probably one of each of the sides i would definitely recommend the salmon cakes again fried chicken and ribs are a bit heavy for me but my dad and brother went to town everything was really good and made me lament living so far away from good southern cookin  then there was dessert while my mom brother and i were unbuttoning the top button of our pants and trying to make a little bit more room my dad was going strong we ended up with a slice of sweet potato cake divine and a slice of coconut cake to take home for later the waitress told us that all of the cakes are made by a woman in her home and we could just imagine what her house must smell like   our server was super friendly and comfortabl
