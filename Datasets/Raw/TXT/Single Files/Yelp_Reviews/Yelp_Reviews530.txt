my wife and i ate here this evening for our th anniversary  the interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations the menu had also changed with some items doubling in price  a coworker of my wife had given her a  gift card for christmas we ordered sweet teas and a bloomin onion the onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning  my wife had the chicken tenders and i had the pork tenderloin  it wa a good but wasnt outstanding at one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table he didnt introduce himself he asked about our meal and disappeared i told the waiter about him we were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the french toast bread pudding looked delicious
