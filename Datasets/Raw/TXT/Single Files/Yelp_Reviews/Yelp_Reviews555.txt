staff  the most kind hotel staff ive had the chance to meet  atmosphere was down to earth professional and efficient  a well oiled staff no matter who was at the front desk  all policies stayed the same from person to person  id like to make special mention of joe staffer who didnt rush me off but listened to my request and immediately went into action to do research and obtain information about relocating to the area  joe was a positive person and nothing but a gentleman  southern hospitality does still exist  facility  no noise  i mean absolutely no noise from the hall or surrounding rooms  parking was plentiful and easily accessibl
