i got a groupon for dean of shadyside for hairline highlights deep conditioning masque and a hair cut for   i had never been but i gave it a try  the groupon was for a level  stylist and i had erika  she was pretty great  ive never had highlights before and she helped me figure out what would look good  my highlights look great the cut looks great she did exactly what i wanted her to do  i never make hair appointments far in advance but i prebooked my next appointment  i would highly recommend this place and i recommend erika as well
