attended the ancient ales modern science event with several others and was very disappointed  the ancient ales that we had the privilege of tasting were fantastic but unfortunately only  or  of the breweries made it the whole  hours we spent most of our night waiting in line for the breweries whose booths were open and didnt get a chance to see much of the science center thankfully i was with good company
