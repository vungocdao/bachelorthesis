though the freedom dr kmart looks like the setting of a postapocalyptic film and the entire chain is past its prime you can find some trinkets for cheap on the inside    this kmart has some affordable home furninishing knockoffs by cheap i mean cheaper than targetikea  while it some of it is dated kmart still carries the muchtouted martha stewart brands  ive found a runner rug and bedspread that both look like something from department stores  the same can be said for the furniture so dont hate on my stylish house   the clothing department is slightly dicier but i have scavenged some faddish clothes think gap  years ago among the big bubba tshirts and overalls  their young mens section has good deals at the end of the season like utility shirts or those really metrosexual bootcut jeans for less than   yeahreally  the rest of the store is pretty much filler  if you actually go to this kmart  or any kmart looking for a decent selection of sporting goodsshoeselectronics you will likely pay more than other big box retailers or be appalled by the selection  if youre like me and approach kmart shopping like thrift store diving you will be pleasantly surprised cant decide then if visiting kmart is frugal or frivolous but who doesnt need another cheap belt
