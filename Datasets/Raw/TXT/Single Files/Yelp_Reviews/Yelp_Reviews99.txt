even a nyer was telling me to get tacos here so i did pretty good loaded more than im used to they make their own tortillas which is respectable its fun to watch people order tacos here this is a real taste of mexico and it seemed new to half of them pittsburgh is a great town because the vendors arent afraid to give the people something real  they even have tongue   that chinese food truck across the street though its good but way americanized
