i had great expectations that were sadly not met for the price of the room i was expecting a lot more for my buck maybe i was just too optimistic i will say the whole hotel was clean and didnt have any unsanitary conditions but it just seemed outdate for the top price paid it could use a spruce up our room was ready before posted checkin time and when we got to the room there were no problems the wifi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good i would say this is an average hotel for amenities with a high price tag  usually when you pay top tier rates i usually expect the service staff to be very friendly didnt get that here i think i had one of the service staff actually talk to me unsolicited i would not revisit the westin convention center  my wife would probably give it  star just for the shower head it was pretty amazing but when that is the highlight i dont think there is value here
