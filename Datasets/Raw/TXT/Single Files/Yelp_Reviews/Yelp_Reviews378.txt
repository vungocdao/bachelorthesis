the toenail in the carpeting and booger on the desk told me all i needed to know about the omni  i wont even go into the mildewy bathroom ceiling   i can scarcely believe this is an omni after staying at pittsburgs omni  the lobby is beautiful but they have a long way to go to be a decent hotel  there are swatches out all over the place connoting a redecoration but i wonder if its all because the ritz is being built across the street
