i like to refer to this place as the key shack if you drive by thats exactly what it looks like a little shack in the middle of park road shopping center it make look a little sketch there was some homemade bbq for sale next to the shack when i was here a few weekends ago but they get the job done  i went here after a referral from a friend i was looking for a hard to find key to duplicate for one of the uptown residential buildings sure enough they had the key here i had a new key and exchanged cash in about  minutes if you have a hard to find key to duplicate  this is your spot  plus one youre done you can stroll through the rest of park road shopping center if you so desire cupcakes coffee michaels antiques its all here
