i adopted a dog a few months ago she is a  year old border collie lab mix named lily i know when the dogs are given up the humane society relies on the former family being honest about the dogs behavior i was told she was a friendly sweet lap dog that has never had issues with other animals she gets along with my cat great but when other dogs come along on walks she flips out she even attacked one recently im positive she was abused by her previous family cchs didnt take great care of her either her pads were all torn in her front paws which had her limping for the first few weeks her gums bled like crazy and her teeth were in awful condition and she was too skinny we were ready to give her back because of the strain it put us through we have since turned her around with training and gotten her back to full health but it took hundreds and hundreds of dollars
