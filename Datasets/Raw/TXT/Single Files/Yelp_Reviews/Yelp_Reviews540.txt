the location is right on across the street from uncc and next store to brueggers i have spent many of nights cramming for a test or getting my caffeine fix before work since this starbucks is very small and always busy you have to keep you eye on a table and pounce when one comes available the baristas are my favorite in charlotte they have pretty much memorized my order theyre speedy and always friendly good thing starbucks is building a larger location in the same shopping center
