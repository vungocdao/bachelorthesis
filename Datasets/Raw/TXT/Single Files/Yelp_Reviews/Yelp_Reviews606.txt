this place is huge and that is good because it can get packed pretty quickly on the weekends this is especially true when the weather outside forces us to look for indoor activities   unlike the previous poster i initially had a hard time figuring out the computer seated at the table i kept jamming my fat little fingers onto the screen expecting a touch screen response fortunately the other bowlers in my party realized that my genius was showing and helped me figure it out durrrrrr   the bowling was fun even though i probably should have had the bumpers on like the minors in our group did at least then i would have not looked liked the biggest dork in three counties just a weeny   we ordered deep fried cheese curds and deep fried macaroni for snacking no healthy eating here they were yummy and just as good as culvers but since ive said that now ill have to hide from rabid culvers fans yikes   well go here again and i can once again provide comic relief with my mad bowling skillz   werd
