had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years  we shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps  both were delicious and im freaking thrilled when a restaurant knows what a caramelized onion is supposed to look like  my flatbread was smothered in them just the way i like it  the sashimi was nothing crazy i liked the grilled pineapple with it    my husband got himself a burger the barbecue one to be exact and i had the wild mushroom pasta  i was concerned it would be too similar to the flatbread but the server raved about it so i tried it anyway    my husband enjoyed his burger though he thought it could have been less salted  he was happy that the temperature was correct also   the salad that came with my entree was ok  the blue cheese dressing was eh the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda squishy and i actually spit out a crouton  it had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil  i usually love croutons too  the pasta was tasty but almost too tasty if that makes sense  too many competing flavors  my husband was thrilled that they got al dente right when he had a bite  id also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch but there arent a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat  overall id eat here again and get the same apps and a lighter entree
