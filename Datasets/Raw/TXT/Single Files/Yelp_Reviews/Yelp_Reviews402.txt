i have to disagree with these other reviews  presbyterian is a joke  unfortunately our primary care physician is right around the corner and affiliated with presbyterian as well and so any time they want to order up something that they cant handle in the office guess where they send us  to make matters worse the place is always full or overfull always understaffed and always incapable of handling anything  the emergency department is horrid but to make matters worse its better than being admitted  in one of the worst cases of mismanagement ever what should have been a simple examination  passed from our regular doctor  ended up being at least  hours in the emergency room while we waited for a regular room then several days yes days in the hospital itself while they proceeded to run a whopping one test per day  thats right  one test per day  the test would usually be run in midmorning and the results would come back midafternoon at which point they would try and find someone to interpret the test results which could take until after dinner and by the time that happened it would be night time and then another test would be ordered for the next day  it was simply pathetic  whatever you do do not go to the emergency room at presbyterian
