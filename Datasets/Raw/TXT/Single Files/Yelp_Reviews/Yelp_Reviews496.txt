laser quest is a fun experience for kids of all ages but the adults that play at this establishment honestly kind of creep me out  the best time to bring your children here is during the middle of the week because there is always an abundance of birthday parties on the weekend and it can take hours before you are able to participate  each game is about fifteen minutes long and the setup is fairly large with many areas to run around and attack friends  bring your childhood self here for a good clean time
