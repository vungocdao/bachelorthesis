the beer was pretty good but the food was a real disappointment i have always enjoyed the beer at rock bottom and miss their location in atlanta buckhead we sent back the guacamole because it was warm from sitting under a heat lamp i had the pizza and it was mediocre at best  the wings were fine but nothing special  the restaurant was busy but wasnt packed   our food took a long time to come out  we were sitting near the kitchen and could see a number of items sitting under the heat lamps for  minutes  it seemed like the kitchen was putting the food out fast enough but the servers werent getting the food to the tables
