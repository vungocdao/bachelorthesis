two words overpriced and understaffed  im not sure if palazzo is always open sometimes or just recently reopened but theyve brought back the goth night one friday a month just to clarifynot reviewing that particular dance night just the establishment itself   every time i have been the bar has been understaffed two for an entire nightclub that is packed how does that work it takes forever to get a drink and then its just generally expensive no matter what you get theres also a back bar that seems to never be in use with the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night youd think theyd hire a few extra people   also maybe invest in some misters for your back barit gets ridiculously hot back there when its packed full of people its almost as if this is a bare bones establishment its sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that its at which used to be tranzylvania back in the day just plain sucks
