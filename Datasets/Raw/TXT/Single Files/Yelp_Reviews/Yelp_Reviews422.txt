so earlier this year i bought a coupon off of google offers for cajun queen i had never been here and wanted to try it so  for  worth of food was a great incentive it took me until last week to give it a try   the atmosphere was dark and a bit drab the art on the walls was nice but i was here for food the menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive the prices were on the high side of expensive thank goodness for the coupon   service was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere i could have used a smile from someone but it didnt come the portions that came with my meal were just the way i like them not too much but enough for a good dinner the flavor of the oysters and shrimp was above satisfactory   all in all the trip was worth it but with the coupon i would have kicked myself if i had to pay full price for the experience received that being said i doubt i will be returning on my own accord
