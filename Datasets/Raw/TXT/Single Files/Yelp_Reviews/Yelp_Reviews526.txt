we loved our thai place in boston and really missed having someplace to go get pad thai we moved into the area and found this place and fell in love with it  the inside of the restaurant is beautiful and really clean the staff are all really nice and attentive they have takeout which works for us since we live a few blocks away  i thought the food was great weve tried a few different meals my wife does not enjoy very spicy food and the mild versions suit her fine i do like my food spicy and if i had one complaint its that i wouldnt mind if the spicy dishes were a little hotter than what ive experienced so far the food has great flavors and think it is spot on
