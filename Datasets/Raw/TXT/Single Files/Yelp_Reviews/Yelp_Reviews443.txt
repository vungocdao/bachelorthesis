so honest moment i was actually here for another event but what a treat it was to have it hosted such a great venue   while we waited for our event to start we were able to walk around and read a little history on the planes and models that were there by far the best attraction was the plane that was in route to charlotte and landed on the hudson after seeing the damages and reading the stories this was nothing short of a miracle   another really cool feature is that they have preserved personal items from the passengers and flight crew which is a really nice touch if youre into history aviation or just want to know more about this memorable flightyoull want to visit here
