on yelp a th review is a milestone  its a big deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews its a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  fairpoint communications is such a business  fairpoint took over verizons local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver  in a nutshell it has been a disaster  fairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up  they got the new business when my office moved to portsmouth  one day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service  when that was fixed the lines didnt roll over properly  the billing was never correct  the internet connection required rebooting the dsl modem up to  times a day  calls about all of these issues rarely went well  people were apologetic but problems remained  calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers  two different people in my office were reduced to tears  most people and companies i know with fairpoint in new hampshire and maine are having similar troubles  my company switched carriers recently  fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened  someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then everything has worked perfectly  to fairpoints management i can only say that you bit off more than you could chew  whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didnt care  i hope you are fined out of existence  to new hampshires public utility commission i have to say that i have no idea what you do  i should review you separately  i dont generally give out onestar reviews  this is my th review and only my th onestar review  im not giving details because all of the billing issues arent resolved but i will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in northern new england fairpoint is not the company you want to go with
