i have been to the ultimate several times for massages with ellen and would highly recommend her  she is very personable friendly and professional  i feel extremely relaxed after our sessions  i also used ellen for a prenatal massage when pregnant being as big and uncomfortable as i was i was worried if i would be able to relax fully  ellen has blankets and pillows just for that reason super comfortable and she remembers to ask about the baby after she was born highly recommend  the only reason i did not give  stars was that the hallway outside the room can get a bit loud if people are walking down talking or laughing they should maybe make that more of a quiet space with notices that people are in session  nothing ellen could help though
