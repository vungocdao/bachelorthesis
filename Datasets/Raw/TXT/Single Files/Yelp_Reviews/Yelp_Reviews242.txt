never had any experience with rudeness here or any other problem they make the best beans and greens around and i order this dish at every italian restaurant  brothy just the right amount of saltiness and just right for sopping up whatevers left on the plate with their delicious crusty bread  the salad with gorgonzola is also pretty amazing  a great neighborhood standby
