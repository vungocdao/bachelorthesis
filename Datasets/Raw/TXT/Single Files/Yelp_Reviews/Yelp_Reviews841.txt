tickets to phoenix suns games are cheaper than the large beer in a cup at the arena  tickets and  brews i used to watch this arena on tv for years when the suns were good and i was living elsewhere it seems less orange in person maybe some of the seats should be painted orange too if you know the area you will know not too pay for parking either after pm meters are free and obviously on the sunday i went no charge try parking at th and monroe street inside the arena is pretty nice i had a great view from the upper deck but cmon suns do you really need ushers kicking people out of upper level seats give somebody a tiny bit of power and see what they do with it of course im stealthy and uncatchable so no senior citizen usher is telling me where to sit anyway my team the brooklyn nets won and overall a good no hassle experience if the suns ever get good again it will be worse to attend oh yeah good entertainment also at least on this day it was the gorillas birthday and a ton of mascots were there celebrating and also the trampoline dunkers were cool and the  yearold girl who sang the anthem was top notch
