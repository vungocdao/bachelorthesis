youll notice a huge age discrepency really young kids and then there are the adults of all ages  so i give credz to any insitution that tries to keep kids engaged in using their minds  vs getting their game on in the mall  i love science museums making a point to attend in any big city i travel to  the exhibits seem lacking even in simple terms of the magic behind the science hence probably why the feedback this place is so kids orientated
