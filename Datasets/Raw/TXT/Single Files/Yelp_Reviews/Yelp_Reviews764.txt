what can i say about comedor that hasnt already been said the food is reasonably priced and the selection is huge back in the day before i started telecommuting a margarita or beer paired with one of their daily specials have gotten me through more than one long assed afternoon at work please dont tell my boss  the wait staff is incredibly nice and watching newbies squint under the bright lights and bad south of the boarder art is always entertaining  if you want to be a little bold try one of their soups they are scarrier than shit if you are a white girl that grew up on meat and potatoes but they taste great i just dont ask whats in it lol
