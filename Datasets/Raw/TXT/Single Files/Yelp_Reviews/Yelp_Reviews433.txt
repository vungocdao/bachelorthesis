i like clt  this airport is large and has a lot of people going through it and there are many places to stop in grab lunch or dinner and get to your next stop  i normally dont have much time to hang out here but i have been to a couple restaurants and they were clean and fast  i especially like the fact this airport has six starbucks locations  if you are flying from charlotte try the a concourse tsa line it is usually shorter
