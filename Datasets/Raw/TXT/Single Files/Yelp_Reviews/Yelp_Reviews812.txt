i enjoyed the arizona ultimate womens expo  it was something that of course was geared towards women but i saw several men there as well  i must have entered at least  drawings  deidre hall was great  its an even better time if you can get a few girlfriends to go with you  there were  different stations for alcohol samples  some of them were good some not so much like the senorita limonita  that was horrible  if anyone plans on going in the future plan ahead  i totally didnt even think about the diamondbacks playing  i had to drive a little bit further for parking which was worth it  it only cost me  whereas every other lot or garage i saw was  or   also take your time when walking through the expo  theres so much to see and do  find out when the keynote speakers go on and when demos are so that you can get the most out of it
