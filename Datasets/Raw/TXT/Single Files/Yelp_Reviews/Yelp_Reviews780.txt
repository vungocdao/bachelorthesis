i wont be back here again  ever    can one give less that  star   it is a bummer as i used to frequent this place as it is conveniently located for me  pamela the bartender is a sweetheart and works hard to recognize people by name   personalized service like hers helped me to overlook issues like the significant cleanliness challenges that are easy to spot if you look around   if you think i am joking go into the bar and look up a the light fixtures   that fuzzy stuff is probably  years of dust  carpets are dingy and smells like old beer  this place rocks as a nightclub on weekends i dont think that cleanliness is the priorityanyhowi spent a lot of money there over the years mainly for lunch or after work cocktails with friends  never more not because of the issues outlined above but it is beacuse how i was treated when visiting the establishment not long ago   pamela was not working that day sadly and the male bartender decided that he was more interested in lecturing me on his beliefs than he was in serving my drinks and taking my money  he had an issue and apparently i was the target and cause of his rantings   he was sad about the lack of customers and decided it was my fault as i mentioned i worked downtown   his rants about downtown businesses was unorthodox and uncalled for   i drank my beer and hurried out reminding myself never to set foot in the place again  no wonder they are lacking for customers    there are more and more restaurants downtown  time to step it up or get out of the way matador
