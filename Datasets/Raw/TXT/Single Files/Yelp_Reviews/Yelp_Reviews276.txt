food was ok it wasnt bad just nothing great its like the place tries too hard they walk you in through the kitchen cute but gimmicky the place is overfilled with photos and artwork they are nice photos but its distracting almost on purpose as if the food is not the real star of the show it shows in the flavors the service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu my server lost me towards the end he was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him all in all it was ok more focus on food and flavors and less on cliche its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal nothing to remember
