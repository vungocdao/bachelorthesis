ive heard this restaurant from listening to npr in charlotte so i went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out here are my reviews  venue  the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in japan if you have a large group of people your group will be sitting as if youre sitting on a floor but your not the sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open its a comfortable sitting arrangement  sushi  the unagi eel was cooked perfectly the softcrab shells are not bad but i had better ones before  the rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy they need better selections in sushi  presentation  the restaurant lacks in presentation  it was a very simple dish put together    sake  they are pricey  minimum   ramen  the soup was very tasty    overall  if you are craving for ramen this is the best place so far ive tasted as for sushi i would only come here once ive had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in california before  i still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in california also if you dont tip enough you will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip its a mandatory  it feels like a teacher is about to scold you
