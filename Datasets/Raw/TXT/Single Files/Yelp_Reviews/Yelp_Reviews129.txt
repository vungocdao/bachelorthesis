so fun to have a place like this in the strip  i just found out that they have chocolate oranges  i look for these in all the stores during christmas and never thought to come here  well they have white milk and dark chocolate varieties available yearround  i love the dark chocolate but only because i didnt know the other two kinds existed  they also have canisters of malted milk balls unique chocolates from all over seasonal items and a cafeish area  i didnt try the hot chocolate but i hear its a musthave  while we walked around the small store three different salespeople asked if we were finding everything okay  possibly because i kept taking pictures to instagram and i didnt realize until after i left that theres a sign asking patrons not to take pictures ooops  but no one said anything and they were polite so thumbs up for the service here
