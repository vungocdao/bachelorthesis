i lived here my freshman year and it definitely wasnt my favorite  the rooms are big so at first bromley felt like a good deal  however i quickly learned that the walls are thin probably just two sheets of drywall and you can hear every sound from the room next door  even on weeknights students often yelled and ran through the halls at  or  am    as an engineer i had  calculus most mornings  so i found it impossible to get much sleep and i often found myself sleeping in friends apartments instead  if your goal is to party constantly this is your dorm  if youre interested in getting some sleep bromley hall is not your best bet
