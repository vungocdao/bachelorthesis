ok but they do not go out of their way to help i didnt have a credit card so at first they said i couldnt check in finally they allowed me to put down cash then i went to breakfast and the shuttle refused to pick us up because roads were too bad we waited for  minutes at the restaurant no cabs could pick us up so i called the hotel and explained our situation had to get to work soon  mth pregnant woman with me only a mile and a half away he said he couldnt help we had to walk while the snow blew in our faces when we were almost there we saw the shuttle pull out with the smoking shuttle driver in it driving in the opposite direction away from us i cannot believe how rude they were
