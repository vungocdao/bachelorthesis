me and my wife have a membership to the zoo  and well  would totally recommend it to everyone  we use it all the time  heck i would go every week if she would let me  there is just something about sitting at the zoo  in the weather  with the people   enjoying the day  not all animals look happy there or comfortable for that matter but some really do look like they are oblivious that they are at the zoo  it is a huge zoo  it would take most the day to see all of it  it is so relaxing to just go for a coulpe of hours and then leave  we have been where we didnt see anyone for  minutes and on the busiest day and never felt that there were crowd problems  the zoo does does seem to do too much to just want your money  you pay a good fee to get in and then there are places everywhere to take more money from you  opportunity cost eh  my current favoirtes are the big horn sheep up in the corner  and just sitting and watching the movement at the savana  it is like my crack  some people sit by the pool and relax  i site by the savana and relax
