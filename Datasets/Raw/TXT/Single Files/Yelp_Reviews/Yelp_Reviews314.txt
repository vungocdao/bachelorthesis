i recently attended a wedding at the charlotte city club and it was gorgeous not only is it a beautiful venue with a fabulous view but the meal was highquality hands down the best macaroni and cheese on the planet it was definitely one of the best dinners ive had at a wedding they also did a great job of ushering everyone to the reception and the service was excellent  reason for  stars  i wondered if the bride and groom were paying based on consumption because the drinks were incredibly stiffoverly so i had to ask them to water mine down more than a few times  also the top floor can accommodate several people but there are a few rooms rather than one large one so we missed out on the cake cutting because we were in the room with the band for that reason i would prefer a location with one large space for a wedding reception but overall it was a very beautiful space
