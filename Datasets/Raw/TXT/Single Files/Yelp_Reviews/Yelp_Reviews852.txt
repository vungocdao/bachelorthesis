stumbled across this place while working a photo shoot in the area and we ordered in  since then we havent stopped eating at athenian express   a good five miles out of the way    what attracted us  great food great prices and the owners wife was undeniable friendly  seriously one of the genuinely nicest people i have ever met   i started out with the turkey pita  delicious yet she urged me to be more creative   love it all now including the staff   there isnt a day where it isnt hussle and bussle in the place  yet the service is fast and always accurate  seriously i eat it almost every day
