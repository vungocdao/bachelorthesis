magnifico  great little place tucked away in a semiresidential area of town  felt like i was part of the family after being seated  bright cheerful atmosphere like a fiesta  food was very flavoful even the white rice  crab enchiladas full of white crab meat and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce  salsa you get red spicy and green mild with chips and i got a complimentary cerviche  the red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just the right kick of heat  cant wait to try other dishes when i return to phoenix in a couple of weeks
