ri ra is one of the coolest bars in charlotte from a decorambiance perspective after work its loud and crowded and energetic  exactly as it should be   what i really wish is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance i ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes  cottage pie what i was served was sparse ground beef frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes i know they were frozen mixed vegetables because i really dont think corn is typically used in cottage pie its just not that hard to make cottage pie or shepherds pie with lamb even in a restaurant environment   stick with a jamesons or guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner
