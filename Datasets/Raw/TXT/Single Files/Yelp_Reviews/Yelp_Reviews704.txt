this place is the worst  of course its beautiful and has a great selection of booksso long as you dont mind living under the most tyrannical librarian regime ever to live  every time i walk into this library i feel like im walking on eggshells wondering what rule i might break next and god forbid they catch your child with a goldfish cracker in the kids sectionoff with their heads  additionally once it was off limits to savoymahomet residents i felt unwelcome there and totally uncomfortable  i do have a grad student friend who had her feet slightly outside her sandals and got yelled at for it who the hell are these librarians to tell people how they need to sit or wear their shoes  and the childrens librarians are not friendly or nice with the kids but generally seem annoyed that anyone is even there i thought that was the point of a library to excite people about reading and give free access to all  champaign public library which it really isnt anymore is truly the most unfriendly library i have ever been to and i will never go back there again
