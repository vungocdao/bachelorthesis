im visiting charlotte for work and found this place through restaurantcom  im glad i did  i went with a friend from the area who was a little weary about its location but was pleasantly surprised by the inside  its cute and quaint with a touch of modern flair  we each started with a martini as they are all  dollars on thursdays normally   the waters didnt actually come until after the martinis which is a little backwards but the martinis were welcomed with open arms  and were yummy  the food came out quickly and hot i ordered the pasta primavera with creamy pesto and added shrimp  it was nicely flavored it was chalk full of goodies and the portion was more than enough  i was disappointed that i didnt have a fridge in my hotel to take home the leftovers  my friend ordered the grits  definitely a good dish but i would not recommend it to those who dont like spicy food because it had quite a cajun kick  all in all a good experience  check it out
