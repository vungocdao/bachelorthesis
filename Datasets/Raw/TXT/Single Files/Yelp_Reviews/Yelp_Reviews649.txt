i have given this place multiple tries now and finally have decided to give it a proper review general tsos is my go to dish for chinese take out an this place failed miserably on that nothing but over cooked chicken with a lot of sauce and breading and yucky skin yuck the lo mien was also horrible there was just no flavor what so ever and nothing but noodles and what looked to be whatever mysterious vegetable they had lying around  if i wanted to order leftovers i would order leftovers  there saving grace is their hot sour soup very tasty but i had one bad experience with it where i ordered a large to go and instead of telling me they only had enough for a small container they put the left overbottom of the pot in and filled it up only  of the way talk about shady service i even watched them do it from behind the counter trying to pull a fast one on me i think not  im still giving it a solid  stars because their egg rolls and ragoon were at least tasty too other than the tasty soup that is when they have it available but in all honestly nothing special i can go to any chinese take out joint and get the same thing any day of the week   so yeahif you want good chinese this is not the place i recommend if you want quick chinese just because your craving itwell maybe rethink it or just settle for the china inn
