so i had to play hotel switcheroo because hyatts rate seemingly tripled for one night in the middle of my stay i wound up here and i think im officially done with choice hotels forever ive never had a positive experience aside from this one econo lodge in walterboro sc  this hotel is located in the middle of a vast array of garbage food restaurants if you want to go to a grocery store theyre all  minutes away while the hotel might be convenient to some attractions it isnt convenient to things an everyday hotel guest would need or want unless you like mcdonalds and waffle house gross  the beds are not comfortable at all and this hotel has resorted to using these god awful square  pillows who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child its beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on pair the lack of comfort with the  check out and you have one unhappy guest i requested a late checkout time upon checkin as i advised id be working overnight  was the best she could do as she made some kind of apparently phantom note the next morning at exactly  the phone rang and reminded me that i was scheduled to check out that day and that check out was  blah so much for sleeping inn at sleep inn  the hotel is quite noisy as it borders i and the immediate area isnt all that great noise from other guests was relatively nil though  the mini freezer and mini fridge were nice but it didnt make up for the overall room quality the hotel wifi averages  mbps down mbps up and is complimentary  not recommended and officially denied going forward
