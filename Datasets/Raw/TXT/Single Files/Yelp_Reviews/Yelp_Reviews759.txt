huge disappointment stopped for a quick dinner before a show ordered  burgers medium they came out extremely well done  the buns were hard  dry the waitress took them back to the kitchen  returned with  more well done burgers what the heck when we told her  showed her she apologized  took  off the bill we didnt have time for round  they didnt even send a manager over  for an inedible meal we will not be back id recommend trying somewhere else
