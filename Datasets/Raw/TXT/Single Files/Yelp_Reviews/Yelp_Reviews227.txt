umi is alright  what i mean by this is that the food is high quality and the service is high quality but for some reason im never completely satisfied when i leave  lets start with the good  they have great quality sushi  they have interesting taste combinations  the decor is fun especially if you sit in the traditional seating area where you dont actually sit on the floor if you can ever manage to get in and out of this seating in a graceful manner kudos to you    but the portions are small and every time weve eaten here we come away with the sense of great meal but holy moly  dunno if it was xxx good  well continue to come but probably only if someone else is paying  in the meantime its off to tamari we go
