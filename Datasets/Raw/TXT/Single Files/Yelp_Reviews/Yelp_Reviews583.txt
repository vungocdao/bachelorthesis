this review is strictly based on the sun prairie location and is only a review on the service received not the food i have had papa murphys pizza at other locations and the pizza was good unfortunately at this location i wasnt given a chance to get a pizza i walked into the store at  minutes to pm pm is when they close not only did my phone my car and my watch indicate that it was before pm but the actual clock inside the store was showing  i soon as i walked into the restaurant i was told that they were closed even though there was another customer in the store getting a pizza as well you dont even bake the pizza how much effort would it have been to take one more order and make one more pizza the total transaction could have been done and it still probably wouldnt have been  its not like the store had already been cleaned and it would have been a hassle to reopen everything i would have been completely understanding of that there are a lot of pizza options in sun prairie go there
