ive heard all the hype and wanted to try it  tonight was my second attempt here   first time new girl on the grill apologized to me at  minutes at  i walked  not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff   tonight the waiter seemed mad that i didnt know what i wanted to order  after i explained that id never been there he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for  minutes  i walked again  no more tries here  maybe im doing something wrong  haha
