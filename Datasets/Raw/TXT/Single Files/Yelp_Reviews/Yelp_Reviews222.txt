ick  stay away unless you want to be treated like you are a criminal who cannot afford a pricey item  i wanted to try on a  furand the guy said it was very expensive and would hand carry it to the front mirror for me  he then advised me to take off my vest and waited for me to do so  he would not let me handle the coat myself because it was very expensive  he watched me while i tried it on and then immediately took it off me  i wanted to tell him that  wasnt pricey for a winter coat and that i could easily afford it but decided to walk out without purchasing it  i wont be back
