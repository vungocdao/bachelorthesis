i really want to love this place but i cant the fries are great the servers attractive and the food gets there fast but the entrees arent that great bottle beer is  that much for a miller lite at a sports bar really and the servers for whatever stupid dumbass reason refuse to split checks  this does nothing but piss me off ive never understood this practice first of all youre a sports bar people genuinely come into sports bars in groups we all ordered food we all ordered drinks and it took nearly  minutes to figure out our goddamn bill at the end  attention restaurant owners most of us dont carry cash anymore get with it and start splitting checks or train your servers to do that with large groups there is no reason to make things more difficult for customers and servers will get better tips
