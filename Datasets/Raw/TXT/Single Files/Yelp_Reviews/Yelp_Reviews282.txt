stay away from this aamco they have the worst customer service ever  we purchased a groupon to have our tires rotated and a fuel injection service performed made an appointment and showed up  minutes early only to be informed that they were an hour behind i even called before i went there to see if maybe there was a cancellation so maybe i cold get in and out earlier the person who answered the phone tasha didnt say anything about them being behind had she said so i would have waited  minutes before going there turns out i sat there for almost  hours not good then when it was time for me to check out she tried to charge me   for shop materials well i happen to have worked in a shop and a couple of shop towels doesnt cost  so i picked up my car keys and left next i will be contacting groupon about this shady business
