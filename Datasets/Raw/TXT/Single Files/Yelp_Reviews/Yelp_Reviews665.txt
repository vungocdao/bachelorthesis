pizza in the cu seems to be an overall disappointment we like papa dels but it is pricey and takes forever to deliver and although we like jupiters and timpones for a good thin crust they are more involved than a simple good delivery or quick bite  stepping into that gap my wife and i find papa murhpys convenient and tasty their veggie delite is great what i like about the pizza is that the toppings are good particularly the ample fresh veggies   one of their pizzas has a garlic sauce that we also like  maybe its just me but these pizzas seem much less oily and overall slightly healthier than what we get when we order out and of course in baking ourselves get second to none freshness  so weve had great experiences here and really enjoyed the flavors and also feel that weve ate slightly healthier and saved some money it also doesnt hurt that were a mile away and we can grab one on a trip to schnucks
