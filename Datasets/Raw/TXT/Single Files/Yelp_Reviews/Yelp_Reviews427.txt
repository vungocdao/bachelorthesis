since i travel almost exclusively with us airways clt their main hub is a frequent stop and ive been flying inout of there for roughly  years now  planes usually run smoothly here no matter what section of the airport im flying out of  ive gone both domestic and international without a hassle  if you have status with us airways the fast track on the security line is a god send  the restaurants are good with some lively bars  the airport itself has a very open feel to it littered with comfortable rocking chairs should you ever want to sit a spell  shoppings decent if youre into that sort of thing  it could do with more electrical outlets for the business travelers but otherwise its a solid place
