while i am not much on chain restaurants rock bottom is certainly a place we will be visting again    my boyfriend and dining partner in crime is a huge beer lover  rock bottom offered a great variety that he was pleased with and the brewery atmosphere is really cool  the spirit and wine offerings were also pretty good with a solid variety of wines and the usual spirits with some fun cocktail options  the menu is huge and offers enough to please anyone  our server was extremely sweet quick and very knowledgeable of the menu  she passed the test when she offered solid beer recommendations with food pairings  the food was surprisingly good  we tried the southwest eggrolls to start holy carbs and cheese and then split a salad with flat bread pizza  once we finished dinner we moved to the barwhich i made a note on to visit for game days  spectacular set up with plenty of seating    the gem of this place is actually the bartenders  im sure that its no surprise that if one sits at a bar they are most likely going to chat with the bartenders  these girls were hilarious and carried on great conversation with us without seeming imposing  which is the key to a great bartender  we were enjoying the atmosphere so much we moved our evening plans to rock bottom and had friends meet us there    good food great service great drinkswe will definitely be back
