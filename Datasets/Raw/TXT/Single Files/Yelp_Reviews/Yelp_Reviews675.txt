when i went in it smelled overpoweringly like barf remembrance of the stomach bile stink still haunts me whenever i think of or pass by this eyesore it was so strong i couldnt talk listen or even think i could hardly choke down the swill and nod to whatever crap music was playing or in rough acknowledgment of what i thought someone else was saying what did she say this play duckling bucks its pretty loud   needless to say it was also too crowded dark and dirty i realize that i am not exactly in their target market being over  and all but this place is just horrifically bad those that characterize this bar as anything but an unmitigated crapdungeon are either lying to themselves or have never been to a decent bar
