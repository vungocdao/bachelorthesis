this was bar food heaven looks like a regular neighborhood bar on the outside and inside we stopped by around  and there was about a  minute wait for a table the places looks like it only fits about  people max   waiting for a table we sat at the bar and i noticed they had a great beer selection on tap and im not talking anhueser busch bs lots of craft beers and a good amount of local brews i tried a few high abv brews that were really good and put my head in another world i had been in town for about  hours by this time im really liking charlotte for dinner i tried something called what it is its a cajun pasta dish being cajun i was hesitant to try cajun food so far away from the deep south but they came though i considered licking the plate i was actually sopping up the sauce with bread like i usually only do at home i was thoroughly impressed
