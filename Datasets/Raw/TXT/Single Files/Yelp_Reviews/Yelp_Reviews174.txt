pittsburgh isnt a city known for its culinary prowess but there are little gems around town that i can always find myself going back to its not about amazing food its not about cheap food its about good value and thats what trams is their spring rolls might not be something to write home about but the coconut vermicelli is great and something you are seldom to find elsewhere in fact i havent ever had that anywhere else in my american dining experiences vietnamese coffee is like intense dessert here and a nice sugarycaffeinated pick me up thats not unwelcomed go to trams get some noodles nat
