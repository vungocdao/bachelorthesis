yesterday we stop in for a late lunch we decide to split a couple appetizers while we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa the chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too then our food came we ordered loaded nachos  which were far from loaded i am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate the second plate was the mini chimis oh my gosh they were even worse soggy covered in sour cream and what i think was guacamole  they were inedible yuck i wouldnt recommend this place to anyone no no no
