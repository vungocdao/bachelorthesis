this is probably one of the worst olive garden i have been to i am a frequent diner at olive garden but had my first experience with this particular one last week my server was horrific being a previous server myself i can understand the pressures and stress on a busy night however this server was completely inattentive and was rushing my friend and i the entire time our salads came not even five minutes before our food was sent out i am completely disappointed i dont recommend this location to anyone
