lets face it its a wendys  you know what the menu is and what to expect  really all you can review is the service which is pretty bad here    my order has been consistently wrong here  when i get a salad or a sandwich with lettuce the lettuce is not fresh  the service is rather poor  specifically it takes noticeably longer to get food at this location and often the staff arent making sure they are making food to order    additionally and this may seem like a strange note the line rails leading up to order in the restaurant are not set like every other wendys  it doesnt use the space well and its not clear where to stand   my office very close to this location yet i go out of my way to the wendys at  boyer street instead  they have much better service
