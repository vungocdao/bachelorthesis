used hotwire to find a last minute deal when traveling through madison we generally aim more for country inn or hampton but this was the best deal  at checkin i was told they only had king beds left  though the parking lot was quite empty  when we got to the room there were no sheets for the hideabed we went to the front desk and asked for some we were told that the security guard would bring them up  minutes later it was close to  am at this point we had to call and remind them   the room was pretty rough lots of ding marks on the doors and trims the light over the mirror didnt work things were just worn out  the bed had clearly seen better days  crowne gives you these silly relax packs with aroma therapy stuff  a good bed would do more for making me relaxed   in general i wasnt impressed  well stick with country inn  hampton inns
