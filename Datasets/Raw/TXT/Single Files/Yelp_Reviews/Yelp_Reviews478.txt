we went on a saturday morning and had to wait almost an hour to be seated  my egg white omelette was runny so i sent it back  we are now an hour and twenty minutes into our dining experience and i still have no food that is edible  when the omelette returned they had done something to the eggs to make them ultrafluffy which sounds like it would be good but it wasnt  it was literally like eating a kitchen sponge  my son and husband got pancakes and said that the ones we make at home are better  oh i should add that we went to the one by the target near uptown
