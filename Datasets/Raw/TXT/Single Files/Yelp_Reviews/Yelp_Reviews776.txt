i really wanted to like this place i live nearby and i love the downtown area i want all the places here to be  star joints but my partner and i showed up on a sunday afternoon with only a halfdozen people in the place and just as many waitresses and they still took  minutes to deliver our food we watched our waitress eat her lunch at the bar and then when our food came it wasnt right  we ordered a sandwich that was piled high with turkey one bite however and we knew our bread was more than dayold i actually had to ask them if it was toasted it wasnt because it was just as hard and dry as a piece of toasted bread back it went  the pizza which i ordered because of the kalamata olives their mediteranean was missing kalamata olives thats right  its the major ingredient on the pie and the joker in the kitchen forgot to put them on   never mind after  minutes youll eat anything beer was overpriced at  for a glass we got out of there as quickly as we could after the food was consumed wont be back
