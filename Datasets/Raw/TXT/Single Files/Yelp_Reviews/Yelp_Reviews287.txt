i love al mikes the restaurant is hidden in the beautiful first ward neighborhood theyve got great food a good beer list and a very chill atmosphere i typically get the blue cheese burger while my boyfriend loves to get the london broil sandwich or the pita chicken wrap with honey mustard the fries and onion rings are delicious too plus its nonsmoking which i love i just wish it stayed open later
