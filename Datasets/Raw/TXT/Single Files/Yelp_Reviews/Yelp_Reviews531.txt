great way to spend the th  been awhile since ive been to outback and they have revamped the menu a bit  slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings also at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well  my wife had here favortie alice springs chicken  normally i would go with a beef entree but opted for a new offering of parmesan herb crusted chicken with a side of mixed vegetable  only negative was the bread they served it was a very dark bread that looked with an eastern european bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor  fortunately that was the only downside  my parmesan herb crusted chicken was great  the flavors and textures complimented themselves well  my wife was also happy with her alice springs chicken which again is her normal order at outback  service was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign  atmosphere  what can i say  typical outback  if youre in the carolina place mall area this is a nice spot for dinner and now lunch
