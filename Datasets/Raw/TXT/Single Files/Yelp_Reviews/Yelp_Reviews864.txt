colin m did a masterful job filling you in on the facts about this business so check out his review  i can only second what he said    this is a real camera shop stocked to the gills with lots of topoftheline stuff  it would be easy to be intimidated but dont let that keep you from going into this fine establishment  i have bought a few things here and they have always been very helpful and friendly  you can find better prices on the internet but no instant gratification on the internet  and who is going to help you with a problem or answer a question when you have one  who will repair or clean your camera for you  no we need to support our local shops and if it means paying a few percentage points more its worth it
