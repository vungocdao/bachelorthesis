in  reviews no one has given this place below  stars  that should tell you all you need to know  consistently good bar food in a quiet publike environment service is always consistent too  nothing fancy  but thats perfect for me  go for the london broil sammy at lunch  reasonably priced and delicious  if i had a magic wand and could change a few things about this restaurant id focus on parking and adding more tables  street parking in a quiet neighborhood can be limited  ive been here a handful of times when there has been a line out the door with people waiting for a table  both faults however are incredibly hard to control
