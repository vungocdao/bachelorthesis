this hooters is near my house so its always convienient to come here but the service and the food is hit or miss  i frequent a lot and really enjoy their wings the server was mia all night twice i had ordered wings one flavorhoney thai and i got the new flavor they have chipotle honey both times was not satisfied at all server took my drink for refill and never came back after  minutes i asked for the check she sure was quick to come get that  the manager there is rude and unattentive she accused my friend of making a coupon that was on their website and did not want to accept it because she said she didnt know where the coupon came from even though we pulled up the website and showed her the coupon   the one that i really enjoy is the one on alma school it is a bit of a drive but the food and service is always spot on
