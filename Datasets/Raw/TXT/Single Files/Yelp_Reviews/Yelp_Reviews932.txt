the phx zoo is a great place to take your kids to look at large charismatic megafauna  however if you are like me you go to the zoo to try and learn something about the natural history and ecology of the animals on display  there is very little of this the farthest that the signage goes is to tell you the continent and maybe if you are lucky the country where the animal lives the zoo is also mammal heavy dont get me wrong i love a good mammal display but i also like to see a nice collection of amphibians and reptiles  if that is what you like to see the phx zoo is not the place for you  they do have a small collection of southwestern rattlesnake and some common pet amphibians but that is it for the herps  they also have a komodo dragon that is pretty large but overall they lack the fish amphibians and reptiles  also where is the insect collections maybe i missed it  the animals do have very large enclosures but some look under kept  also there is one aviary that is very cool and has some very pretty bird species  they have red eared sliders hanging out in the ponds on the grounds that are probably the reason sliders are in natural waterways now  a shame  overall i was pretty disappointed in the phx zoo the admission was pricey and the breadth of animals small
