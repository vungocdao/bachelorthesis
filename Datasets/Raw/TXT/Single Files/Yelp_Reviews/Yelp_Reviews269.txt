worst service in the area by far   once we were seated it took the waitress  minutes to make her way to our table to take our drink order  we finally decided to settle up  minutes after placing our order   the food never made it to our table   i have eaten at this restaurant before and  the service wasnt so bad   the food is generally pretty good  if you want to order chicken definitely get it shredded
