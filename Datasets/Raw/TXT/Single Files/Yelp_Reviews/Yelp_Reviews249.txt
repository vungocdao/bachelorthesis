i like chinese food  americanized or authentic from the streets of wuhan or a plaza in monroeville i have enjoyed it  in light of that china palace on walnut street is well kind of okay  the positives   the vegetarian menu has an especially good selection  im not a vegetarian but i usually order from that menu just because its something different  the food isnt terrible either but its not great  its also usually easy to get a table last time i went there i tried to go to pamelas first but it was a saturday afternoon so there was no hope of getting in  oh and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all  the negatives  dim lighting that makes me want to sleep  its not romantic just dim  the only waitress ive had there is pretty rude  shes just not cut out for waiting tables or interacting with people in general  my minimum tip is  even at the cheapest places  she got  because she didnt do the minimum amount of customer service i require to give my minimum tip  the food is only okay    all in all if youre on walnut and you can avoid china palace try something else  you wont hate your experience here but it wont be memorable either  i will probably return though for the cheap lunch specials but thats because im moving out of country soon and i need to save every penny i can not because i really love the place
