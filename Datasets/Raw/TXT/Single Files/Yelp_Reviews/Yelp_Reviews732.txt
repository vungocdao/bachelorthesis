radio maria is trying a little too hard to be trendy duecorwiseits the kind of place you walk into and expect to be treated with a bit of a condescending attitude by the staff but thankfully this was not the case we made our way to the bar where we were greeted by a friendly barman who presented us with a very nice cocktail list while we waited for a table i chose the dark and stormy which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it i ended up having another that i really didnt need just because it was so refreshingly awesome unfortunately radio marias website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that i went here on a trip out to des moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average id definitely return here on a trip to the twin city area
