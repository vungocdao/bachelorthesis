i want to like fate but i just dont they cater to my vegan cravings so how bad can it be but i just get a really shitty vibe when i walk in like its sooo annoying that i want to eat there this could all be in my head i think everyone should try it for themselves   that said whats not in my head is the pricing structure of their drinks next door holy mother of chicken christmas and rice those are some pricey fuckin drinks the ambiance is cool but it doesnt justify it not to this wretched skanks soul
