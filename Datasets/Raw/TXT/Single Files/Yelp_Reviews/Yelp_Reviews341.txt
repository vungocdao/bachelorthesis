cool restaurant  i went here on a monday afternoon with the wife dad and grandpa while paying a little visit to charlotte  my dad and grandpa live in charlotte and told us we had to try merts  cornbread was excellent  we all got our own little loaf as a starter  entrees come with two sides and i got the pulled pork as the main dish and okra and green beans  the pulled pork was a little stringy and very vinegary but unique    wife got the salmon cakes and i didnt really care for them  i told her she shouldnt have ordered that but oh well  her mac and cheese was great though  my grandpa ordered the fried chicken and it looked great and he really enjoyed it  i tried a few bites and it was very moist and crispy  i dont remember what my dad ordered  i like how they have tons of cool side dishes here and theyre all soul foodtype items  we have tons of good restaurants in southern california but nothing like merts  if i came back id probably order the fried chicken or the catfish if im feeling exotic  they probably have about  or so sides  a good mixture of carbs and veggies  i wish i tried the fried green tomatoes  well ill be back someday to try something different  im glad my dad and grandpa took us here
