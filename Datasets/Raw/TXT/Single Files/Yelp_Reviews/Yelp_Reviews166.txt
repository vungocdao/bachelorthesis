i dont care for the lunch buffet because of its limited options mostly potatoes and beans for vegetarians sometimes some previously frozen veggie medleys and lack of spice for understandable reasons but for dinner especially take out i give peoples  stars   i usually get either baingan bartha or aloo gobi as well as a dal and a plain naan the dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two ive tried to stop letting that perplex me but i can never remember the one they dont have and often try to order it maybe my take out menu is outdated in that i should cross that one out ok now on to important stuffi order a spice level of  out of  the results are dynamite instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil i can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice they also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes each bite is a mouth explosion and i love mouth explosions   this restaurant has its shortcomings but since its the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure i am a big fan
