we went on a friday night as packed as it looked we actually went right in and got a table the waitress was good and always on point with service   as for the food i ordered the jack daniels ribs and shrimp the shrimp were really good as for the ribs they showed you shouldnt order ribs unless its a bbq place they were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water my wife ordered the steak sadly a majority of that oz consisted of nothing but fat   to top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass they were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldnt hear your own self think i dont mind people being loud but cmon you dont go to a restaurant and get blitzed but from the way it seemed the manager and servers acted like its an everyday thing so what do i know i was just eating there   eating there made me realize why i never actually go eat there nor do i really plan on going anytime soon
