gross what happened it has been a while since i have been to pf changs it used to be one of my favoritesi remember going to a conference and i ate at the pf changs across the street from my hotel every day   this last time there was pure disappointment from the quality of the food to the service to the taste it was as if i was at some cheap fast food joint each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base it was way too salty since when did they start rationing out their rice we got a very tiny portion of rice and we had to keep asking for more to soak up the salty sauce on the dish blah the service was super slow to greet us at the table and to bring us what we needed made for a very unenjoyable experience   blahand im sad that it wasnt better
