happened upon this restaurant while staying at a nearby hotel we drove by earlier in the day and were first interested in the unique architecture of the building the decor inside was fun and had an oldschool feel lots of pink and green neon lights mirrors and wall murals i loved it  went in for dinner a little late still being on west coastvacation time but there were still quite a few people and we werent rushed at all our server was very friendly and helpful when we asked about the menu even though she needed to check with the kitchen on some of our particular needs   we started with two margaritas and the espinaca con queso unfortunately it was missing spinach hmm there were some green chiles however that added to the cheese dip i ordered a beef chimichanga with their famous baja sauce oh how i love this white creamy spicy sauce maybe a spicy sour cream it was delicious hubby got steak fajitas which were good but believe it or not i was hooked on the grilled onions they were so flavorful im glad there were a lot on his platter so i could steal more than a few
