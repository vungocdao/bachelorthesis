for all the hype michaels is quite a disappointment   maybe its because i didnt try the custard but seriously i didnt need more weighing down in this weatherso i ordered an orange crush float instead for something that would have cost me maybe cents to make at home i paid close to  for a oz cup that is ridiculous in general i think their prices are pretty steep for what you getyoud probably have to order a burger to really get a bang for your buck  like rb i also had an issue with the service it was slow disorganized and not very friendly the line was almost out the door but the employees behind the counter didnt even attempt to speed up the service one of them just disappeared into a back room tsktsk i also thought it was hilarious how one of the employees crumpled up an order form before the order had been completed and then had to uncrumple the paper so she could reread the order to her coworker really   anyway i will probably give the monroe st michaels  and their custardsburgers  a shot but im not going to get my hopes up
