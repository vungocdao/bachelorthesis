this is my new favorite ht its almost always crowded but its worth it  the selection is better than most hts and the prices are even better how the price can be different one ht  miles away from another ht is beyond me but ive definitely noticed   other differences are that this location seems to be better lit than some of the others and everything looks bright and clean who doesnt love shiny  the ht in matthews has a better local produce selection but higher prices on everything else  you cant win them all i suppose
