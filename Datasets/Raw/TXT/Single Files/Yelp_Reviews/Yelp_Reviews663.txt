ok this place has decent food  well depending on the day  sometimes its good sometimes its not  however for a small mom and pop place they dont seem to do much to make people feel welcome    the last time i ate there was the last time  i had breakfast with a friend of mine and all was going well weak coffee aside  we ordered some breakfast and the waitress who turned out to be one of the managers or supervisors asked if we wanted gravy on our potatoes  my friend said id love it on the side please only to be told no  when he said no she replied gravy is complimentary and you either have it on the potatoes or no gravy  i made the choice then that if one bowl for gravy was too precious to wash then i would save them the time and effort by not going back  problem solved all dishes are clean  skip it and go to sams cafe
