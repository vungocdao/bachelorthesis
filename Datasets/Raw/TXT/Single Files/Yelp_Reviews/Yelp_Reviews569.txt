ate there last night with a group of friends  the waitstaff was friendly but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night  i hate french onion soup that was so salty it tasted like a salt lick  plus they put so many croutons in the soup i was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up  i ordered the bluegill for my main dish  being an avid fisherman i can appreciate some good wisconsin bluegill  this bluegill however was not good  it was cold and tasted very old  the fries that went along with it were also extremely salty  a couple people in the group said their food was okay but definitely not worth a trip back  i was quite bummed about this
