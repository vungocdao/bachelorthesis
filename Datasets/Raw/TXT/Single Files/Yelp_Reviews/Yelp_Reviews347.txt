such amazing soul food seriously some of the best collard greens ever its a shame that such awesome food can be disappointed by such horrible service we waited for over an hour for an omelette and a vegetable plate the waitress could have cared less that we had to wait our drinks stayed empty for most of the meal and it took  minutes and repeated requests for a small packet of mustard we are from out of town and had heard such amazing things about this place once again great food but super horrible service not sure due to the service that we will return the next time we are in charlotte
