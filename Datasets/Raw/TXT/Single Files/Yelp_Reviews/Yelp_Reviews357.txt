what the hell phils tavern every time i come here usually before a show things just dont work out i wanted them to but they just didnt  food the only food ive tried here were the jalapano poppers and then i never tried anything here again how do you burn something in a deep fryer normally id just be impressed but i was hungry   drinks their drink specials are nothing to write home about the dirty martini was weak and the tiny shrivelled spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress at least it was only  unfortunately the corona of the person i was with only cost fifty cents less than that  for a warm corona do not want  service nice but few and far between  atmosphere dank dirty sticky these are only a few of the descriptors for this place i fear the day where i will have no choice but to use the facilities here  overall  dont waste your time and money i hear theres better places in this area i just need to find them
