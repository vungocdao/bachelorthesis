we went here for lunch last week the place is very small cramped they only have like  little tables that seat two people and one that sits four the place was completely packed as it was lunch hour in the galleria area service was slow and kinda confusing  they were out of several items specifically cilantro which was one of the main ingredients in beckys sub the problem wasnt that they were out but that they failed to tell her this until the sub was in midproduction  mine was fine as far as production and taste but for a toasted sub it was barely warm  not that this is their fault as they only serve it but stay away from the honey lemonade they have its disgusting  the place was fairly clean and well stocked and organized the staff were friendly the two main sandwich guys spoke very little english so i had to repeat my order a couple of times to confused looks to boot they sandwich guys spoke different languages from each other so you can tell there was some confusion and even a little bickering back and forth not major but noticeable  not awful but they can improve
