it seems like every other time i take my pets to point breeze there is an unnecessary frustration   from being berating for using their online prescription program to being misquoted prices substantially to poor customer service i just keep hoping each time will be better  although i know they love animals i suspect they love money more  dr caroline simard is an excellent vet but my last two visits have been pushed to other vets whose bedside manner is atrocious   im a  yearold  who has been taking my pets to vets since childhood and i dont understand why each visit leaves a sour taste in my mouth
