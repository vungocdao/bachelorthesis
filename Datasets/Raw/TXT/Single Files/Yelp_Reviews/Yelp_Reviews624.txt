maybe the most disorganized store i have ever seen now add that in with trying to bring my dog with me into this storepure chaos   my last visit of many ive made to this petsmart made me realize that im better off heading to either fleet farm or tabby and jacks to get whatever i may be looking at locally for my dog    i enjoy the fact i can walk my dog into the store to get what i need but when i head to the footwear isle to find nothing for medium to large dog sizes i get a little irritated  do the employees working here know how to stock the shelves why are all the socks and footwear thrown all over the bottom shelf of the clothing isle   not everyone has a  lb dog im not even asking much i have a  lb english bulldog and i still could not find anything in his size   the last thing i want to do is sift through items thrown all over the floor and shelf forget it   i asked a employee if they carried socks for medium to large size dogs  their website says this store does have these items in stock and instead of even helping me sift through their ridiculous isle i was told what you see if what we have  come on man really is this your best customer service  not sure if you will be seeing much more of me and my bully anytime soon coming back in here
