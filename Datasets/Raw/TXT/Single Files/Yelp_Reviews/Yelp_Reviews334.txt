knowing my love for salsaritas on rea road a coworker and i decided to head there for lunch we arrived shortly after  and like others have mentioned the line was out the entryway  however even though the line was long it moves smoothly and didnt take too long  salsaritas has a rhytmn that seems to work like an assembly line i ordered the two taco combo with chips and queso and a side of salsa  i chose two soft tacos which are steamed and topped with a meat of which i chose chicken and pulled pork onto the toppings lettuce jalepeno sour cream guacamole and cheese to complete my order  the chicken just like the other location was great and the pulled pork was awesome i wil definitely try that again  the chips were fresh some with a little extra seasoning that i love  the queso was a little cold but overall good  a definite great spot for lunch but may need to think about getting there a few minutes before  just to get ahead the large crowd
