wownever thought there is a difference between dive bars and found out there is a big difference  this place should be categorize as a shit bar instead of a dive bar   called about  and ask about employment there and was told by some bitch working there said no we are not hiring and then with her stupid uneducated trailer trash bitch attitude ass added if you are in the business  you should know not to call during lunch   its  past lunch time rush and this bitch had to open her probably fat pimple faced mouth and give this rude comment this was so uncalled for  so i went in this shitty place to complain so glad i did not applied at this nasty ass placewhich i did not understand why anybody else did not smell or see how nasty this place really is and asked for the manager this  nasty toothless so calledwaitress said he was bartending and was busy i still spoke to this piece of shit is way too much nice of a word for this assholemanager and was treated again like a piece shit and he bitched me out saying if you are not a customer i dont have time for your shit and come back later   well the only time i would come back to this shitty bar if i ever wanted a staff infection or hepatitis from the gross bathrooms   how can anybody eat at a place where the management treats anyone this way  i would never eat here and wouldnt anyone else eat at this place
