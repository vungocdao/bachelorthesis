this is by far the best soft serve ice cream place in southwestern pa the flavor of the week is always interestingand tasty though i am somewhat disappointed that theyve switched to a lower grade ice milk for their vanilla and chocolate offerings i dont know if this is a matter of cutting corners or if the better stuff simply isnt available any longer either way this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of dq tastee freeze etc its definitely worth the trip its mostly street parking though they do have about  parking spaces off to the side serving sizes are huge the small cone here is the same size as a dq large and the large is so big they cant fit it through the windowthey hand it out the side door  if you want a real kodak momentorder a large cone for the kids and keep the camera and wet wipes handy
