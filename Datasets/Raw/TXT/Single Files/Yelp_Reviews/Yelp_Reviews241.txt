beware the loudmouthed lout working the front we stopped by a couple nights ago and asked to check the menu finding it acceptable  despite an abundance of starch with minimal protein  we walked away to go find the other members of our party to return and ask for a table but we were accosted by a boorish old man who kept yelling hey until we turned around to see what he wanted come to find out he wanted to insult us by telling us to check out the hamburgers across the street if we didnt want or couldnt afford his fare well needless to say we didnt go back and had a fine dinner elsewhere tip to the house insulting the public is no way to win friends or customers
