a very odd experience    we entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess  we told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what i thought was the bar area well yes but she took us out the back door of the restaurant to the back door of the bar  once there i started to get nervous  a line of  or  people waiting to get in met by two security people checking identification    once you show the security people your id they then put a wrist band on you  i am pushing  but perhaps without the wrist band someone may mistake me for under     finally inside it was a throw back to some s nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more at attention security staff    they feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted mexican food which was actually fresh and tasty  our server was nice and attentive    the entire time we were there i was worried to why they needed a security team roaming about
