i went for a saturday afternoon world cup game for third place between germany and uruguay  most tables in front of the screen were taken but not packed so it wasnt too noisy  service was really slow but the waitress was authentic  not the best review since i ordered a salad at a pub but the salad was good  fresh  i tried the sweet potato fries too  the fries were a little soggy but will go back under different circumstances to try them out since the beer selection is extensive and within walking distance
