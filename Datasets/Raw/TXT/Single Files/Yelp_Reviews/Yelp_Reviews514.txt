i have to say this eastern carolina bbq is some of the best i have had since when i was a child living in greenville nc my granddaddy use to take us to his favorite bbq place just across the tar river near the airport almost every sunday for dinner living in florida i dont get this type of q down there so when i am in charlotte i make it a point to eat here twice now and counting
