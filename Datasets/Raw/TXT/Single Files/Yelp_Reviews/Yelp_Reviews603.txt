i came through this dive while pubcrawling amongst friends as we lined up at the bar to order beers and grub  the bartenders muttering under her breath oh shit should have tipped us off to the piss poor service that awaited us apparently theyre not accustomed to seeing a group of  people waltz in this dump go fig mind you we were very accommodating and considerate of the surprise rush we created however when they served our table separately and completely forgot my food i was forced to demand a refund theyre lucky i wasnt a complete ahole and demanded the portion of the tip that i already paid toward my food order  sure if youre looking for a very lonely dive all to yourself and a few friends this might be your place but for us it was a complete and utter disaster  oh did i mention the incessant flies throughout the establishment yeah not cool
