a phoenix native told me i had to try the mexican food while i was in town so i stopped by la tolteca and i was happy i did  i tired out a torta and a couple of sopas  the al pastor sopa was right on as was the the carne asada  my milanesa torta was a bit chewy but otherwise prepared with great fresh veggies  hit up the salsa bar for some extra flavor  enjoy
