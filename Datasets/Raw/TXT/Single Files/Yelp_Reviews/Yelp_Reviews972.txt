love the food quality and cleanliness the staff jimmy and austin were both friendly and helpful and customer oriented the few times ive been in though the female servers were standing around chatting about their personal things loudly and not tending to tables as quickly as they should that is what kept me from giving a five star otherwise awesome place to eat
