first time here  ill give credit where its due they have apparently been reading the reviews because the staff made an extra effort to be friendly and courteous   i had  bbq beef sandwiches because they were out of the pulled pork  while eating my sandwiches i had the thought there should be laws enacted to constitute what restaurants can call bbq  boiled meat covered in bbq sauce is not bbq   i grew up in the south ive been to memphis in may a couple of times so my standards for bbq are admittedly higher than average but this was not even close to real bbq  was it decent food  sure  decent at best  was it the reason i got an upset stomach a couple hours later possibly   i dont care about the old decor dirty looking bathrooms or anything else if the food was good i would go back  it wasnt
