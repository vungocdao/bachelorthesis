theres a reason i avoid bagel sandwiches but i thought id give it another try i ordered the thai chicken sandwich which consists of a plain bagel smeared with cream cheese lettuce cucumber and a  chicken breast and it comes with a cup of thai peanut sauce tasty indeed however what a large mess this made as we all know bagels arent the easiest breads to bite smear on cream cheese add slick things like lettuce and cucumber and now you have a very messy meal the cream cheese is of sort of like grease on a bush hog  everything wants to squirt out no showers are in bathroom which is too bad as i needed one after eating my sandwich with this said the staff was very nice i just need to avoid bagel sandwiches
