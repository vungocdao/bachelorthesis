i am not a vegan and went there to meet friends and enjoy the atmosphere i must say the hipster tude of the place was intimidating at first but its super friendly and retrofeeling  servers were fairly friendly  we had some great lattes and chai teas and chatted for a long time without being bothered  didnt try the food but there were lots of vegeterian and vegan options
