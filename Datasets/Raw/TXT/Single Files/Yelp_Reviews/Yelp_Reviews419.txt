i wasnt quite sure what to expect from this place  seeing some of the patrons walking into this place dressed up and at the same time seeing a giant alligator statue sitting in a throne in the front yard  once inside its actually a really nice place  the service is great the waitresses are very friendly and attentive and really cared that we had a good time  there is live music on some nights which always makes for a good time  looking at the other reviews i think the food is kind of hit or miss  i guess i was lucky with the red beans and rice it was really good by my standards at least
