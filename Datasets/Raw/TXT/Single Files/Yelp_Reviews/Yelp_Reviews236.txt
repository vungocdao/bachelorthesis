first giant eagle is convenient it open early and closes late on a daily basis i have yet to find another store that sells the same variation of food in a unitary complex and despite its size the supermarket is clean and the employees are knowledgeable on the status and location of most items  second the prices for nonproduce items are competitive if not better than nearby competing stores the produce items tend to be more expensive but to be fair nearly all if it is fresh  third giant eagle offers a brand guarantee and a return policy which assure customer satisfactio
