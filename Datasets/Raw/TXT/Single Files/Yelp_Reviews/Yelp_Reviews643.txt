we recently bought a midcentury house and had no furniture for a couple of the rooms we went to the rubins clearance center and happened to catch their moving sale which meant that everything was marked down below their normal clearance price nice you wont pay ikea prices but this is for the most part highquality stuff real leather real wood for most items etc there are a few with scratches and dents and many items are floor models but for the most part that doesnt bother me we got a really good deal on a chair that apparently someone had ordered but came with the wrong fabric we also left with a shelfstorage unitdrawer thing a desk and a rolling chair the manager threw in a few gifty items i had picked out too   the downside is the salesperson not the manager kept reminding us that it was  minutes until closing time this started a half hour before believe me i used to work in retail and i know the oh you have a half hour before we close trick we were out of there ten minutes before they closed so its not like we were making them stay late if youre making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars it ended up under k but still you shouldnt be pushing people out the door i might have picked up a couple of other items if i hadnt felt rushed out
