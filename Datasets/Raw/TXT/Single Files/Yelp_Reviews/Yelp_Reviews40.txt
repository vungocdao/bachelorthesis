my girlfriend and i went to casbah for the first time recently and we both enjoyed our experience  the atmosphere is dressy but the restaurant isnt so formal that it feels stuffy or uncomfortable which is a welcome change compared to most classy restaurants  the environment was relaxed and it was easy to have a quiet conversation throughout the meal  as for the meal itself we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up  our waiter was courteous and provided good fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering which was quite nice  for an appetizer we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique  following the cheese tray i dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia  both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious  id recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good out of the ordinary food
