in theory tessaros is exactly what you want  a casual neighborhood joint in a great location with an acclaimed product in practice its not very pleasant to go there i dont think they want us there every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward  the burger itself   the actual cooked meat  is indeed good but they have no interest in all the other stuff that turns cooked meat into a hamburger experience  the buns are poor qualit
