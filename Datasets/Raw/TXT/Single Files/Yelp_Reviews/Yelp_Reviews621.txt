i really dislike menards  for every positive interaction i have i have two negatives ones  my husband and i just bought a house so you can imagine how much time we spend here  i prefer home depot but the prices are so much lower at menards  in the matter of two weeks all of this happened   i bought a can of paint for our guest room  i wanted the best paint with the primer all the bells and whistles  i was covering purple  i needed it  the salesperson said i could pick from any four  yet he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other  it was weird  like here are your options but i can not tell you what their difference really is  and some were the same brand   when painting the ceiling of said room we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it  this paint was about six months old  nothing happened to it  so we go back to menards  we have shopped at several area menards because we are about convenience  the lady at the counter was so rude  we did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system  we pay for most things in cash and apparently this is not a good idea at menards  it had a menards sticker which this location does not use but other locations still use    every time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here  we then had to repeat again that we do not just shop at this location  we shop outside the city sometimes  we pick things up on our way home    another rep interceded and offered to return it for us  she was so nice  i wish i remembered all of their names  but she needed a person from paint to approve it  before looking at the paint a rep spoke to this rude customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back  it must be our fault and that is that  then they said they could not take and dispose of it  nice huh  no one asked us anything  the paint was brand new     the same day we went to return the paint we wanted to look at screen doors  there was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone  he was so short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions  it was ridiculous    so the prices keep us going back but the rest  awfulhellish
