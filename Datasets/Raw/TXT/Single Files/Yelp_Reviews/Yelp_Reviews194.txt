i really dont understand the hype of this place to be honest had the personal recommendations from friends not made this place seem like the biggest deal in the city then i would have probably rated it a  or  the pizza was just ok it was decently greasy and the crust wasnt all that special they wouldnt deliver even though i am literally a few blocks from them and they dont accept credit  debit card  a huge downfall for me
