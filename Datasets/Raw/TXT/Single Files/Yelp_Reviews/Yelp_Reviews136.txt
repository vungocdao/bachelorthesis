worst experience at a restaurant ever  i dont need anything fancy but this was pathetic  my coke was colored water when i sent it back she said they just changed it  came back and said we dont have coke would you like a sprite  the sprite was flat but i was afraid to order a water after that  why didnt we just leave then  the menu had quite a few spelling errors we joked about but no joke  dont go here  if i could rate this a zero i would
