i stumbled across this museum while on the way to pam with a few hours to kill before our flights my friend and i decided to stop here instead  it was a great find and i learned so much unfortunately i hadnt learned very much about native american culture or art in school but i felt like my visit to the heard made up for that a little we had an excellent tour guide who was part navajo and part hopi in addition to giving us a broad overview of native american history he also gave us many insights into growing up on a reservation and cultural traditions as we toured through the galleries filled with basketry ceramics and navajo blankets he explained that a lot of the names given to the tribes by white settlers were simply the result of the two groups not understanding one another for instance the pima tribe is so called because in response to the question what are you called the people answered pima which means i dont knowas in i dont know what you crazy people are asking me  my friend and i had a wonderful time and i would definitely recommend visiting if youre ever in phoenix
