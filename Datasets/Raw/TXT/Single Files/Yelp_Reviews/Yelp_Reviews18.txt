wow what a shame my family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine we are a very large family and love foods of all kind weve eaten chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities hands down this was the worst weve ever had cold tough congealed and tasteless  thats the only way to describe it ill never order from here again quite frankly the fact that i took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was my complaints fell on deaf ears i guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food i understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food it happens but when it does you bend over backwards to make it right not at this place i was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me i guess thats how they deflect complaints  blame it on the owners that arent there and make the customer for away angry  too bad because we will be visiting a competitor in the future this family of  wont be visiting china sea ever again oh and by the way why cant i give this place zero stars
