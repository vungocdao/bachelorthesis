common ground gets a lot of flack for being expensive but really its only expensive if youre comparing common grounds organic items to the conventional items at schnucks or meijer  and several time ive noticed common grounds organics were actually priced cheaper than those at the chain stores you also have to consider the fact that common ground is a small independent grocery store that has to have a higher margin in order to survive  and it tries its best to practice what it preaches in its business practices from biodegradable americanmade produce bags to decent employee wages all those little ethical steps cost money  and since the coop is community owned ultimately the money you spend there is going back into the community rather than in some corrupt ceos pocket and thats always a good thing  apart from my pricejustification rant this is the most awesome grocery store in town great deli with vegan options everyday and beautiful produce  often local and organic  that you cant find anywhere else
