service i asked the clerk what would be a good meal for a family of four he gave his recommendation and i went with it got the meal home and we only have  mac and cheese  potato salad  rolls now this wasnt some big styrofoam container it was just enough for one person the clerk seemed like it was a pain for him to answer some questions about the food that is keeping him employed   food it was ok not great just okay there wasnt anything that screamed have seconds the sauce is decent nothing spectacular   overall it was a  because nothing blew me away i just made some ribs tonight on the grill and i thought they were better than honeys  if youre craving bbq then this will get you out of a pinch but if you want the slap yo momma type grub then make an about face
