i recently bought my first motorcycle a  ktm duke ii and found bohns when searching online for ktm dealers i went in with the intention of buying a jacket helmet and gloves their store is pretty nice inside and they have a good selection of gear mostly dirtoriented though   i wasnt quite sure what i wanted so i asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet she was helpful and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather however a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket which they also sold and she commented that the hated that jacket and that the liner was nothing more than a glorified garbage bag ok  we also talked to a guy at the register about a  ktm  mxc that my friend just bought and asked a simple question about a clutch cable the guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless and im not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was he ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old what  even after that i still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet i liked that they had assured me would be in later that week i then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available but that i could pick another style i then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund  i wanted to like this place but between the thinlyveiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff i dont think ill ever return their prices and selection are pretty decent so if you are in the area and know what you want it might be ok to stop by and pick something up if you have any alternative though i would avoid this place
