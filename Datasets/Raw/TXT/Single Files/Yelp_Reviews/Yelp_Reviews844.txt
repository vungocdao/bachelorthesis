going in  you know your going to get typical tgif food  but the view is great  if youre a sports junky you need to eat here once  we took my grandfather a sports nut for lunch hopped off the light rail and he loved it  as we ate lunch on the patio we watched as the landscapers groomed the field  the top was open the sun was shining a breeze was blowingahhh  the service was perfect  our server was funny  took time to chat and made sure we had what we needed as soon or before we needed it
