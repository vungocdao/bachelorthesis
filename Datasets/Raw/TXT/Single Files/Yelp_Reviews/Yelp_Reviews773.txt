i stopped in one day when i first moved here and sampled a couple of things the chicken teriyaki the fried gyoza and some kind of drink nothing was fresh everything tasted like old fryer grease or freezerburn except my drink to their credit the service was immaculate the women who helped me was super friendly and made suggestions of things i should try on my next visit when pigs fly i am really amazed by the positive reviews here unfortunately this place is just a couple blocks from my house so i have to deal with the nasty stench from their deep fryer when i walk to the lightrail on my way to work
