ditto the other ratings for uverse customer service at least once you get past the fabulous sales people my install was scheduled for between  am on a saturday dude called at  to say he was the outside guy and was on his way was indignant when i asked about the earlier time frame actually i laughed when i answered the phone and found out who he was hrs late but i let him come and do at least the outside work called the number on my scheduled appt email at  got a woman who knew nothing about my issues tried to transfer me to dispatch transfer failed she called me back i asked for a supervisor and was on hold for  minutes she called back again tried to transfer me to somebody else said there was a problem with my order but she couldnt tell me what it was after another  minutes on hold i hung up she called back once more told me she would call me as soon as the department was available  never heard back unbelievable not thrilled with time warner or most of their contracted installrepair folks but at least when they are going to be late or have to reschedule they call dont do it
