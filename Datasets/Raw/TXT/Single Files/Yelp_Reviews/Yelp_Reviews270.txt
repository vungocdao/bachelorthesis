having been in charlotte only a year id despaired of finding good german cuisine in the qc  turns out you have to go to pineville  also turns out its well worth the drive  the waldhorn is a little kitschy but appropriately so  their tap selection is wellchosen and good  the rolls are pretzely and fantastic  the sauerkraut is sauer enough though they do the sweet carawayseed version  the wurst is the best in charlotte  please dont kill me  we started with the wurst plate served with mustard sauerkraut and rolls  there was plenty and i shouldve stopped there but i hadnt had good german food in a while and was in a celebratory mood  i had the jagerschnitzel  it was made entirely of food  pork was thin crispy and delicious  red cabbage was firm and sweet  spuetzle needed salt but it usually does  heated up well the next day alsothere was a lot of it  she had the venison  sweet lord  that is all  an older gentleman in liederhosen and wielding an accordion played throughout the place but never so loud as to be distracting  i like the accordion though so your mileage may vary  it is a little pricier than i wouldve liked but i dont think that is going to stop me from going back  regularly
