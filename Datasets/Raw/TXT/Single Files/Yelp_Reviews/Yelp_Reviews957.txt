terrie really made our experience i love applebees anyway but she really treated us like we were the only table she had   we walked in at pm on a sunday the place closes at midnight we were just going to get a quick bite so they could close terrie was very friendly and honest about what i should order to get a good deal i tried the wonton tacos and they were delicious we also had spinach and artichoke dip they gave us lots of chips and terrie helped us box them up with some extra salsa   next time i am in phoenix and want applebees i will go to this location simply because of the service we received
