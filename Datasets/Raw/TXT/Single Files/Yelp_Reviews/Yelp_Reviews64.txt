i had not been to betos in many many years  boy has the place grown up  still the same pizza that you will either love or hate  the pizza here has the chesse and topings put on after they cook it so it melts some while you eat it  tastes really good    i also has the apetizer sampler which was a lot of food for two people   was not to crowded but full saturday at lunch  highly recommended
