the first time i experienced the eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room as i walked through the restaurant i was surprised it was so busyi mean this is a breakfast place right   the decor is very outdated with knick knack cutter everywhere i am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants i can see why old people love this place   i ordered the taco salad for my lunch what a disappointment almost bad iceberg lettuce a sprinkling of all other toppings no beans so if you want any protein you have to pay  extra to add chicken this salad was not worth  with a  iced tea and a  added tip to the bill i got out of there for  i will pay  for a weekday lunch but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food   yesterday i went to the eggery again with nico and his grandma after church maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch same awful decor but it seemed a bit more charming at am   i had the berry blintz crepes which were pretty good stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt mixed berries cottage cheese and a little bit of cream cheese whipped cream toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes it seemed like a lot of food for  a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad   i am not in any hurry to return to the eggery although my business group meets there every week nico did point out that i have been here twice now and have yet to actually try any egg dish maybe next time
