went to harpers this past tuesday it had been at least  months or more since i had  had the bettys pimento cheeseburger sat in the bar area with one of the new interactive tables that was so cool seems like the menu is much smaller than is used to be but i did finally find my beloved burger and ordered it with fries i told the waitress to please make sure the fries were hot because the last time i was there they had been cold and i really wanted to enjoy this visit when i received the burger it looked different smaller and somehow sadder i could actually fit this burger into my mouth that used to be impossible because it was huge and i would have to eat it with a knife and fork the flavor was bland and instead of the cheese running down my fingers i could barely taste it and the meat was just bland i was so sad  so in short the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down i guess i will have to find a new fav burger jointbooooooo
