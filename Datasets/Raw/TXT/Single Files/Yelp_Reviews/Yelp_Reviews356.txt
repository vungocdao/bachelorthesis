not impressed  if there were  stars thats the rating this place would get  i ordered a cheeseburger and it was worse than what youd expect from a school lunchroom   and why is this place called an irish pub  one would expect typical irish dishes but not here  i honestly have no idea how this place stays in business  sorry hartigans i wont be going back
