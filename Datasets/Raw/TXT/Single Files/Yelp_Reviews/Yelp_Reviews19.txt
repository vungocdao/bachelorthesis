i fell in love with this place as soon as we pulled up and saw the lights strung up and  oldies coming from the speakers   i tried the banana cream pie hard ice cream their scoops are very generous   my bf got the peach cobbler hard ice cream and that was to die for we got  servings of ice cream for  which nowadays is a steal imo    ill definitely be heading back with my coworkers this week
