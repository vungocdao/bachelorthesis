there is serious separation anxiety when you have to leave your stylist with whom you have established a bond and maybe even spilled serious personal information to   having moved from the south i had to leave a woman i loved and strike out into all new territory it was the end of a  year relationship and i wasnt prepared to see just any old body after that   then i found nicolette at mcn shes amazing and chill and friendly and interesting and and and shes great at her job also the salon is beautiful and the stylists range in price so if you are occasionally living from paycheck to paycheck like me you can see jenn or kara and get a great cut without having to scrounge through your piggy bank for a little extra  however if you dont like dogs be aware that josie the bulldog is frequently around and about
