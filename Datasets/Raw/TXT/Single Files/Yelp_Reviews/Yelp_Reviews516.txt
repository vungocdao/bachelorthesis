dont waste your time overpriced low quality hibachi you can tell from the moment you walk in cardboard handwritten signs screaming no return not responsible for food issues that maybe you should turn around and leave i however made the mistake of staying i purchased the beef teriyaki combo which was rung up wrong and had to be fixed after i waited for my food for  mins the beef was over cooked and too lightly sauced the rice was bland and carrots overcooked into mush not worth the stomach ache i had the rest of the day
