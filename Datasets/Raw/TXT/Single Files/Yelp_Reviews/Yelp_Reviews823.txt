went there with my girlfriend for what i thought would be good bbq she ordered the half chicken and i got a pulled pork sandwich  not only did her chicken come out pink and bleeding once but it happened twice when i told them the first time the cashier said we usually have good food so its okay to serve bad food too he asked how the chicken was when he was bringing in the chairs from outside and we said the same  still pink and bleeding all he said was oh okay and walked away i didnt even eat my sandwich because if they couldnt cook chicken right why should i trust them to cook the pork correctly when i went to the front to talk with them they all disappeared  never would i think about going back and spend my money there again
