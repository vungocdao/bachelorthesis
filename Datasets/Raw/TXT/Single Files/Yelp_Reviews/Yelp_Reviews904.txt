under construction when i visited today but still beautiful fellow botanical gardeners were friendly   bottled water is not overpriced at  a bottle it didnt sting that i forgot to bring my own water  park rangers are stern silently watching and protecting our picanik baskets from any impending doom  wear your best as there are tons of photographers running around this could be your chance to get discovered  maybe your errant hand or part of your backpack will end up in some semifamous hipsters flickr
