stars are for the food only     rating  got there at pm on saturday night they told us it was an hour wait which was expected but it only took minutes to be seated so that was a bonus  started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me nowfyilove the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory  i had the singapore rice noodles  this was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better  the fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw   some good notes were the dynamite shrimp plump juicy tangy with a small kick    sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick   the service was annoying   we were there less than  minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there   constantly asking if he could remove my plate  i had to sternly say at one point that i will let you know when i am finished  i found it rude especially since  there wasnt even a line at this point    i think we will travel elsewhere following a movie  the result never quite met the anticipation
