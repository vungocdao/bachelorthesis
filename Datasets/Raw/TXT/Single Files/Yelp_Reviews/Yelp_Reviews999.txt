i took my phone out while walking around no photography in the store hun to which i replied that i was not i know sweetheart im just sayin theres no photography in the store honey   its hard enough being a woman that can fix her own car stuff being called pet names by strange women does not help   i contacted corporate and told them that the whole experience made me feel very uncomfortable   this is where the obviously one star review turns into a five star review the general manager was awesome in apologizing and assured me that she would receive some coaching on subtlety and proper behavior  that really makes up for it my greatest fear was that it was a given that if youre a woman in autozone youre going to encounter condescending employees i really felt like he was concerned and wanted that to not be the case  thanks for caring autozone
