beef kabob gets an easy five stars  persian hot tea five stars the eggplant dish was very good the belly dancing gets five stars  service also gets five stars  from there everything else was good though none of it was better than three stars and not as flavorful as i hoped still good  im the only dude here  eleven female patrons including my bride add two belly dancers and our waitress im out numbered  to     great show  if you have never seen live belly dancing it is usually entertaining and though maybe initially awkward it is fun  persian ice cream nice flavor combination of pistachio rose water and saffron less dense than kulfi  if i had never eaten indian kulfi i would have probably rated this ice cream higher  baklava a bit disappointing papery filo though drier than the overly syrupy version
