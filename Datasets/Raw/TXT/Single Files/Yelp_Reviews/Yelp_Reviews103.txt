i hesitate to even write this review because technically we didnt eat here  but after reading the other reviews i thought eh what the hell  we came in and were seated at pm for dessertsdrinks   by  we still hadnt seen our waitress  we decided it wasnt worth it and just left  i did eat here a month ago and yes  the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy  and then to pay around  for that  lol  right  i wont be back
