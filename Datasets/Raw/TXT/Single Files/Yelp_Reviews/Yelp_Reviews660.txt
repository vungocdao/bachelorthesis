brought my saturn to fairfield automotive and i couldnt be happier the fuel pump had a component that was cracked and they were able to repair it rather than my purchasing the entire unit which saved me the equivalent of my mortgage this month  i will definitely return and would recommend their service very personable and friendly staff and an overall great experience
