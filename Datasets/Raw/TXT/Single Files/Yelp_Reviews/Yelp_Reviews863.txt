i completely agree with chris s happy pills seriously everyone at this hospital is so nice the nurses the doctors all of the staffday and night my friend is being treated here and has been addmited for various days now and everyone agrees this hospital has really made this whole situation so much more bearable and less stressful considering   when you or a friend is going through illness or trauma the last thing you want to deal with is rude and uncaring nurses and doctors you will not experience that herethey are wonderful  the hospital itself is very nice it feels modern and clean there is even a nice healing garden you or patients can relax and get a little fresh air in the food isnt that bad considering this is a hospitali had a nice salad and sweet potato fries one day prices are like an airportexpensive but at least its not typical cafeteria food  thank you good sam for taking such good care of my friend
