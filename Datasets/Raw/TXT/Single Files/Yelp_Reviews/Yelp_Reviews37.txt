when scoping around online for a good nye dinner destination for my husband and me casbahs prix fixe menu really jumped off the page since the big burrito group is so popular i was happy to get reservations especially since a lot of times were already booked  the hubby and i arrived a few minutes early for dinner i had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that big burrito restaurants have free valet parking  so great especially with slushy snow on the ground even though we were a few minutes early the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately    service was extremely attentive from start to finish waters were refilled quickly bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first the bread came with a delicious spread  was it goat cheese  that i just couldnt stop eating silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced  we ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire nye prix fixe menu none of the eight dishes disappointed the first courses were sea scallops  octopus and duck confit the sea scallop was perfectly cooked the octopus  thought not my cup of tea  was also well cooked and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty i absolutely loved the duck confit dish it was served with mustard greens and fruit with a todiefor dressing  a delicious combination  the second courses were potato gnocchi and mushroom tortelloni the gnocchi was served with lobster which was a unique but nice paring though a strongly flavored dish the tortelloni was delicious and i enjoyed another unique paring tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib  lake ontario walleye and roasted veal strip loin were the third courses both were cooked to perfection the walleyes skin was perfectly crispy and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender however a component of each dish was disappointing  a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal i really cant hold this against casbah though im just not a fan of mustard  finally the desserts was fantastic the chocolate ganache tart was the ending of the sea courses the chocolate was strong even a little bitter and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote i grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish a caramel macaroon completed the land courses the macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce  our experience at casbah was spectacular based on this experience i debated giving the restaurant five stars but decided to wait until i returned a second time and i cant wait to return
