my family visited the restaurant recently there was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family the manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional we are hard working people we expect good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly we have never been treated so disrespectfully there was not even an offer of im sorry for the misunderstandingattention all managers being apologetic in the face of controversy doesnt suggest a weakness there was not even an attempt to right the wrong we work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation my level of disappointment can not be expressed any further than sayingthis was really awful treatment of guests in your restaurant no words
