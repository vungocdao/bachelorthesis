i could visit this place four times and give it four different reviews today there was a long wait at the cutting table which was at first staffed by three different people the little numbergivingout machine was empty so we all just stood in an orderly line one of the women at the cutting table left right after i got there there were five of us in line then saying that she was already late for her break i didnt like to see her go but i understood about the break thing sometimes you really need your break and sometimes your manager really wants you to take your break at the scheduled time   it took a long time to get my stuff cut because one women kept cutting but the other one was helping a customer track down some numbers on a fabric if i was that customer id have been thrilled at that level of service   so i finally got my stuff cut the woman cutting it was very efficient but i think a little rattled from being so busy and admired my choice of fabric hey i love to be validated   i went up front and stood in line some more there were unusually three different people working the registers the woman who checked me out was mellow and chatty and also admired my fabric im starting to think its not my great taste but some new policy   so not a great visit but not the worst either
