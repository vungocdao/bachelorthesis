ive only been here x and both times had a pedicure and gel manicure the first time was okay but the nail tech was rather snotty and had attitude the entire time please if you are offering discount for customers paying in cash you have no reason to be a snot give me a break the nd time i had the same snotty tech and she was just as expectedsnotty the pedicure was a joke and they basically do a quick rub and no true callus removal at all the dryers they use for the gel manicure are old and trashy and have a handmade taped cardboard piece in the middle of it to help you place your hands correctly so that the gel actually adheres well guess what it didnt work and my thumbs were actually chipping the next day when a gel manicure should last  weeks it wasnt worth dealing with them to go back and have it fixed so instead ill just let everyone know not to go there and instead go elsewhere
