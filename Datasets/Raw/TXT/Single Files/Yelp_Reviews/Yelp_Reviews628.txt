famous daves is so much better i use to go here all the time when i was growing up and i loved it i dont know what happened but there food really went down the drain the ribs are dry and black on the bottom and the fries have way too much seasoning i think jon needs to get back in the kitchen instead of spending all his time at the bar next door
