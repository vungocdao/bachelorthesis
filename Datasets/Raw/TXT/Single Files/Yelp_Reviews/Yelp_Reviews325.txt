i totally agree with you that time warner cable has one of the worst customer service i have come across  sorry for the comment  they may be the only service provider in this area that they do not care or the employees have not been paid enough that they do not care about their job  i signed up as they knocked at my door  like someone said we need internet nowadays  we need cable tv in order we can get national or world news more informatory program or some quality programs  they were fast to install for you  but when you do not have service it takes forever to talk to someone on the phone or they hanged you up after waiting forever  however when i wanted to seek their help they would not answer you without a pin and kept transfer you to so many departments really that big i dont know till your phone call dropped  that will take you hours on the phone without a solution  as i need to move and cancel the account they will give you a hard time  watch out this company
