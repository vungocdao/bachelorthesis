came here looking for soup dumplings after having an amazing experience in nycs chinatown i know its really not fair to compare this place with what we had in nyc but i definitely left disappointed   the service was lightening fast but there was definitely the feeling that we received different service since we werent asian for example soup dumplings are pretty impossible to eat without the small porcelain spoon but we received no utensils to eat them with at all   the eggplant was good but was saltier and more sour than i was expecting my mother said that her duck was pretty dry despite the copious amount of sauce on the plate   overall i would say good effort for phoenix but i wont be returning
