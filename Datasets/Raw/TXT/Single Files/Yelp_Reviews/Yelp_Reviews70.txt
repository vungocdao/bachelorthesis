i had a positive experience with this shop i needed something framed at the last minute and within extremely precise parameters that werent easy to abide by and they not only got the work done correctly and on time but at a reasonable price   the staff is a little gruff but not at all unfriendly and i am happy to have found a local shop that i will return to
