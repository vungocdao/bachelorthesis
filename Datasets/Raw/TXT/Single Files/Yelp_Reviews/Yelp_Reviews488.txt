i really wanted to love upstream but it totally fell flat we sat in the bar for some apps and drinks after a movie and it was one disappointment after the next the biggest disappointment of all was the management and this is speaking from two people who worked and lived off of tips in the service industry for years we werent looking for anything but an acknowledgment and somehow felt like we were the ones causing problemsso what happened  we ordered shrimp dumplings and they came out raw we sent them back and somehow were left to feel like we were being unreasonable call me crazy but expect food to be cooked and want to make sure there are no risks to eating said food new ones came out they were great but totally different than first ones of which the management said were slightly undercooked and he was trained that most food was sushi grade call me crazy again but just admit the mistake and we all feel good   lastly the bill came and upstream has the audacity to charge  an oyster for wellfleets dozen whaaaat im a boston gal who knows her seafood never in my life have i seen someone charge that amount nevermind that the menu says they are  but they all of a sudden claimed it was a premium oyster at a different price  i can forgive mishaps and mistakes  it happens to the best of us i cannot accept management who is so cavalier and dismissing to their guests  prices are high here and that is no issue for me for great food and service however not acceptable if you cant deliver on those fronts
