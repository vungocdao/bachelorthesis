dont go here if you have small children this is a museum for  and up if you are over  and have a love for fire engines and their history then this place is great this is not a place to go if you have young children that want to climb on everything you are not even allowed to touch the railings that surround the fire trucks the childrens exhibit and the one firetruck that you are allowed to climb on seem like an afterthought  beware of the old men at the front as well they dont seem too excited to have children there
