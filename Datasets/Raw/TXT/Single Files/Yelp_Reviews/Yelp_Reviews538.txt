i was hoping the previous reviewer had merely had a bad stay andor the property had updated since then but no such luck  the beds here are rocks  it felt like i was sleeping on a box spring instead of a mattress and a really had and painful one at that  when we got up in the morning that phrase in quotations as it implies we had a good nights sleep which we didnt my husband pointed out that the side of the mattress was slumping so it was probably very old  definitely not marriott standard  wireless internet was slow but a cat was provided in the room for laptops that got internet up to speed just fine  breakfast when i had it was good  perhaps previous reviewer came down late  a little on the crowded side but the biscuits were delicious  all in all the stay was great except for the beds but unfortunately thats a huge thing that needs to be good when youre staying at a hotel  sorry guys
