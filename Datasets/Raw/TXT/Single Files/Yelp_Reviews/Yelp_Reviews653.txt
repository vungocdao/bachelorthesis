i love culvers as a company first  they are solid through and through    each location varies a little but i think on the whole the parent company does enough to keep the franchises in line very well  ive never been disappointed with any culvers at which ive eaten  this location does everything well  i work near here so i go here at least once a week for lunch and have for probably the last four years  i have never had a single complaint  even when theyre busy they manage to keep the place looking well and getting the food out fast and hot  the only knock i could issue against this place is the layout of their parking lot isnt great  it could get fixed  if you park on the righthand side of the lot you can get stuck in your space if theres a long line at the drivethru
