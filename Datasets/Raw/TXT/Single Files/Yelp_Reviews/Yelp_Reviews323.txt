ive stayed here for four years in a row and this go around have noticed a serious decline in service and quality  there was only one employee available to check people in and after a full day i waited  minutes to check in  as a result i didnt have time to go up to the room before leaving for dinner  they said that my bags would be delivered to my room but when i got back at  pm ready to collapse they were no where to be found  there was standing water in the tub and the shower head was only partially working  not the kind of experience i expect from a hotel where there are additional fees for everything  im talking  for one day of parking    i have high standards for this place since my previous stays have been great  why are you slacking westin charlotte
