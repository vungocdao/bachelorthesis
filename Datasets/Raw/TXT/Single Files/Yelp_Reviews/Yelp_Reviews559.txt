this goodwill is probably the busiest in charlotte and has aboveaverage selection in each dept  they have good variety of clothes shoes books furniture and housewares  the selling point at this store as you might have guessed by reading my views is the book selection  unlike other stores they have a steady rotation of new titles nearly new for really cheap  im regularly surprised by their furniture selection  if my house wasnt cluttered like your grandmas crib i would pick up a table or even a couch here  also this place is freakin mecca for used appliances  i always see a selection of used microwaves coffee makers and blenders  the clothes are nice not as nice as the matthews plantation but you can still find some amazing deals on brand name clothes    please be warned saturdays is not a good day to shop due to crowds of crying screaming children  plus you wouldnt want to get in altercation with aggressive shoppers over a  beer stein  try a weekday before  or so  happy treasure hunting
