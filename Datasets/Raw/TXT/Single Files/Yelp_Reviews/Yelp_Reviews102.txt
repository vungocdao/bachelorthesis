i went here for the first time on saturday night i had to go  try the famous giant fish sandwich when it arrived i was impressed the fish was even bigger than i expected  the batter was perfect also the beer menu is lengthy they serve beers from almost every corner of the world i thought about trying something new but turns out i was homesick for a good old pennsylvania beer  rolands is definitely a cool place in my book ill be back p
