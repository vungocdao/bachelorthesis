i booked a hair apt here after reading some of the reviews on yelp hoping id find a place to get my hair cut after moving to pittsburgh from nj maybe it was just the hairdresser i booked an appointment with but i did not have a great experience im a nurse who works mostly day shifts and i value sleep over styling my hair in the morning i tried to articulate that i wanted a hair cut that required minimal styling on my part the hairdresser immediately shot me down asking me how i expected to have my hair look nice if i wasnt willing to put work into it she then berated me for not using styling products again id rather sleep   now maybe a few people feel differently about their hair but all i wanted was a cut that allowed for minimal styling on my part i wasnt asking for some trendy do that needed  different products a round brush and a flat iron in order to recreate it i ended up getting almost the same exact cut i had going in there just an inch shorter oh and she also told me the cut i had coming in wasnt entirely flattering because of its blunt ends funny i ended up with the same thing   this experience has definitely made me decide never to go back for  i expect a little bit better service and a little bit nicer treatment oh and somewhere that isnt constantly pushing products
