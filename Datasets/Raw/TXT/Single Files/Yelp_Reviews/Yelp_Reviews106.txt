prime time location and they know it  yet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it  the place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city  i have always steered clear of rolands because of an assumption  butthe wife and her friend wanted a lobster roll so i was roped into going  i opted to just drink a draught  they got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed  the sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries the best part  it also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw  the roll itself was lobster but was fishy tasting and had no sauce  there was maybe ozs of fishy lobster on the rollpathetic service was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves  go to wholey
