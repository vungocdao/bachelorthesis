i really wanted to get grub at prices but they dont have a dining area and i didnt want to get take out  came here for lunch  waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved  free cornbread was average   i had the fried chicken and sides of mashed potatoes and mac n cheese  surprisingly none of it was really that good  service was cheerful though  i guess the best part was i was able to park in downtown charlotte found a free spot and wasnt towed when i was done eating here
