the food was okay but some of the staff are very rude and uncourteous i had a very unpleasant encounter during lunch time once when the person serving the food demanded a better tip from me when i was leaving the restaurant i had actually tipped him fairly well and i think it is very unprofessional to vocally demand for more money even otherwise he did not seem to care that i was a regular at the restaurant before this incident and i have decided never to visit the place again
