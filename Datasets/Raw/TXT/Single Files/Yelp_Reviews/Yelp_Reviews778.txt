ive hesitated to write about fate i always enjoyed the food and experience at the owners old lucky dragon even back when it was on university i also appreciate the fact that fate is a downtown pioneer and that one can eat there after   weve been to fate a number of times with vaguely disappointing results after this visit  weve had it   im not really high on the this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time style of user review so let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits yet never all at once fate however put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco   i dont know if fates policy is to have the hostesshost inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes but the math doesnt work out the place is tiny we waited forty minutes the next group waited fiftyfive minutes the next few groups are probably still waiting their oncevital bodies deteriorating into skeletons  the server dropped off some menus mentioned that she was going to bring us some water and then vanished as if she were an illusionists assistant again fate is tiny so the trick was pretty difficult  anyway we ordered after she rematerialized after the required fifteen minutes stuff arrived it was the old joke  the food here is terrible and such small portions  ill spare most of the hideous details but one lowlight to share involved the sesameshrimpsalad item im hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightlyoff fish sauce rather than some slightlyoff shrimp actually why do i care we felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash our cat still wouldnt come near us   anyway i dont mean to imply that the owner and staff at fate are malicious the food isnt good enough and the experience isnt good enough oh if youre uncomfortable with ikea furnishings im fine dont even try it
