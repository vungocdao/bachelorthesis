yeah this place is horrible ive been here for just under  years and i wish i was able to have moved out before i renewed my lease the previous staff was alright at least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no sense of urgency or how to run a business because the rent payment process is for the most part automated there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up with that being said the model and the common area are far more upgraded and modern than the apartments them selves the apts have  year old appliances and we were told well if they work then they are working by design and we cant replace them but did i mention that they raised the rent after the st year for what no property improvements have been made the same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true waste and pet waste all over stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen   the pool is never clean the hot tub doesnt work you can see the grossness in the water floating on top there are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go the resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out the place is crawling with bugs my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where the walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas bandaid approach to fixing things every month it is a new issue they do not send out notices when complex wide issuesfixes will be happening it really just is a crap place to live better options for  a month and crappy service
