my fiancee and i have been putting off going back to see the university of illinois campus for a while now we saw that super  was having a crazy anniversary sale on rooms where if you booked online on a certain date and time your room would only be  we decided this would be the perfect oppurtunity to head down to champaign so we tried to book the room and got it  this is the point where i tell you if i had paid any more than  i would have felt ripped off the room smelled very weird that smell that makes you think someone could have died in there but they used enough chemicals to kill every last skin cell the bedding was very itchy and the shower curtain didnt even have any plastic liner to keep the water in the tub the only positives the reason it gets two stars instead of one were that there was good pressure in the shower and the location was not bad honestly though unless it is a crazy deal like we had there are better hotels in the area there is even a nicer super  near lincoln avenue
