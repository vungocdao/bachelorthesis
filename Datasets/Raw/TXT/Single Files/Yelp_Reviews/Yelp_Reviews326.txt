time warner cable is an incompetent company that runs a monopoly on internet services in certain neighborhoods  they will enroll you in bill pay then charge you late fees when their service fails to draw funds  not failure to draw funds from a lack of cash in the account  no this is a failure to draw funds because their billing department is complete and utter garbage  their services are sub par and they over charge for this shit service because as previously stated they run the only line available for entire neighborhoods and small towns through out the charlotte area
