when i was younger my aunt and uncle and cousins lived in kenosha wi  we would drive up a few times a year to visit them and after  hours of peering out the car windows along  my brother and cousins and i would be dying to get out of the car at any of the attractions along the waysix flags the outlet malls or any of the many cheese shops that announced your arrival to wisconsin    when i went skiing with friends at cascade mountain last winter years of unfulfilled longing swept over me and i demanded that we stop at one  the one we selected was the mousehouse cheesehaus chosen mostly for its cute sign and awesome name  being a lover of all things dairy walking in i beelined for the cheese counter demanding samples of anything and everything  oh my  anything from a basic kid friendly american to a  year aged cheddar to their own special haus cheese  i probably walked out with a good  lbs of various cheeses and am still wondering how those seemed to add  lbs to my figure but thats another story  in addition there were the usual wisconsin knick knacks including many types of beers wines and other kitschy stuff like ashtrays and bottle openers  the woman working at the counter didnt seem too charmed by my friends and i but im sure i would tire of travelers demanding cheese nibbles after a while myself
