i have always enjoyed myself here ive dined and drank and drank and drank  a few highlights of radio are  their absinthe service which is quite a production i dont feel like i can really do it justice by describing it but you will not be disappointed if you order up a couple absinthe drinks  they offer the wheel which is a  oz shot of each of their beers on tap they have about  beers on tap and many are the darker craft ales which in addition to being really tasty are higher in proof you need a couple of people to do this right and there are some rules but if you are already planning on cabbing it home this is a great way to learn about beer and get drunked  their kitchen stays open all night nuff said  radio is one of the very best places to sit outside on a nice summer night get a table at dusk put your back to the window and watch the night unfold
