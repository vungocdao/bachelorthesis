this place was noted as a must visit location during my last trip to pittsburgh i must say it was definitely worth the visit   to all reading this be aware that essentially this is just a grocery store were talking about here however the rustic building and kitchy offerings like pour your own olive oilor taste our cheeses makes it kind of special   when i was given this recommendation i was told head to the back to where the cheese is so i did whoa  so much more cheese than i ever expected but no macaroni and cheeseboo   they should really consider serving mac and cheese   thats all
