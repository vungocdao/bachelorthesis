the steaks here are very good  its the same quality as the other high end places prime cuts aged etc  however i love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter  thats something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops  i love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table  i had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isnt that good  the  bartenders are competent but the atmosphere is pretty lame  its kind of an afterthought it seems  oh yeah and they dont have guiness on tap  im going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap  i mean how do you not at a steakhouse  if you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere  the service is very good  the crab stuffed mushrooms are okay but they certainly arent noteworthy  the mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay but i think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat something you cant get at the local grocery  overall a very fine experience  id rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners mortons capital grille  ruth chris hyde park  and for bar area and bar dining capital grille hyde park mortons ruth chris
