i love the capital brewery because i think it encompasses everything that is quintessentially wisconsin capital brewery makes consistently highquality german lagers with a few good ales thrown in for good measure and provides a lowkey nofrills environment that can be whatever you want it to be the beer garden bier garten is huge filled with weatherbeaten picnic tables and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun trees insulate the place and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as westside andy and the mel ford band people bring their kids their dogs decks of cards and board games and enjoy the excellent beer thats doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff bring your own food  some local joints like the roman candle will even deliver right to your picnic table and if the weathers not so nice you can visit the bier stube capitals indoor bar which is full of dark rich wood and nice people i highly recommend the capital brewery and dont forget to take the short tour
