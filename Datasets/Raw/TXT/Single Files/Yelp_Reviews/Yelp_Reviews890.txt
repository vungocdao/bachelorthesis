maybe the current economy has forced tacos de juarez to make some cutbacks in the quality of their food because our recent experience was nowhere near as good as everyone else seems to have had we live mere blocks from here so we felt it was about time we tried it   the chips and tostada base tasted off as if the oil they were fried in was a little rancid the cheese on the cheese crisp was plentiful and pretty oily my husband called the cheese in his chile relleno the most tasteless he had ever had as was the relleno batter   i ordered a   but wanted to substitute a hard taco for the cheese enchilada i checked the a la carte prices and knew that the taco was actually less expensive so i was sure i wasnt going to be screwing them over i cant tell you how long it took me to try and explain what i wanted to our server im sure there are those who would say its my fault for not speaking spanish anyway i ended up getting my tostada and the hard taco but no taquito and no rice and beans then another  minutes of my life went by as i tried to explain again what i had ordered when the server asked if everything was alright but that really no one needed to bring me out any more food i had had enough by that point and knew it would already be a pepcid ac kind of night the cook and the server argued and finally the server understood that she had gotten my order wrong they comped my food which wasnt necessary but they insisted my taco and tostada were just alright the beans in the tostada were cold which i am not used to  weve had everything better somewhere else and feel no need to return
