ive never eaten at hardees  ive been to hardees twice once was waaay back in  or so when i went in and ordered some chicken tenders they told me they were out of chicken tenders  so id have to order something else pass ive been avoiding it ever since  yesterday boyfriend and friends wanted hardees i figured it was time to let bygones be bygones so i went to hardees and ordered the threechickentender combo basket with curly fries and a drink the girl behind the counter was efficient but rushed which is kind of what i expect from fast food employees so im not really fazed by that my friends were already seated and served so i filled my beverage and sat with them i made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table as directed  boyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as i sit down this is normal  friend a finishes his burger about five minutes later still no sign of my food  friend b finishes her meal by now its been ten minutes hmm  i notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have finished at this point  i check my receipt its been fifteen minutes my friends need to get back to work i flag down the next passing employee who happens to be the manager i ask him what had happened to my food manager disappears comes back three or so minutes later apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer  and they burned so rest assured they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so  no  i tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund he was sincere and apologetic which i appreciate but at this point i had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food im patient for the most part but there was no offer to comp the meal just hey keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes maybe i understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush but how no one noticed that one order wasnt filled for   minutes just boggles my mind i took the money from my refund and went next door to taco bell where i was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness i really love the taco bell on neil its clean friendly and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome i even make substitutions and deletions to my order and they have never gotten it wrong so the moral of this story in short  save your time and money by skipping hardees and go next door to taco bell
