i ate here this past saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions  we arrived at around  pm and were quoted for a  minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back  the wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of il pizzaiolo  the wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door  eventually the crowd quieted down and i was able to see a beautiful bar a fireplace with chairs bookcases full of books on wine and italy and some trendy paintings  after about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room  the main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that i can remember that really stuck out  our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the arancini since we were hungry  it came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good  for dinner i was having a hard time deciding on whether i should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both  my pasta entree was the paglia e fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce  the tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce  it also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever i was done  my pizza was the diavola since i like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami chile pepper basil and different cheese  once again the colors were nice and i absolutely loved the pizza especially some of the pieces where i got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese  my dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service  the bottom line for me is that i would definitely come back here in the future  the food was fantastic and not as expensive as i had expected while the service was good  i would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into
