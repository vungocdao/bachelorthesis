its a nice airport to have a layover in free wifi is only for  minutes but there are tons of eateries shopping and even a spa  the only thing that sucks is if you have a short layover and have to run from one end of the airport to the other to make your plane  its a huge airport on my layover on my way out i did get to enjoy a great lox sandwich at einstein bros bagels   on my way back i had  minutes to get to my plane  i suppose i should have asked one of the carts for help
