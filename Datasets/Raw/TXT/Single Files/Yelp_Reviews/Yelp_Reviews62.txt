this was my second visit and alas my last   our first visit was at lunch and it was just ok we werent blown away nor were we impressed but i will always opt to support a local mom  pop shop if all things are equal this last visit was the pits  it was pm on a saturday night we were one of two tables this is usually an indication of something fishy excuse the pun appetizer was edamame it was overcooked and left uneaten i am not the adventurous sushi ordere
