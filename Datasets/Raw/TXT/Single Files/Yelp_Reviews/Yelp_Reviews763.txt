i have been going to this ihop every month for  years our group is anywhere from  to  there are only two places in the restaurant that accommodate groups and for the most part we have been seated relatively quickly over the past year service has gone down hill it started taking forever to get our order taken get our drinks or get our food we are a very forgiving bunch and know its not easy to serve a large group but as service started really sliding our last trip ended the relationship we had about  people and knew we would have to wait a bit but after  minutes we inquired how long and it was like your waiting for a tablethe kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups how can you not remember a group when they take up the whole lobby we called a near by breakfast place and they were thrilled to have our party which grew smaller since some left at that point we found a new home and they will get  stars on my review
