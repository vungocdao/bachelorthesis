tried this place based upon the yelp reviews my girlfriend  i had hamburgers i also had a salad with the best  island dressing ive ever had  my girlfriend did not want onions and her burger came out with them they quickly brought her a new one we finished up with a huge turtle sundae we shared caution this sundae is not for only one person  our service was satisfactory and we arrived before the dinner rush pm so seating was easy at pm the place had a significant queue but it was a saturday night and the barrymore had an event   overall the fare the cost and the atmosphere make this a must try
