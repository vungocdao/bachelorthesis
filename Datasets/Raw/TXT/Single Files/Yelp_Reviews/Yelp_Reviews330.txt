taking in a surprise   taking a light outdoor walk from camden southend to the streets of uptown charlotte sure makes one hungry the first place that caught my eye was a resilient green light coming off south tryon it was so bright it was reflecting off the mirror statue at the betchlor museum across the street the next thing i know i am staring the menu at the best table in the house if you have ever walked past this place you know what table it is the light music and privacy of the booth makes for intimate conversation and romantic situations the comfortable and spacious booth allows you to play footsy all night without hurting yourself   i had the mussels which were euphoric cooked in some type of wine butter and cream which happen to be damn good when mixed together my palate was very pleased and upset at the same time pleased with the sauce from the mussels running down my face but upset when the last empty shell fell with the others happily in a coma after being satisfied by a taste i could only once wonder about i got myself the check i didnt care how much it was it was good the service was astounding and i was so comfortable at this point i could not even set a price on this kind of experience popped it open and to my surprise i walked out of there paying less than  for two peoplewines appitizersdesserts   after stumbling to the door trying to shake off my coma i gave one glance back at the place of magic and thought to myself ill be back here before i know it to take on a new adventure for my taste buds
