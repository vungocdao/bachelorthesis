so i thought reading their menu seeing it in chinese language and in the  chinese district    it could be a real find  i love dives with surprisingly good food   i was soooooo disappointed  the egg drop soup was vegetable soup and just warm  a minute after my soup was served my main course came out  it had two itemspea pods and pork  not very bbq flavor rather a funny flavor  no other veges such as water chestnuts or bamboo shoots  the minimal sauce was very bland  the rice was not fresh
