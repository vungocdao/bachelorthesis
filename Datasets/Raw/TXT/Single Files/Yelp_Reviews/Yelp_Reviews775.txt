i have been here multiple times for all facets of dinning including lunch dinner drinks late night bites and a corporate function and everytime ive liked it it is one of my favorite places to go before a baseball or basketball game they have a great selection of handcrafed beers both on tap and in bottles there food is also really good for what i take as more of a bar enviornment there burgers sandwiches and pastas are all well executed and have a gourmet flair with resonable prices the lobster bisque is fantastic and so are the salads and appetizers they have a great patio downstairs and a balcony where you can eat and drink outside upstairs too check this place out it is more than worth the visit and they have good happy hour and reverse happy hour specials
