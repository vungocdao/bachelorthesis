just went to the pirate exhibit this weekend and i want to write a review because it was by far the coolest one yet  i have been to the body exhibit the titanic exhibit and others there  of course there is more to do there than just that for the kids they blow stuff up at the lab they have tons of cool little sections with things to do  it is not cheap but we got the annual pass for the exhibits this year since we did the maze and we wanted to come back for the pirate and the van gogh exhibit coming next  now back to the pirate exhibit holy cow they had a real life pirates treasure at the end that was valued at  million dollars  the have tons of real pieces of  they also recovered the bell from the original ship they found off the cost of cape cod  there was their silverware belt buckles guns cannons gold silver rope and i can go on forever  it was just super cool to hear the story and see all the real life stuff  this is not just a kid exhibit and in fact i spent much more time reading things and my kids blew right through it
