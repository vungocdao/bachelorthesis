great tailoring hands down ive had jeans taken in dresses altered and hems taken up  all perfectly done i will say though that you get what you pay for ie its not affordable tailoring  a pair of jeans cost  to be taken in and  for hemmed pants or dress while i personally think its worth it for expert tailoring others may think its a bit overpriced for some of the basic tailoring   also the staff are all very nice and will give very helpful tailoring advice when asked you can trust your nicest pieces here  they are in good hands
