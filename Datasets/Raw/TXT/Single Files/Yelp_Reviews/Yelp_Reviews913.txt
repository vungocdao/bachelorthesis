the staff are great actually the room is well noisy but the kindness of all staff compensates for any other problem i received several boxes in the hotel i was not charged for receiving them at any time and any member of the staff made no comment about it i really enjoyed all the hotel service and location except for the noise is great  very easy access recommend without any disorder
