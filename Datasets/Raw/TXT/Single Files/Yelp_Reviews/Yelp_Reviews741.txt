this place was highly recommended by our friends and we were hoping to also like it first off i called and asked if i could bring a small birthday cake for my husbands birthday the lady on the phone said it was not an issue we got there and it was packed on a friday night the hostess said it would be  minutes for a table literally two seconds later there was a four person table cleared i asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us the place was busy and noisy  the menu was limited and average priced for most items i craved noodles so ordered the padseiw the noodles were alright somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower the hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice  later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us  dollars for bringing our own cake nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us  so sadly we will not be returning thai rama has much better food and service
