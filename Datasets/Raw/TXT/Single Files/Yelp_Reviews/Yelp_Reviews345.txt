merts is true southern soul food  not the new american type but the real stuff  macncheese green beans cooked in animal fat salmon cakes fried chicken  its all good  i love the macncheese and will often just order a veggie plate where i can pick  different ones to eat  they always have vegetable specials so i can try something new every time i go    they also had  different hot sauces on the table  i made a point to sample them all on the delicious corn bread they make
