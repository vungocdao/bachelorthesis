hubby insisted we had eaten here before i thought not i was partly right as we have eaten at the good egg before and not been very pleased hubby had hated their crepeeggs we didnt know the connection between the two restaurants before we sat down  starving i order their farmhouse eggs benedict and hubby orders their breakfast quesadilla and an oreo pancake he just had to try it we both get iced tea and it tastes funny like it was made with bad tap water when the food arrives hubby inhales his quesadilla but says nothing about its quality the oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table i gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy the only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs the turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right its not crispy and the taste is off the biscuits taste like they are from a mix to top it off the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table nice can you at least pretend you didnt just give me the leftover water from someone elses table our server never returns to fill our tea except when dropping off the check or even to see how things are maybe he knows better than to ask
