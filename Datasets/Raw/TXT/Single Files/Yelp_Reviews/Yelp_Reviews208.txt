i think this restaurant fits american taste because i was the only non american to eat here just now even though the seats are fully occupied it doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine it is very chinese and i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant the sushi is not even firmly made  i am not saying the food is bad it is actually alright   but they have a great interior and place
