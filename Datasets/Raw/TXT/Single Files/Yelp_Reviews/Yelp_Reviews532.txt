this is now called cabos mexican grill   this is the nd time visiting and nd time being disappointed the first time i went with a group of  other friends the service was less than okay and food was mediocre nothing really memorable  the nd time was a couple of weeks ago name change but the bad service stayed  went with a group of about    people on a thursday night right of the top we realized that the waiter was less than eager to serve us we ordered drinks and our food food took longer than what we expected even with a big group the server never filled up our water glasses and kept forgetting things we asked for to make matters worse the manager seemed to notice our struggles so he came over and asked what we needed we told him and to our surprise he never came back with what we asked worst part we were so ready to leave and couldnt our checks where laying at a table next to us but we must have waited  minutes for our waiter to show up and pick them up   i am rating it  stars because the place was clean and the food here might have been okay but the terrible service didnt let us enjoy it
