i live across the street and visit often could not ask for a better atmosphere with a view of the inside of chase field the customer service has always been great often times it get dinner to go and the bartenders are friendly and chat it up while i wait just the traditional fridays menu but the location makes it worth going definite place to check out when you are downtown doesnt have to be a game day
