yes it is a chain but some chains are good  the only reason i didnt give the palm five stars is because you need a  oz steak  us chicks cant handle  ounces    i love the fillet  i get it with the oscar option and i cant talk or think about anything else while i am eating it  perfectly cooked i like mediumrare perfectly seasoned slightly salty perfectly served in a little bit of au jus  i had happy dreams for dayssigh    the app we got was the baconwrapped scallops  perfectly cooked and served on a bed of spinach  just fantastic  i love the old school bread sticks in the wrapper  such a perfect way to shovel the palm butter into my piehole    service is excellent  fast and knowledgeable about every dish and historic artifact about the palm  love it  this location valets which i recommend because you will need someone to roll you out after you have eaten every last drop  cant wait for the next special occasion   d
