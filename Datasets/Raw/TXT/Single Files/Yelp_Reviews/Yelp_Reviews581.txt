my wifes mini cooper had to have its engine replaced she no longer felt comfortable driving that car we visited nissan honda toyota and vw dealerships and ultimately had the best experience with zimbrick vw in middleton otto was very helpful he was not pushy and gave us all the information we needed to make a decision  zimbrick made a very fair offer to trade in the mini but we ended up selling it ourselves once my wifes car was sold otto made the process very quick and easy so we had her in her new passat the same day he even stayed after closing to walk her through setting up her new car  when i replace my toyota rav i will definitely consider zimbrick vw
