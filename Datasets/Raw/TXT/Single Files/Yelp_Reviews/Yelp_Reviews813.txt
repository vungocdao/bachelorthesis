one of my favorite veggie sandwiches ever  the sandwich is called wheres the beef and any menu planner  company owner with a sense of humor is aok in my book  comes with tomatoes celery sprouts lettuce avocados cucumbers jicama and pinenuts  i recommend adding spicy mustard and havarti cheese  great place for a downtown lunch  there are lots of places that do sadwiches  i go to jacquees for good boars head meat i go to sticklers for the delicious fresh bread and i go to dd for the unique hot and signature sandwiches on their menu  soups change daily as does a flavored tea staff is hit or miss on friendliness  today i got to try the buffalo chicken soup and was impressed then again how can you go wrong with a creamy chicken soup with that tangy spicy buffalo flavor the good news i could probably eat  bowls the bad news i could probably eat  bowls calorie counters  stay away from this soup  dd can get very busy around noon along with many of the downtown places  i suggest calling in your order if you dont want to wait or you can even use their website to order online  cool
