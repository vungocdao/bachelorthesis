if you didnt know where it was youd miss it  dining area is sparse basic tables and booths open delistyle    got the chicken parm sub as recommended by yelpers  mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich  still not sure i would order it again  fries are standard crinklecut    summary good place as alternative to nearby fast food joints but i wouldnt go out of my way to come again
