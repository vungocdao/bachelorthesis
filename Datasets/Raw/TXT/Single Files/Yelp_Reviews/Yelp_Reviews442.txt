disclaimer ive only passed through this airport for connection flights and ive never had much of a lay over   its not as big as many of the other hubs like detroit atlanta and minneapolis but its still big enough to need a tram of some sort ive not spotted a tram if there is one here the moving sidewalks just dont cut it when your connecting flight is already boarding many of the moving sidewalks and there are a lot of them werent working as in out of service even an escalator was out of service if youve ever wondered what its like to tote a carry on luggage up stairs ill inform you that its not very fun   the bathroom had an attendant but the bathroom wasnt as clean as many of the other airport bathrooms that ive used there werent any toilet seat covers some airports even have the rotating plastic seat covers so nothing at all is very behind in the time   there was a food court and an area that had rocking chairs that was a first time that ive noticed rocking chairs in an airport i didnt use them it was just another observation plus i was trying to note something positive about this airport
