ive never been to new orleans so i dont know if that makes me somehow less qualified to review this place  but i suspect a fair amount of people have never been to china and it doesnt stop them from reviewing pf changs  anyway the thing about noto whenever i have eaten there is that i am always expecting it to be way greater than it really is because of the way people talk about it  i am always expecting this transcendent experience but really all i get is a styrofoam container of some spicy slop that really has no real flavor underneath the initial tongue shock of cayenne pepper
