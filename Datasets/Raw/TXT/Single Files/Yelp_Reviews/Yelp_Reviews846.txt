my friend and i decided to try out tgi fridays for a beer during the baseball game to get a bigger bang for our buck for what we would pay for a small hot dog and  oz beer we could get a great meal larger beers and great service right wrong   the restaurant was not very crowded for a game night yet we were denied a table overlooking the stadium twice the manager asked us to visit the hostess stand to get a table but they informed us there was a wait no one was in line for the restaurant   i had to get our own menus from the bar after playing lets avoid making eye contact and maybe she will go away after we ordered three sets of people were sat in the tables we were waiting for and their meals came out before our order   our waiter ended up offering us a free beer for the late arrival of our food and ended up comping our entire check but that will be my last visit front row   id rather pay  for a beer and  for a processed hot dog than to get snobbed by anyone in the service industry all i wanted was a good time after a work day from hell and to enjoy a diamondbacks game
