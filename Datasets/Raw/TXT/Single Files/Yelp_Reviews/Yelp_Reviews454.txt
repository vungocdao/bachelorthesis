i made an appointment because i had an terrible stabbing ear ache after waiting nearly an hour after my appointment time i was quickly ushered into a tiny room and without being asked anything i was given a hearing test i never asked for it and dont know why it was done then after another long waiting period the doctor finally saw me and he tells me i have hearing loss he looks into my aching ear and bluntly tells me i have no infection but rather tmj which really really scared me i think he was wrong because two days later i had infected bumps on the side of my face and after it cleared no more pain the entire visit was a horrible waste of time which didnt help me at all and took nearly three hours
