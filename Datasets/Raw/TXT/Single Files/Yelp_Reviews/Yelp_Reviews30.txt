ive been here quite a few times and i always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near pitt they have a ton of nice hdtvs  everytime i go there is always a weird taste to one or more of the beers that i get i was just there for the pittoakland game and got a redhook i drink this beer regularly and something was wrong with the beer its definitely hard to describe but something is always off others in my party notice it too  the food is hit or miss i got the french onion soup last time it was good nothing ground breaking but solid soup ive had the pork nachos and they were blah
