  stars   one of the few places where i can safely say that anything you order from the menu will be sure to please mimosa is one of downtown charlottes original great restaurants there long before all the big chain steakhouses decided to take up residence this place is as safe as it gets and doesnt break the bank doing it the decor is very fashionable and presents a really nice atmosphere without feeling too white tableclothlike  i really like the upscale southern idea and not many places in the country can pull it off as well or as consistently as mimosa does they specialize in local produce and meats doing a great job of supporting all the great foods natural to nc any time one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant is a beefsteak salad you know they focus on all the details because it takes a lot more than you would think to make a really good salad  whether youre a charlotte native or just visiting the city for business mimosa should definitely be on your list of places to try if you want a real taste of charlotte it may be easy to go with the big chains like mortons capital grill and ruths chris but your money will be much better spent and go a lot further here
