i had really high hopes and i was thrilled that its so close to my house however i soon started second guessing myself after pulling up i was there before anyone else and watched the attendant avoid my car and instead go to the  old guys in expensive sport cars that showed up  or so minutes after me and she even waited a little longer after that like she was hoping another car would pull up when one didnt she finally came to my car and her attitude sucked on top of it its not like i own a nasty beat up car either its a newer mitsubishi after telling her i wanted a full interior detail and an exterior wash i went inside and sat around for a few hours when it was finally done i got what i expected a nice shiny clean car with a soaking wet interior granted ive never had an interior detail before but i didnt expect everything to be sopping wet regardless of that they actually put down a plastic cover over my seat for me but since i had to stop at some place afterwards i accidently ripped it and then had to ride around with a wet bottom i was told to keep the windows cracked an inch or  and did the whole weekend however now my car kinda stinks and im going to be pissed if theres mold or mildew factoring into that im not happy and im not going back either im giving them  stars because they did what i asked them to do they cleaned my car  ps i work at an insurance company i spoke to an appraiser and found out that places should really be doing a dry shampoo to avoid screwing up the foam bits they have under your carpets and inside your seat
