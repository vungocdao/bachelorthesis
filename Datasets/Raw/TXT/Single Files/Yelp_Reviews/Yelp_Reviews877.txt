geeeross  the other half and i got takeout for this place   but first a little backstory  my dads whole family worked at a chinese restaurant in philly from before i was born until the late s  my mother says she craved chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on chinese in the womb i bless her for having done so i love chinese and could eat it every daywillingly  ive tried chinese in every city and country ive ever lived or visited as i always love to see whats out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations i can usually find something good no matter how nasty or base a buffet or madetoorder  and lord knows i love takeout and a movie on the sofa  great nite rite  a few weeks ago i convinced the better half to go pick up gourmet house of hong kong if i paid and he drove deal done  i ordered on the phone  no problems its rite down the street from our house so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within  minutes  we queued up the dvd and were ready to go  the fried rice was yummy and ok  not the best ive had but not the worst either  the bbq pork app was good and i liked the dipping sauce it came with everything else was skank  id say avoid the noodles at all costs they were like nasty overcooked spaghetti in a watery flavorless sauce  even with soy sauce added they did nothing for me    im kind of sad bc the other reviews on yelp seemed pretty good  the place is not that great looking from the outside and never having been inside i cant comment on that  but i would never get takeout from here again  at least we didnt get sick  it was just blandorama which makes me sad  i even threwout the leftovers which has only ever happened  one other time with chinese takeout when i left for vacation the next day and didnt want to stink up the fridge
