for my th review i thought about writing about beaches in san diego art centers in los angeles cafes in new mexico or bookstores in boston  but it seemed right to focus on the mass transit district of champaignurbana the bus system that keeps my life in order    i moved a month ago to chambana and it has quickly become apparent that i do not live in southern california any more  the land is flat the wind comes sweeping through the place is smaller in scope and im rapidly realizing that im not going to want to rely on my car when the snow falls from the sky  enter champaignurbana mass transit district  theres no need for a parking permit when there are countless continuously running lines covering the entire area  my weekday mornings find me checking my house looking through my backpack making sure all my stuff is in order before frantically hustling down the street in order to catch the  silver south line to campus which runs twice an hour    if im worried about catching the bus the mtd has a text messaging service where you can text the bus line with a number and get real time information for when the bus is arriving  let me tell you a text message has saved me more than once from missing the last bus before class starts   the website is unfortunately abbreviated httpwwwcumtdcom but wonderfully comprehensive  ive had generally great luck with the drivers on the    and  and im really glad to have made it to a place with really accessible constant reliable mass transit  im slightly less worried about gas prices as its free for university students to ride the everpresent cumtd system   in short thank you so much chambana mtd for getting me where i need to go all the time every time
