i was across the street for a dr appointment and decided to step into the ajs after to browse since it was right there havent been into one in years for the same reason that i probably wont return after the recent visit way overpriced for things i can buy elsewhere almost everything in the store you can buy at any regular grocery store and pay less for it they do carry a small number of gourmet items on the shelves but i can find those other places too   so youd think that their deli or bakery or something would stand out but not that i can tell i was going to try something from the bakery case but it was all way overpriced and totally unimpressive looking i was there in the am so i did try a slice of the breakfast pizza that was out in the deli first off it took me several minutes to be served because the staff was busily ignoring me then when i did finally get my slice i went to pay and eat it and the thing was cold and chewy the crust was just so tough the eggs were somewhat dried out i was seriously underwhelmed   the store was practically dead the whole time i was wandering around the staff outnumbered the patrons by far how do these places stay in business you wont get more money from me ajs
