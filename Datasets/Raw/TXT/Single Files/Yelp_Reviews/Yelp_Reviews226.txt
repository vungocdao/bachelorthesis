this is a better than average lets say very solid  sushi restaurant    we had the omakase and had some delicious bite sized courses  but strangely the little bites never added up to feeling super full which could be a good thing but devouring a chocolate pretzel dessert isnt really the perfect end to omakase    the miso black cod was excellent the sashimi was well executed and clearly the chef had many many years of traditional sushi training  but for some reason my socks just werent blown off  more sushi and sashimi could have done the trick  on the other hand the desserts were delicious and memorable which come from the restaurant downstairs soba  great atmosphere attentive service and will def go back  at the same time im open to finding alternatives in pittsburgh too optimistic  and dr freddie fu is a fan see autographed picture on sushi bar  not sure what this means but maybe if i return i will be further enlightened
