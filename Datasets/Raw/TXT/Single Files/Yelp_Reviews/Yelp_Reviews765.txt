yum this place is yummy it is my favorite authentic mexican restaurant to take outoftowners to the doormansecurity guard is so sweet and makes sure you dont get shot and that your car is there after your meal the surrounding area is a bit tough and i dont suggest wandering far from the parking lot if you know what i mean the somewhat scary location makes everything a bit more authentic in my eyes  i made the mistake of ordering chicken once and i was disappointed not sure why  maybe it is because they dont use all white meat chicken or maybe it was an off day or maybe i just dont like their chicken i dont know but now i stick with beef or cheese based items and everything i get is super delish love the beans they do em right margaritas are freshly made and full of alcohol not like the watered down versions you get from a stupid machine at other places gotta love the free chips and salsa  the salsa always tastes fresh and theyll give you a superspicy version if you ask and they keep em coming even after dinner if you want more  try the carne asada cheese crisp as an appetizer  it is huge but so good that if you have more than  people at your table you should order two if you dont someones going to wish they had gotten more
