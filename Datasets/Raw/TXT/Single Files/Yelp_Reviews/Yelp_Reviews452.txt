having grown up in north carolina ive had lots of barbecue and i also smoke my own  i feel i can adequately judge the quality of bbq  this particular establishment was unique in that its right off the side of a highway and has drivein microphones and ordering stations straight out of the s  i did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town but not a big deal  i ordered the  barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries  in addition i ordered a minced barbecue sandwich which is the classic barbecue that people would think of when talking about north carolina style bbq     first let me say that foodnetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the s style drivein and for the unique way that the pieces of barbecue chicken are prepared  they are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce  i will say that it is uniqu
