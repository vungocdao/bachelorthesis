though the name of the store has changed over the years this brick and mortar has been around since i was a kid  my grandparents have always referred to it as the ghetto market  lol  what can i say some may feel that the neighborhood is a ghetto  but cest la vie its the neighborhood i grew up in and went to grade school right around the corner  you want a huge store with shiny new lights and fixtures theres frys right down the street     anyhow you simply can not beat their produce prices  in fact if i simply need veg for a dinner ill drive here than go to frys because food city produce beat frys example   food city bananas  lbs for cents   frys bananas  lb for  cents buying food city bananas   savings   pretty sweet
