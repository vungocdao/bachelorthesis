i had not taken my family to rr in quite some time  everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive friday night dinner  pulling in the parking lot i was surprised at the lack of business  that should have been my first clue  we were seated promptly and our drink order was taken  then we waited  and waited  finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken  we ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals  again we waited  our appetizer finally arrived  but no soup  it was mediocre and sadly the best food we would have that evening  our entrees arrived shortly after  it was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup  soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl  it almost looked as though it had been full at one point then dumped out  the fries were cold on all our meals  the burger i ordered well done was extremely pink i did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable  more than halfway through our entrees a gentlemen in what appeared to be a managers uniform came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours  my husband laughed and told him no i already got this half full bowl  a few moments later i bit into something hard like bone in my burger  at that point i was disgusted  and done  i would have told the waitress that the food and service was awful but we were never asked  when she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a  bowl  so my husbands comment must have at least made it back to her yet there was no apology for it nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entruee   for  people lacklusterslow service and terrible food  no thanks rr  we wont be back
