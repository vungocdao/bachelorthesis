im glad i had a deal chicken deal because the food was just ehhh   with my credit of  and a few extra dollars i ordered a full rack of pork ribs which included two sides i chose collared greens  sweet potato fries small upcharge that i was not informed of lb of hot links and a few free dinner buns   the ribs were fairly good  stars albeit a bit dry i guess thats why they drown it in bbq sauce the hot links however were dissssgusting  stars just thinking about it makes me want to puke it was so soft i quickly tossed out the serving that was on my plate and what was left in the container they are what i imagine vienna sausages would taste like but spicy of course   collared greens  sweet potato fries were edible not cringeworthy like the hot links but not worth the caloriesstomach space either   service was friendly  efficient   warning be prepared to swat flies if you dine in there were several on the day i was in ick
