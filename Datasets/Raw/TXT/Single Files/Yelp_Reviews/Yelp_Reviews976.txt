really good lunch spot for takeout the restaurant is divided into takeout and dinein and the dinein portion is relatively small for large groups im a big fan of the classic mozzarella sandwich and vanilla bean rice pudding they dont have much on their menu online but the few items they do have they do really well if you order takeout make sure to call in  minutes before your pick up time so that theyll have it ready otherwise youll be waiting for your takeout   if youre going for a market sandwich i recommend calling in to get their special it can be a hit or miss i got a market sandwich without calling once and ended up with a turkey sloppy joe it had a great taste but extremely messy and oily to eat
