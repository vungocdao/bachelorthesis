after two recent visits here i can honestly say i am torn on my review but overall i know i have had better most recently we arrived shortly after  and were seated indoors because the patio was full and it took our server over  minutes to take our drink order we started off with the spinach artichoke dip and chips which arrived  minutes before our food before i get to the food the appetizer was cold and came with about  chips being there were four of us we asked for some extra chips and some salsa the chips were warm however the salsa stay away unless you like paces from the grocery store really are they kidding serving store bought salsa on to the food  we ordered a good variety stuffed peppers chicken enchiladas burger and chicken sandwich the chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn the enchiladas and peppers were so spicy we had to ask for more water only positive the fries great seasoning as for the service i wish i took her name but our waitress could have given two shabout being there and you could tell no refills never saw her except our order and bill and very blah  not sure we would return anytime soon
