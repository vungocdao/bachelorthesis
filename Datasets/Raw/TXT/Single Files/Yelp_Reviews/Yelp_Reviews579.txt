do not go here had my oil changed on  as i left the lot i pulled out onto university ave and my car immediately died i turned around and headed back to jiffy lube to see what the problem could be as my car was fine prior to the oil change they took my car and said they ran a complete diagnostic test and said that my spark plugs needed to be changed and that my battery was bad they immediately said we have a guy would you like us to call him i felt like i was being scammed how can my car be completely fine prior to the oil change and then after the oil change i now need new spark plugs and possibly a new battery i declined their offer to call their guy and decided to take the chance and drive home   once home i took my car to my local garage which i should have done in the first place and they informed me that jiffy lube failed to put the air filter on correctly after they changed my oil considering all jiffy lube does is change oil i feel placing the air filter on correctly is something they do in their sleep so the so called diagnostic test that they ran was probably a load of bs and all they wanted to do was scam me into having their guy fix my unbroken car which probably would have cost me an arm and leg shame on you jiffy lube just remember someone is more likely to share a bad customer service experience than a good one you can bet i will be sharing this bad one
