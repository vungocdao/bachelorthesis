had my first visit to the saucer a few weeks ago for a trivia night beer selection is awesome and youll find the prices reasonable too menu is great and this cheesehead was very happy to see all the brat menu items including the brat nachos i started with had the chicken cheesesteak for me meal and it was pretty good though the meat to bread ratio favored the bread  as for trivia  they run a tight ship and its a blast the mc is really good and calls out all potential cheaters love it ill be back again soon when im in the university area
