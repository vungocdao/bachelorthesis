i am sorry to have to give the original fish market a  rating i could of given it a  but the service was pretty sad we sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room we waited too long for the waiter to initially great us and there may have only been  diners in the entire restaurant so this is the main reason for a  hopefully its a rarity because the food was pretty good i had the cod sandwich  it was hot and tasty probably one of the better fish sandwiches ive had so it disappoints me to dole out a  but service is important
