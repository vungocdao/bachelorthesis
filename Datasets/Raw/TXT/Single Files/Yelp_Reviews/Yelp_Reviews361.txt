i finally got a chance to eat here thanks to one of my friends very generous christmas gift ive only ever been in for drinks so dinner was a first  we sat in a big booth for just the  of us and i started with the pineapple stoli doli and it is dangerous i could have had like i didnt but i could have we started with the shrimp cocktail and wagyu beef carpaccio both were good   for my entree i had the porcini rubbed delmonico ribeye when it came out it was huge and perfectly cooked we had gotten  sides starting with the lobster mac n cheese which was very good but like my friend said there was nothing that made it omg we also had the onion rings and sauteed spinach which were also good  we had the creme brulee for dessert and that was perfectly lighter than i thought it was going to be and just the right amount of sweetness to finish the dinner  our server was very nice and helped when it came to picking out the wine and his suggestion was great we all enjoyed it
