in the tradition of full disclosure i never really liked quiznos that much anywayim more of a firehouse or harris teeter hoagie guy but the other day i was hungry on lunch and decided to give them a try  the roast beef and cheddar looked pretty good  but it wasnt  it had a weird sort of taste and with every other bite or so i would notice these odd little mushroom bitsyou know like the canned mushrooms and the seasoning and added flavors were not to my liking  not to mention the after effectsugggghnever again quiznosnever again
