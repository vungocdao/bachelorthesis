i have been to this place a few times and enjoyed the flavors however i was very disappointed for their lack of respect to what a customer orders  i order my usual the mee goreng with tofu and as i combed through and had a couple of bites i found a strip of chicken  i lost my appetite and was gravely disappointed by their lack of detail to a vegetarian dish  this place is black listed for me and i hope to find a better malaysian place in the queen city
