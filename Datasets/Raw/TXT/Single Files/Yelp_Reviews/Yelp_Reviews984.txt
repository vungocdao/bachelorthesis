oh king george king of the phoenix dive bars i live so close i require no cars you have pub food of plenty  and patrons a many but consuming such grease makes me feel like a piece your beer doesnt please me and leaves me feeling slightly queasy a dungeon of darkness with lights so dim a place void of nobles and youth most patrons barely have more than a tooth my visits here leave me full of sorrow i guess see you again tomorrow
