the worst customer service by server and manager weve been coming here for years tonights experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences ive ever had supposedly there was a computer error with our food fine i understand it happens sometimes however while waiting two hours we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner we got the same response every time itll be right up he did not consider actually checking on the food all the tables around us came ate and left meanwhile our server could not even remember to bring water to the table without being asked multiple times   after i stopped asking nicely about our food the server finally went to inquire the manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave how generous otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers she did not even follow through on that promise we were given one free beer each pathetic over  of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention people who make it a point to dine here every time we come   the server never apologized nor did he bother to even clear our plates  there are plenty of other places to spend your money where it will be appreciated
