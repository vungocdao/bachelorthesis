i began attending the midwife center for wellwoman care about three years ago then chose the midwife center as my care provider when i became pregnant with my daughter a year and a half ago  i cant say enough good things about this place from the inviting atmosphere to the knowledgeable and supportive midwives to the very helpful nurses and lactation consultant  my daughter was born in the forest room and it was everything id hoped for  one of the saddest parts about leaving pittsburgh for me this past summer when we had to move for my husbands job was having to say goodbye to the midwife center  i am hoping to find someplace half as wonderful in our new city
