replacing an unsuccessful print and framing shop on the corner of th and north davidson tattoo artist and native charlottean joey vernon has put together a shop full of phenomenal artist  with fus custom tattoos that has become one of the busiest businesses in the noda neighborhood in the last year  the noninked can cringe and marvel at the artistry with the window booth on gallery crawls while fans of skin art can get tattooed in the open and social set up throughout the rest of the shop  or they can swing in and scope out the adjacent baku art gallery that houses some of the ink houses artists canvas works beyond the skin  in my thirteen some odd years of being tattooed and having sat for five different artist this is one of the most laid back and social tattoo parlors that i have graced  it makes for a very comfortable setting during what can prove to be a somewhat uncomfortable experience  old school traditional japanese black work et cetera  they have a stable of more than competent artist that can either translate the artwork you bring with you or create a one of a kind piece to last a lifetime  i have sat with matt terry who is insanely good and look forward to having joey work on me in the not too distant future
