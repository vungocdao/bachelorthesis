we just received the worst service ever i will never come back its shocking that on wing special night it was merly  tables one person actually went to the back to fix their own drinks we had to ask for everything numerous of times service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly i personally was not thinking to take pictures of all the screw ups due to all of the complaints the whole table was making i hated to make so many complaints but ive never experienced such horrible service it was awful we couldnt find any positive in it as a matter of fact the waitress didnt even come back to pick up all the checks it was  of us and  ppl got their checks we told the management we needed to pay another check and that we didnt know why the waitress would leave one out his response was unprofessional
