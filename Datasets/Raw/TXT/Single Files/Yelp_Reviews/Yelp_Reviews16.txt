when i think bbb i think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tuneup and a few fixes are long gone      this review is more for the repair end of bbb in their defense bbb does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike ie colnago that you just dont find anywhere else in pittsburgh   at bbb i was charged  for a tune up and a few other things granted this included installing a sew up tire which i can understand would cost approx  swapping out a left side big ring shifter on my down tube this should have cost approx  at most and installing new bar tape cost of tape  and  to install so whats with  for a tune up well the story goes like this  i bring the bike into bbb prior to the nice weather hitting pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my oclv trek  ready for the season turns out i dont hear from these guys a week goes by two weeksi think thats ok i have two or three other bike i can turn to for a ride then i wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure ill get a call from them re my bike is ready to rollbut no dice so i call turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was reinstalling the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out is that my fault he says should be ready in a few days so i come in a few days later to this mammoth bill i ask if i am paying for the labor of taping out the screw i dont think i ever got a straight answer i look at the bill and cant see a good breakdown of the charges normally i would duke it over a bill like this but i figuredi had somewhere i to be  minutes ago and at least i finally have my bike i would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over overhauled but it wasnt  well bbb ill give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great nice wrap plus ill toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles maybe i would have rated bbb higher if i was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair
