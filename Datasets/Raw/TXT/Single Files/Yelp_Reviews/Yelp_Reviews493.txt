we took my wifes sorento into for service on her ac for the first time in march they told us it was her compressor and they replaced it luckily we had a extended warranty and they covered most of it that didnt work so we took it back they said it was a bad control unit and wanted  to replace it i found it online for just over  and i replaced it myself that didnt fix it so we took it back again they said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it they charged us for the replacement but didnt replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit they ordered a warranty replacement and i picked it up much to their disappointment and put it in myself that didnt work either and after spending over  and wasting two plus months with them we took it to dale jarrett kia in monroe they determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time they were able to get kia to warranty two new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out they had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem folger kia has got to be the worse dealership in the charlotte area we spoke directly with kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible folger kia was and how badly they treated us my wife went in when we were finished dealing with folger to get a receipt to give to dale jarrett and mike melton treated her horribly i will never use or recommend folger kia to anyone they are dishonest and their customer service is terrible if you have to use a kia dealer go to dale jarrett it isnt that far but your experience will be so much better
