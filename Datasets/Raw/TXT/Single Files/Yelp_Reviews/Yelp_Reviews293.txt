i havent been to this place  in a very long time years ago this was a regular spot i remembered the room was dark food was good and the infamous pole in the ladys room so on a recent cold winter night while melissa  i were trying to figure out where to eat knowing this is her regular spot i said alexander michaels  parking is always a challenge luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street however the darkness is a little creepy i feel like i need a buddy system to park there find a friend hold hands and walk together like we were in grade school  the embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings we got a table very quickly but thats as much service as we got that night there wasnt any incident the waitress wasnt rude but she just wasnt there for a small place like this it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table    the food was ok as well i ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side i forgot the crab soup was made with fake crab which i think should be illegal to be called crab my sandwich had enough meat on it that i pretty much just ate all the meat which was average tender enough not too much taste to it  i guess for  i couldnt complain years later i felt that their menu was limited a little overpriced and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service  i will give it a nd chance and visit again maybe not anytime soon
