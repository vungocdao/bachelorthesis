im really trying to branch out more into uptownye though i walk through the valley of deathoops i digress  the hubbs and i had a guest in town and he suggested we eat here  i happened to take a chance on this place without consulting yelp and i have to say im glad i again see golden taipei went out on blind faith  i got the ravioli peccasomethingitaliansounding and it was tasty  had those cute broccoli and sundried tomatoesmmm mmm  my husband got some sort of roast beef sammie and the meat was cooked au jus needless to say he was full and happy and our guest joyfully guzzled down some chicken wings because apparently where he lives in west bumble virginia no one makes chicken wings but thats another blasphemy for another day  what makes me a fan is the fullyloaded bar and drink selection  our waitress made a wonderful recommendation based off of how i was feeling libra love crown royal malibu rum pineapple juice and raspberry somethingorothercan you tell it worked and i appreciated how she kept the rounds coming our guest enjoyed jack  coke  the atmosphere was pretty chill and they can cater to larger parties so im already thinking about some type of girls night outing including presto  this would also be a great date night spot reserved for pay day weekends
