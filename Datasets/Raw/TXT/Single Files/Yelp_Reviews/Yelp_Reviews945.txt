if you have a mercedes you need to take it here being new in the area i wasnt sure who to trust i made the mistake of taking it to the dealer for an oil change and came out with a  bill seriously its oil and a filter   i tried this shop and found the owner worked at the dealership for  years before opening his own shop wow nice people and great service he fixed what i needed and recommended a few things the same things firestore mentioned when i took it there for new tires and brakes so i knew it wasnt an up sell i called around and m b motors still had the lowest price m b motors fixed my car in a timely manner and showed me everything they did   their hours are early in the day    so its convenient to drop off before work but a little difficult to pick up nothing that would effect me taking my car there who wants to work on hot cars when its  degrees out  i feel much better now that i have a place to take my benz especially being a single female and not knowing much about cars or what to do
