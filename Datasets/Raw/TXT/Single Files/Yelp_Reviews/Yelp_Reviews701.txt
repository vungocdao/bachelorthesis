ive been to arirang several times now and i have to say that i am not a fan none of the dishes are particularly great and i would even dare to say that most are vastly bland by korean standards my s korean friend really didnt like the beef bulgogi   being that it takes a very long time to get your food and that finding seats for groups larger than  people is nearly impossible i am not likely to return  there are definitely better korean restaurant in the extreme vicinity
