tessaros i kept hearing was the best burger joint in the burgh the award in my opinion is still up in the air i have quite a few more places to check out  a huge plus to tessaros for their kitchen wow is that thing small and the two guys working were rolling the burger patties right through the window ahhh mazing i also heard tessaros butchers their own meat on site i love hearing this   tessaros is definitely worth checking out the lunch crowd gets a bit tight as their tables are close perhaps try a bit before or after the average lunch hour oh and they arent open on sundays so steer clear of that day
