barely ok service was flat out terrible its always bad when your server throws another server under the bus for taking  minutes to get service after sitting downnot impressed service throughout the meal was extremely slow and it took  minutes to just get our food for  people   the food is ok not even close to the best in madison the ribs were very dry and tough the flavor of the rub was good however the bbq sauce on the table was also very good   will not be going back
