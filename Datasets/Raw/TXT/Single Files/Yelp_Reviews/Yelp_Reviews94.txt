clearly should have read a few reviews before going here whenever i go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments i order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits since it was  in the morning i chose not to order primantis   best seller which the waitress told me was beer but perhaps that would have made my experience better as it was i ordered the   best seller the cheese steak it was heinous   think a grimy mechanically separated salisburystyle steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced italian bread served signature primantistyle with coleslaw tomatoes and fries  first the steak was disgusting terrible flavor smelled and tasted like hippie armpit which im not necessarily opposed to as long as its not involved in something im trying to eat with a gross processed meat texture secondly the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich with their old fryer grease taste additionally the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turna trait i dont hold against decenttasting sandwiches but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury   my dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices corned beef and ham  cheese sandwiches respectively easily the best part of the meal was the smallman street fries and those were equally lackluster the bacon was simply bacon bits oh the humanity the chili was uninspired and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries did i mention they tasted like old fryer grease    i will never go back and i will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks primanti bros produces decent food
