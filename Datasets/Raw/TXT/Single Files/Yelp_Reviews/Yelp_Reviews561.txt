i went to cute nails over the weekend it was my third nail salon that i have frequented in the charlotte area this place paled in comparison to the other two it was a decent environment inside the pedicure i got was only  which is a good price as someone else mentioned the water was very hot the chairs are old and not very effective at massaging my chair cut off after about five minutes and would not go back on i am also used to a foot massageleg massage as part of my typical pedicure experience she did not do this but she did punch my feet a few times each that was a little out of what i am used to she did scrape off my dead skin but she did it very lightly and left more skin on than i prefer i am missing some nail polish on the corners of my nails they are also cut kind of crooked my eyebrow waxing experience wasnt so great either she did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner my left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out i dont imagine being back people who worked there were nice though
