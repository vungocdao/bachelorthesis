the sicilian pizza is huge tasty crusty on the outside soft in the middle  the regular thin crust pizza was loaded with toppings  my only complaint is that the pizza was served luke warm  i want my pizza piping hot almost burning the roof of my mouth  the overall taste made up for the temperature difference and i was happy with the overall experience  both the cooks and the waitress were friendly
