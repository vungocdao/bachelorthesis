a few of us hit smoky jons for lunch today  it was insisted that its the best bbq in madison so i was game to try it  the place has character  you order at a window and go take a seat  they bring the food out to you  nothing fancy  paper plates styrofoam cups etc  i got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries  i snarfed a fry to start  not very hot warm id say but tasty  salty  could have been better if fresh but theyll do  the coleslaw was the creamiest ive ever had  the flavor wasnt strong but it was okay  could have used a little salt and pepper  neither to be found  the pork was tasty  definitely smokey  the side of sauce made it however  sweet tangy spicy  while i was eating it i thought yeah its okay  but i wouldnt rave about it  later however thinking back on the meal i thought you know that was really good  while it doesnt best the bbq ive had in memphis it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth id have it again  i think my meal was around  no drink  had a water  i was full and content  mission accomplished  my coworker had some ribs and they looked very good  not too fatty cooked well  i would like to go back and try them sometime  tip  limited seating so show up early or late
