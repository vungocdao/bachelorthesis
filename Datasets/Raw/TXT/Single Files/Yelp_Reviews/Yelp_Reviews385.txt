zero stars for this guy  i called because we had a flood in our home but when the floors were ripped up the water mitigator said we had a problem with our dishwasher and needed to have it checked for leaks  my home warranty company gave me the number to carolina appliance service  i left a message and got a call back right away  when i told the guy my situation he stopped me and said he was not interested in working with me because he was worried that if he did a bad job the insurance company would be coming after him  he actually started an argument with me  i assume he was the owner because he said my company  but my simple question was isnt that what you do  fix dishwasherswhy is this company even on my home warrantys list of providers  he argues so much that i didnt even get to tell him this wasnt part of an insurance claim  so to recapvery rude with obviously no confidence in his own work  dont call these guys
