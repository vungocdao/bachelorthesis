i surmised two things from my visit to thai cuisine  a the competition among thai restaurants must not be very stiff in this town  b yinzers wouldnt know good thai food if it flew into their open mouths  this place was horrible my fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what youd find at a church fishfry insipid overbattered and generally unpleasant my dining partners masaman curry was so sickly sweet it tasted like melted coconut ice cream surprisingly the joint was slammed   on the bright side service was very fast on the downside our waitress was definitely stressed out and cranky possibly from waiting on the top of inebriated coeds across the room from us  the takeaway if youre from pittsburgh youll probably love this place  it was packed with your kinsmen when i was there but if youve enjoyed quality thai food in any large coastal metropolis steer clear  ps food was needlessly pricey given the poor quality
