i recently frequented wild thaiger on a whim based mostly on other yelp reviews and convenience of location i was very pleasantly surprised  although the exterior of the building isnt very nice the patio seating was perfect for this spring day with protection from the sun a casual ambiance and attentive wait staff  the menu is pretty typical although they indicate gluten free items which is very rare for thai restaurants this is super cool and much appreciated as its more difficult for me to intuit ingredients in ethnic cooking  the vegetarian tom ka was brilliant and our curry dish was one of my husbands favorites ever we didnt try any other menu items  i didnt experience the scene inside we were dining on a weekday for lunch so i cant speak to that  all in all a great experience
