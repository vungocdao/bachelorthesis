i am from out of town and have never been to a restaurant at a ball game so i was excited to go to front row to watch the dbacks game the website gave very conflicting messages about when you could purchase the seats in front row for the game so i gave the restaurant a call over a week in advance they said i could only purchase tables the day of i called the night before the game hoping that maybe they would make an exception because i really wanted these tickets i then found out that the tickets have been available all season i asked to speak to the manager who was the rudest human being i have ever spoke to in my life after about an hour on the phone with him tears and being called a liar i decided to hang up and just call customer service i understand that the table i wanted had already been reserved i just wanted the manager lyle to try to help fix the issue he said there was nothing he could do and that everyone knows you can buy the tickets all year round what a piece of crock i cannot believe i was talked to in the way that he spoke to me and i am so thoroughly upset and aggravated at him i just read some previous reviews about him on this site and its so funny that everyone agrees with me if you dont have any issue when you go there then youll be fine but if you have even the slightest complaint that has to go through lyle dont expect to leave happy
