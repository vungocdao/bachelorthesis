i feel like discount or bargain stores like burlington coat factory are a hit or miss sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times you miss out  ive never lucked out here  i give most stores that i see potential the rule of s you miss a truck of new goodies youre between seasons etc bcf well lets just say ive walked in  times and never bought anything not once  i think the big reason ive come away with nothing is the store setup  its so crammed and so messy  bad store planning for the layout and inconsiderate shoppers who make a disgusting mess  i did give an extra star for the staff theyve always been friendly and helpful which always means a lot to me  id rather go anywhere else but bcf  check the sale racks at belk or head to ross before you consider here
