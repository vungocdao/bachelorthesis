went here for a bachelorette party of  girls we had a reservation waited  minutes to be seated was seated a four different tables that we had to asked be pushed together  we then sat at least  minutes before we were greater and our drink order was taken but the drinks took almost  minutes before arriving  when our drinks did arrive the server ran off before taking our dinner order more time passes we order and our food comes out pretty reasonably  minutes  when the food did come out three orders were missing completely our server did not bring our food and was nowhere to be found we sat waiting until finally she came by  at this point weve been here well over an hour  the manager comes by gets the food out says that there would be a free round of drinks for the whole table  i didnt receive the drink promised by the manager and when i asked the server i got a look this was the first and only time i asked her about anything  she brought the drink as i was returning from the restroom and said that an entire bottle of wine would be brought out due to the issues we explained that we had other commitments that it wasnt necessary  then the manager threw in two bottles of champagne at this point im pretty sure he knew that nobody had a great experience and was trying to save face    in the end the manager was great at covering up for the lack of service we received but with so many options in downtown charlotte i would chose another place next time
