i dont know maybe im not clear on the concept of whole foods  dont get me wrong theres nothing really wrong with shopping at whole foods  whole foods does have wonderful merchandise but  i have found that i can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at giant eagle for less  thier wine and beer selection supposedly quite remarkable in other states well remember this is pennsylvania  you cant buy those things at the grocery store    i can get just as good quality meat and produce in the strip district  sometimes even better quality  i guess the benefit of whole foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and dont have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores  im not slamming whole foods at all but i actually like trader joes better
