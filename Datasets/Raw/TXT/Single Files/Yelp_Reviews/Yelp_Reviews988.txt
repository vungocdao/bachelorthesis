i dont know why others had such a problem with the owner petey i went in for the first time last weekend and he was just fine perhaps its because ive learned over the years how to communicate to boutique shop owners that im not just looking but im on a hunt for the perfect fucking end tables and i hate chrome  you would be surprised how far that approach goes at any place tell the owner what you like and dont like right away letting them know you have an opinion allows them to engage with you as someone who appreciates desig
