its got its ups and downs  its got a reasonably attractive interior antique tin ceilings a broad selection of dozens of beers and a tasty looking menu featuring daily specials  so why my low score  ds at the other end of the block puts their beer collection to shame offering  beers  both times ive eaten here the wait to be served has been extremely slow at least  minutes and up the prices are a bit high  for a lunch entree and most importantly the food is in general heavy and bland  this is not a terrible place but with so many delicious spots nearby in regent square like the green mango map room ds and the square cafe you should keep on walking  that said if you wanted a quiet spot to grab a beer with a friend you could definitely do worse but skip the boring food
