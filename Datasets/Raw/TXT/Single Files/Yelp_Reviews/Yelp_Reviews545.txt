i met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great chain or otherwise the food was blah first we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten which they sort of honored at least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived  our waitress was the only shining star  she did a good job of taking care of  people with  separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled she was also helpful in getting a couple of the tvs switched over to the panthers game they lost  we had a few appetizers for the table the pretzel bones were good served with a couple of different sauces as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces if you like cheese fries try the fire stix which were the best part of the meal  having read the reviews i knew to stay away from the brisket i went with a lunch sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast it was dry and not much more than warm after we asked the waitress brought out the bbq sauces which improved the bland taste the fire roasted corn was good  a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty the mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well especially when i mixed it with the corn
