it wasnt bad but it definitely wasnt good   as soon as we walked in the door the place was jammed back with people who were not interested in seating anyone or telling anyone they would be seated on one side of the restaurant there were literally two girls working and one of them was pregnant you can imagine the chaos i wanted to have this pittsburgh experience that ive heard so much about but honestly i was more than underwhelmed   after being seated it took the waitress  minutes to get around to actually saying hello to us and in between that time a large group of people decided to squeeze in a booth behind our table making my friend having to get up every time a waitress or another person needed to squeeze back there  the sandwich at best was mediocre the coleslaw was a bit too vinegary for my tastes and became sickening after the first half of the sandwich i needed a lot of ketchup to even finish the sandwich not to mention i got a nice souvenier of vinegary smelling hands afterwards   if youre a tourist go do it to say you had a colossal sandwich and lived the pittsburgh experience apart from that i dont know why youd return
