phoenix has a large but scattered population im not sure why developers picked this location for a chinese culture center  it doesnt make sense to me as the area around dobson might seem more appropriate  the center seems like itd have potential if it gave incentive for small businesses to set up shop and stay  ive heard the lunar festival held here charged admission and was dismal  its now not much more than a nearlyempty strip mall with asian architecture  i live up the street and would rather drive to mesachandler for anything asian sad because i hoped phoenix could do better
