our last few visits have left something to desire one of the things i always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees these people look miserable no one smiles or greets you appropriately its more like get in get out turn the tables  the food has remained consistently good when we can order it the last time jb and i came for a quick dinner the place was not busy yet we were passed by  frowning waitstaff without getting drinks for  minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table hint hint so we left and most likely will not be returning
