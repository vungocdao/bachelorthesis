i will not return terrible customer service i ordered a pizza from here because i had received a welcome packet with some coupons including one for demarcos giving a free large  topping pizza dine in or take out i called and ordered then went to pick it up upon doing so the hostess told me the owner wasnt accepting these coupons and its only good with a  or something purchase the coupon was newly received so this wasnt news to the owner he just didnt pull them per the hostess which seems like a scam to me i politely argued with the girl telling her it doesnt give stipulations anywhere and thats false advertising not even sure if thats legal and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers like myself she understood but it was the owners call i ended up purchasing the pizza needed to eat and the pizza wasnt good it had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt because im pregnant i opted not to get too stressed so after stating my views i left vowing that i wont return which is unfortunate because its very close to my home but there are too many other places close enough with better food and certainly better service
