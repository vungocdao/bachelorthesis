worst experience with a hairdresser ever at this location made an appointment with diane for a body wave when i was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said you get body waves yeah thats why i booked one at your salon then she argued with me about when to trim i wanted after she wanted before and after five minutes acknowledged that it didnt matter but first telling me the perm wouldnt soak in on the ends unless she trimmed it then she argued with me about the rods its taken me over ten years to figure out with aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is diane knew better but finally agreed then she proceeded to comb my wet hair from the forehead back scratching my scalp and jerking my head that wasnt enough though she then started rolling it with the rods she thought i should have  i got up and left when i addressed the problem at the front no effort was made to help me other than to offer coming back and talking to the owner yeah right thats gonna happen horrible salondirty also just as a side note
