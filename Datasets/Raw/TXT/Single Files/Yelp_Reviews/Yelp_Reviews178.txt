i just dont understand the appeal  ive tried this place twice thinking that i somehow had a lemon of a burger the first time  and then returned a few months later  nope  the smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh but where the hell is the flavor  i can go as far as saying that i dont believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper  if i closed my eyes it is possible that i wouldnt even know that it was a hamburger  that is embarrassing  maybe if youre used to eating  cent burgers sysco meat or at chain restaurants then you would find this to be amazing  ive had some of the best burgers at many cities in the us and this is an embarrassment to pittsburgh  go to brgr if you want a tasty burger near bloomfield  on the other end of the spectrum were the sides the sides were classics but definitely above average especially the home fries  i would consider a  star rating if it werent for them  additionally the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend the decor is old school and seems satisfied in its current state  just like the food itself  file this one under legacy restaurant still living on its past accolades
