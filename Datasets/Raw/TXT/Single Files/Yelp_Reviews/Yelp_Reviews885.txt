for this pinche gringo this place rocks  its a very festive place to both shop and dine their food offerings through their cafe or whatever they call it is endless  its a great spot to grab a cheap lunch they are usually busy so allow yourself  minutes between ordering and actually eating  their agua frescos are delicious i recommend the melon its sweetened cantaloupe puree served on ice there are little melon chunkies small enough to slurp through a straw  of all the food ive had there it was good carnitas carne asada gorditas etc  so if you want to immerse yourself in good food and some lively people take a drive down to ranch market
