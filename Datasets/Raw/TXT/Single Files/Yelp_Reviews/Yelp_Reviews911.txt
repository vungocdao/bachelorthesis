stayed here for a long weekend for a friends wedding in mesa driving from southern california it was located conveniently near the freeway and parking was easy check in was a breeze the receptionist was very friendly he gave us two warm cookies and a map of the surrounding area to help us out looks a bit outdated from the outside but dont judge a book by the cover the rooms are definitely kept up very nicely the room was so spacious upon entering there is a couch that turns into a bed with a desk that was convenient when we ordered pizza and ate around it there is a microwave large fridge and everything was so clean the separate room was nice with a king bed that was large and comfy and had nice closet space to hang our clothes for the wedding we went to the belvedere restaurant downstairs on the first night to grab some drinks and the drinks were very overpriced but i guess thats expected for a hotel bar we loved everything about the hotel especially the complimentary breakfast located in the restaurant buffett style with a different main entree that differed everyday like french toast pancakes and waffles with sausage bacon yogurt pastries and coffee would definitely recommend staying here and will plan on returning to this hotel once baseball spring training comes around for my dodgers
