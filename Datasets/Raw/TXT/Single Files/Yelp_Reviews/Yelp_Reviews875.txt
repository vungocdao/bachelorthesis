this has to be the most ghetto and disrespectful dive ive ever been to i usually dont play the race card but unless you are a spanish speaking latino you will not be treated well by the staff  as soon as i walked up to the counter a pregnant cashier rolled her eyes and asked dully what i wanted i couldnt pronounce the name of the combo i wanted but i blurted out the number associated with it and it had a picture she looked over her shoulder at one of her associates and said something the only words i caught were token gringo customer  they shared a giggle  they were speaking in that halfassed spanish that has a little english mixed in suffice it to say i was offended and promptly cancelled the order i have not returned since then
