overall a decent yet confusing experience pros its like living in an apt because its spacious and has a kitchen and laundry room downstairs theres even free laundry soap available in the laundry room its located next to a lot of restaurants and shops some of the staff has been friendly in providing things including shuttle rides cons extremely inconsistent room cleaning service if youre staying for an extended period of time they only clean your room once a week on an assigned day the problem is they dont show on the assigned day to clean my roommate and i have ended up calling the office sometimes twice before its cleaned also someone in our  building had  stolen out of her drawer and the management told her not to call the cops they ended up cutting her check but not before a lot of stern talk i wouldnt stay here againif you do make sure that you use the safe provided in the room and expect to do a lot of the maid services yourself
