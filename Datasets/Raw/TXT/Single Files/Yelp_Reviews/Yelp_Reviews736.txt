so dominos is dominos right  you must know what you are gettingi dont have to tell you the pizza breadsticks chicken strips pretty good in terms of getting what you pay for  however this location gets the unfortunate privilege  of being my neighborhood locations less than a mile from my house and although this location has been prompt and delicious this is more a review about the man himself mr domino and my online ordering experiences with him  my friends why would you spend  on a dominos pizza when papa johns will give it to you for   not to say im a broke hobo but seriously the difference in cost is a draft beer at a classy joint and  at the places i frequent  my biggest irk with dominos is that they advertise  any speciality pizza and if you change  item say you dont like mushrooms not saying thats me could be not saying and trade for something like black olives even trade no  sometimes i even end up with less on the pizza because i dont like meats all that much and substitute veggies  so if you change  item instead of their  advertised special all of a sudden the price is    for some fin black olives  seriously  i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed  about the rd time this happened i finally put my foot down and looked up papa johns website   any pizza up to  toppings any toppings  pretty much my bff  pjs  go for it
