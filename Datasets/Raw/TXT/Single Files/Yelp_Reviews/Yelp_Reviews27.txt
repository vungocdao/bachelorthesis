our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address he was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep we went to the arl and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia she said in the most uncaring apathetic voice possible we were heartbroken of course go wait by that door and someone will meet you after a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier ill bring your carrier back out in a minute we said no thats okay keep the carrier she said okay and took our cat to the back and that was it no kind words no sympathetic gestures no would you like a moment before i take him no im sorry nothing for us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the arl seemed to care or at least have been trained to pretend to care one bit   they get a couple stars for offering a necessary service but other than that this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy
