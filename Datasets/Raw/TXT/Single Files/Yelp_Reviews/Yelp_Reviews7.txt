ok let me tell you about my bad experience first i went to db last night for a post wedding party  which side note is a great idea  it was around midnight and the bar wasnt really populated there were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything the two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at kind of counter productive if you ask me   i stood there for about  minutes which for a busy bar is fine but when i am the only one with my card out then it just seems a little ridiculous i made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away i finally had to walk to them to get their attention  i was standing right in front of them smiling and they didnt ask if i need anything i finally said are you working and they gave each other a weird look i felt like i was the crazy one i asked for a beergot the beer  in between that time the other bartender brought food over and set it down she took a fry from the plate right in front of me and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar what the hell i felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks  not an established db   i was just really turned off from that experience   the good is that db provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up i remember going here with my grandparents when i was a kid and it was the best treat ever we would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games this place holds some really good memories for me   its a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards i held for it
