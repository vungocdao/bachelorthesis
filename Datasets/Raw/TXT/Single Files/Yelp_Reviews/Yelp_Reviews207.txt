just way to expensive for what it is its good but not at the prices they choose  for wedding soup it was good but not at that price and if i wouldve been told it was that much was a special i wouldve passed service was fine but not attentive and slow as well just so many other good italian places in the area for half the price eggplant parm was enjoyable
