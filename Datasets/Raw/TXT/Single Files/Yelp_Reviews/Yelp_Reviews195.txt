i have tasted the best pizza in the us pepes new haven ct and i have tasted a whole bunch of bad pizza and a whole bunch in the middle  i am coming to the conclusion that pizza is a very personal thing to people who love it like i do  after years of people telling me to go here we finally stopped on our way home from my sons hockey game at noon on saturday  service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do  no one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order  but after we figured it out everything was good  we ordered a large pie  cheese and  cheese and sausage  the crust is very good and some of the best tasting i have had in some time  it actually had a taste to it not just a bread taste  after that everything else is what i consider the personal taste part  the sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me  i dont know if they used provolone i should have asked but it gave the pizza a funny taste to me  i wont be going back just because my personal taste
