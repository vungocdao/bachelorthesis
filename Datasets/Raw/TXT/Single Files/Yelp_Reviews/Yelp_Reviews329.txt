ok so i finally dined here and lets say disappointing wasnt even the wordif im going to be dropping a large sum of money down i want it to be on food that i actually enjoyed   i went a few weeks ago and we opted for the three course chefs tasting menuwell lets just say if these dishes were a reflection of any chef well they truly shouldnt be one right down to the presentations   for my first course i had the baked beans as we called it not at all what i expected to get and  barely any duck confit in it as it said on the menu very boring and missing lots of flavors so yes they tasted and looked like baked beans then second course i had the tomato with goat cheese and peas i had one bite and did not go back for another the plate was filled with tomato liquid and the goat cheese was running right in it  yuck is all i have to say then finally our last course my favorite is rack of lamb so of course im now anticipating my lamb i had asked for it to be cooked raremedium rare just in case they were to over cook it well sure enough it came out medium wellnow i would have sent it back but my friend had ordered his steak medium well and got his rare so i didnt want to be that table that sent everything back  only good thing about this place was my company it is outdated they may want to rethink theyre concept again and possibly add a few woman servers in there to bring some life to this place finally this place was stale like the bread
