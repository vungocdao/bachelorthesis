ive driven past this place many times on the way to suns or dbacks games  every time i passed by it looked like a fun place to go hang out  i finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown phoenix  one of the companies at the conference hosted a party here  the party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant  the company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary cigars so i understand why they had it outdoors  the weather was perfect so it was a good time of the year to do it  the place was packed too  so why the  stars  heres why   they serve wine out of a liquor gunyes they do  when i went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of cabernet the bartender told me you have to go inside because we dont have the handles with the winei thought she was kidding and i said im sorry i dont think you understand i asked for a glass of cabernet  you dont have any bottles back therethats when she confirmed what i heard and said no you heard me right we serve wine out of a handleline and since were a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get itwhat the hell  the wine tasted like what you would expect wine from a tap to taste like   the restrooms are like gas station restrooms  theyre located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that theyre too small and dirty  they couldnt handle the crowd of people at the party   service is slow  the line at the bar was  people deep for each line  lines  there were only  bartenders to service  people  it took  min to get a drink   the party felt like a house party in someones backyard  plastic cups plastic furniture you had to bus your own tablethere were no buspersons or anyone to clean up  bizzaroworld  overall not a good experience  maybe if i was a young  yr old it would be coolnot now  return factor
