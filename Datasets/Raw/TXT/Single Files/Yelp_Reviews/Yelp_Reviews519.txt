so bad compelled me to download yelp app and write review went for lunch with family wife and  young boys weve learned to not be picky as our crew can be a little rambunctious first off in an empty restaurant we were seated directly next to the kitchen inout door next the waitress spilled water on my wife and table then when asked what the specials were i was told um not sure let me check my food turkey club was eatable but my wife salad consisted of brown lettuce the kicker is that my boys  and  didnt eat their hotdogs because they tasty yucky how can you mess up a hot dog  seems to be a good place to grab a beer and watch a game just dont eat
