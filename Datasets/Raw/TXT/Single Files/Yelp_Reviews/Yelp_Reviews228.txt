harris grill was long one of my favorite spots to goto just about any night of the week  however its changed in recent months and i dont think i will return  on a recent thursday night my friend and i had possibly the worst waitress ever  her name was amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress  she was not present for about  minutes after we were sat  she finally appeared and asked us for our drink order she disappeared for about  minutes before returning  she served us our drinks then immediately left for another table it was another  to  minutes before she came by again this time taking our order for food  she return  minutes later with another round of drinks which we dont remember ordering but we werent going to complain we never saw her the rest of the night  other waitresses were making their rounds every  minutes out on the patio but ours never appeared once  i thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition  i even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay  she said they would check  she returned not long after and said she was alright  i relaxed a little until another  minutes went by it was now about  minutes since we had ordered and no food  we waited a bit longer we still hadnt seen amanda our waitress for those paying attention  an hour went by and we had had enough i really couldnt believe this  not only did we not have our food but we hadnt seen our waitress in an hour  an hour  what the hell
