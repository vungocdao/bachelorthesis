last summer i had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time i also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on they fixed it for free and the very next morning i had the same issue i called to complain and the manager didnt even apologize so frustrated never going back  they seem overpriced too
