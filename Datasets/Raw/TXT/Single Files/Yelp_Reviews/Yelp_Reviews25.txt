as a chinese american college student from nyc who got stuck in pittsburgh with its useless public transportation circa  i desperately missed homestyle chinese food for the better part of my first two years here things turned around for me once i got a car or made friends with cars but i was seriously hurting for a while  tasty was one of the places we found back in the day it was owned and ran by a typical restaurantowning chinese family they had the works  pushy lao ban niang boss lady chef slash dad and during school offhours junior high school daughter manning the cashier if they were in nyc theyd only be missing an ami a bus boy the food was pretty good and if you order in chinese the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because your parents teach you good to talk chineees   im pretty sure tasty is under new ownership now the food isnt as good as it was but the restaurant still gives off the homestyle look and feel its a small restaurant with enough seating for about  patrons cheap tables cheap seat
