i have seen quite a few games  concerts at us airways center and now having the light rail it makes getting into and out of downtown phoenix so much easier plus with a game ticket you can ride for free up to  hours before to  hours after the event for free and the train stops are walking distance from the arena  never a bad time at us airways center
