this should say it all we found a dress we loved it was in our price range butwe didnt return because of the customer service  i suppose we could have gotten over it to get the dress but we just didnt want that negative experience to taint our wedding it was all going so well too the people helping us were very down to earth very accommodating and helpful patient and knowledgeable but when we told them that we werent ready to buy the dress it was like jekyll and hyde and we were given attitude and a cold shoulder were talking passiveaggressive teenagerlike behavior let me be clear  we didnt say no we didnt say we were going to go somewhere else  all we said was that we werent ready in all likelihood we were going to be back in a couple weeks and buy and just wanted to think about it one more time its a purchase that costs thousands of dollar
