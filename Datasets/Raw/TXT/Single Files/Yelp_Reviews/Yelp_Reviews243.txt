i am a nice amicable person i treat others with kindness and have a highly positive attitude i rarely complain about things thus it makes me sad to write a negative review however the way in which mozart management staff have behaved and conducted themselves over the past two years warrants this review we moved to pittsburgh when i was in graduate school we loved our tiny cute apartment at schenley arms our first home as a couple this abruptly changed when simple calls to request that they salt the driveway were met with aggression irritability and statements such as we have never had a complaint before and we cannot accommodate your schedule i felt guilty at first about calling but then had an epiphany and realized that mozart has serious issues the tone of their written  correspondence is also highly intimidating demeaning and threatening i will not bore you with the additional myriad of complaints that exist what ever happened to customer service decency and basic regard for other human beings            if you value your hard earned money and do not want to be met with criticism and hostility when interacting with your landlordavoid at all costs also there are a fair amount of negative reviews when you do a search on googleread and believe them they are completely mean and disrespectful this is not the kind of business i want to support as it conflicts with my value system we are moving out asap when our lease expires   ps the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve  stars i hope they arent treated as bad as the tenants
