the store reeks of rotting fish the security guards watch you like a hawk and the food selection is the worse ive seen in any giant eagle in the city  one plus if you must shop here there are plenty of jitney drivers waiting for you to come out to offer you a ride  that can be a big help if you are like me and dont have a car need a car haha some things about living in the hood just never change   with this being the closet g e to downtown and pnc park and heinz field i would think they would renovate but its been years and still no change
