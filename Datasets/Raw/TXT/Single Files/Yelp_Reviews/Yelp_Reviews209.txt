i came here craving some sushi  looked up the best reviewed sushi place in my area and found this little restaurant  i was excited at the front because it was a small restaurant and i love supporting small mom and pops    i figured this may be a little diamond in the rough  man was i wrong  the sushi was not fresh  the sushi wasnt rolled tight either  the rice didnt have the trademark sushi rice flavor   spoiled by the fresh ingredients and catches of california i felt like the ingredients were sort of old  considering i went in on a saturday i figured it might be better but it wasnt at all  the service was good  thats the justification for the  stars  otherwise i really wouldnt recommend this place to other people
