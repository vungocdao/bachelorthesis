i have lived here my whole life  and for most of that time i have pretty much eaten gringocized mexican food  you know ajo als macayos garcias etc  at this point it is still a treat for me but i would rather eat at the authentic mexican dive with actual spanish on the menu dishes i dont recognize and very few white people in the place  el nopalito fits the bill perfectly  this place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on chowhound  it was right in my neighborhood but i never got around to trying it until last week   we showed up on a friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and sadly laying off employees  ick  we started with two cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa  both salsas were outstanding which in my experience is rare  generally if you get two salsas on the table one is terrible and one is at least decent  and mexican cokes in the cool bottles  yay  then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share  this was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy  we only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one  generous  the only room for improvement was temperature  the soup could have been hotter  next we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas andandand i forgot the name of my entree  it was however the servers recommendation and she didnt let me down  my dish was steak with bacon green peppers onions and cheese melted over the top  all of this was served over two corn tortillas  super good  everything was cooked to perfection  the green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had  the rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well  i had the leftover enchiladas today for lunch and they were awesome all over again  well be back to el nopalito often  im excited to try the  cent street tacos
