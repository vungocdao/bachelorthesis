not sure why this location has received so many bad reviews i used to work directly across the street from this location and would go here for lunch at least  times a week i still make it down there occasionally since i no longer work in phoenix the owner and his wife are always so sweet and chatty they remind me so much of my grandparents i compare all schlotzkys to this one and most fail in comparison  my favorite sandwich to this day is the albuquerque turkey with lots of their hot sauce now my mouth is watering as far as poor choice of sides go good luck finding a franchise sandwich shop that serves fries i prefer chips with my sandwich anyways anyhoo if you are in the area around lunch time be prepared for a line but it goes quick
