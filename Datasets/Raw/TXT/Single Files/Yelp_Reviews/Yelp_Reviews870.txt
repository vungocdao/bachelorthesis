being from southern california the scene is so much fun there are several clubs to go to and any night is a great time that brings us to the phoenix scene and the cashoh wait there is no scene for the ladies not going to bash them to hard because its the only consistent place that we have yes it caters to the country music crowd but they do play spurts of other music through out the weekend eveningsthe mixed drinks could be better but the prices are reasonable
