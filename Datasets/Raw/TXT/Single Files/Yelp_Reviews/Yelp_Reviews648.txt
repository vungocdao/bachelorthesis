horrible service inedible food tremendous swivel factor but my drink was fine  their advertised drink specials are good but most concentrated on shots and lowend liquors think smirnoff for  the service at the bar was hard to come by although there were at least two bartenders working  i asked for a minute with the menu and spent the next  minutes trying to flag down a bartender to take my food order  ordered the shrimp special which was not very special at all  although there were  grilled shrimp that were actually pretty good the rest of the plate was a mess of flavorless watery rice pilaf and a virtual stalk of broccoli steamed but otherwise unadorned  at  it was definitely not a good value  plus it took forever to arrive the gentleman next to me ordered the meatloaf special and his cafeteriastyle serving arrived in about  seconds  that didnt make me very happy for him however as it looked equally disgusting  i cannot recommed this place for anything other than a drink although the pool players seemed to be having a good time
