what a find i found this place thank to my trusty yelp app i wanted some good spicy mexican food and rositas place seemed to fit the bill in all honesty i was planning to go to los dos molinos but they are closed on sundays  you park behind the restaurant and walk around the front dodging a few cars along the way walking in i loved the atmosphere it was bustling and full of life but not overwhelmingly busy we were seated at a table just past the indoor fish pondhmmm the service was prompt the chips and salsa came right out the salsaoh the salsa it is delish full of flavor and lots of heat but in a good way i ordered the chicken enchilada plate one red and one green my companion ordered the green chili tamale plate out of this world good they arrived glowing hot the plates and food were so heat hot we could not start eating for about  minutes which allowed us to enjoy the ice cold beer  once the food finally cooled to a manageable temperature it was amazing the flavors were spot on the chicken was super moist and each sauce was great the refried beans here are like crack i was so full but could not stop eating them yum  im pretty sure i have found my goto mexican spot in phoenix
