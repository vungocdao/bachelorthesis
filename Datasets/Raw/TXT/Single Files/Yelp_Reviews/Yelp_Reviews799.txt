used a groupon special for the murder mystery evening with tickets to the show and dinner the murder mystery show was in a room about  x  feet with  people crowded into this space the volume of the music and announcements were so loud we couldnt even talk to half the people at out table they took our drink order and we didnt see it until half an hour later the food was horrible how can you ruin a spaghetti dinnerfirst of all it was cold cold spaghetti  hardly any sauce the house salad was taken out of a plastic bag and dumped into a bowlat an italian place they served the salad with only ranch dressing  not even italian and no choices offered  our party of four will not go back at least  others felt the same way
