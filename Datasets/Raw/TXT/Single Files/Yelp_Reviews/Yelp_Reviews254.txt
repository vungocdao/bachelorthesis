our wedding cake and dessert table vendor was included in our reception package so im sure the owners are going to say we didnt pay them directly so what i write doesnt matter ive seen this response in other negative reviews  in my opinion that should not matter  we should still receive the same type of respect courtesy and professionalism that all clients should receive  this was not the case  i wont rewrite what i posted last year about our issues with the dessert table and the attitude of linda but what i am posting about now is our  year anniversary cake top  we were given a certificate in our package for a free fresh cake made in our wedding cake flavors  linda even wrote the flavors on the card  i was really excited to taste the cake since my husband and i didnt really get a chance to during our reception  they gave us a plain chocolate cake with white icing  this is not what our wedding cake was  when i called and asked if there was a mistake i was told someone would call me back  of course they didnt  so i called again and spoke with steve who laughed at me when i asked why we didnt receive a cake in our wedding flavors and then had the audacity to say well you got a free cake  really  it wasnt good and it was a plain cake i could have made myself  when i said thats not the point he said what do you want me to do  another cake fine  when do you want to pick it up  when we picked up the second cake again in was the same cake as before  i have yet to try my own wedding cake flavor  they are so rude cocky and ignorant  i will never go to the bakery again nor will i ever recommend it to anyone else
