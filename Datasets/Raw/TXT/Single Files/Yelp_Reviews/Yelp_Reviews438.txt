this review is solely based on my experience in the prayer room it is upstairs tucked into a quiet corner with very little foot traffic which means no interruptions the chapel as it is called is interfaith and contains a quranbible and torah available there are also prayer mats for muslims and an altar to kneel at i believe they also have have sacrament available for communion but you need to contact staff  being muslim i really appreciated the quiet serenity to be able to pray without feeling rushed to do so i used the room twice upon arrival an departure when praying the second time around i was joined by a catholic gentleman so the room does get use thank you cd airport for a blessing to passengers needing a place to pray and worship
