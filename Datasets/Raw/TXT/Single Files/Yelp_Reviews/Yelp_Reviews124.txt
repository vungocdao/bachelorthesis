the location of redfin blues is great it overlooks the river and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks however the food and service is sub par each time that i have been here whether it be an extremely bustling saturday evening or a slow weekday afternoon the service has been poor the food is average and is way overpriced there are many other great places in pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich   redfin blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant but with the poor service and average food it has a lot to yearn for
