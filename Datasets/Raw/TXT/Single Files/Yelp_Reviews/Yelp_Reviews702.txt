legendarily lame  this place has managed to successfully wage a campaign against fun for more than a decade tactics include carefully measuring out each shot with a measuring cup while making mixed drinks and charging four dollars above market price for shitty food  going to legends is like having the hot water cut out in the middle of a shower  its like getting your scrotum caught while zipping up your fly  its like watching schindlers list during a bachelor party  its like clogging the toilet at your girlfriends parents house   not fun at all
