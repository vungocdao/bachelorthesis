harsh to say but i hate arenas the only time i go is to see s concert show or special event as im not an arenatype sports fan last nights event was cirque du soleils michael jacksonthe immortal tour i have to say as far as arenas go the us airways center is pretty amazing  entering and exiting are easypeasy it didnt feel overly crowded and parking was plentiful in outdoor lots or the adjacent indoor multistory connected building    theres a starbucks on site which was like heaven to me    i wanted a nice hot tea to savor through the show there are other wellknown food concessions throughout the arena as well as some fairly comfortable seating areas to pass the time until the powers that be allow you to go to your seat  since we were sitting in section  first row we were in the makeshift seats the same as they put on the floor foldables with no real back support  this was probably the only negative for me as after about an hour my lower back was killing me and i still feel it this morning  but    the seats were wonderful for viewing the show  couldnt have been better    sound quality was what youd expect in an arena not built specifically for music so i didnt have high expectations   i have to say that i am very impressed by the us airways center and all the nightmare worries that i had about entering the building exiting the building finding something i wanted to drink and of course parking were something i didnt have to be anxious about at all  bravo
