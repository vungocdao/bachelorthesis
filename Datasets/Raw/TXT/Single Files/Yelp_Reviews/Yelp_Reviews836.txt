went here while in phx on business with a friend who lives locally  thought it would be a good place to have some dinner since i love bbq  no such luck  nothing seemed like real bbq  just over cooked and tasteless  very chain resturanty  cool memorabilia abut thats about it  they only give a small cup of bbq sauce for your meal  i dont reccommend
