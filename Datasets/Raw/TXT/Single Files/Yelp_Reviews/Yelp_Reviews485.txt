glad we tried this at restaurant week prices  didnt realize it was  a corporate place until we got our leftovers in  a bag advertising the network of places it was part of  we had just said the food was decent but soulless like youd expect of a corporate restaurant when that bag arrived to our oh that explains it typical south side snob crap  high prices and low quality and originality  for people who want to be seen and spend alot and have the palettes of a  year old  for more of the same you can buy  olive oil thats really canola at  dean and deluca next door   like the reviewer here  with one unsalted and one over salted selection i will add that the duck was under cooked and the salmon over cooked disappointing
