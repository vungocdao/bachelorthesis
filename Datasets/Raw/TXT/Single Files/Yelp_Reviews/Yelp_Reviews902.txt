at the dbgs for the first time ever a couple of months ago to check out the venue for my daughters wedding from the very beginning amber that young lady who worked with us was professional on the ball and organizedfar more than i can say about the wedding planner i believe she must be the parks event coordinator and totally rocked it   the place is truly beautiful so different from what a traditional garden looks like read the other reviews and the other folks will give you a much better idea of the type of plants bugs small animals or as my granddaughter loudly proclaimed  the birds with the hats   there were four other wedding going on the afternoon  but we never really heard much except for some far away music signs were clearly posted leading the way to the wedding site and the rehearsal the night before and the restrooms were exceptionally clean and pleasant to use   there was a very large room with shuttered windows and ac where my daughter and her wedding party dressed and a smaller similar room where the groom and his group readied themselves after the wedding as the chairs and such were put away the entire group came back to the same area which is a small courtyard and had a cocktail hour   my daughter and her husband were married in the far back arena where they have the outdoor concerts and therein lies the only reason this wonderful place does not get five stars   if you have your wedding at this particular site park your car in the dirt lot that is adjacent to the unloading area it is the first right as you come into the park and has a sign posted that reads service area only i understand that during the afternoon the park may want you to stroll leisurely through the park enjoying the natural beauty of the place but at the end of a very long day it wouldve been so much better to park in back and take a  min walk as opposed to an agonizing  min stroll  it was incredibly hard for some of the older folks in the group making their way back to the cars and by the time the wedding ended it was late and the only rangers we saw were on our way out   it was also very dark there and the lights on the canopy over the wedding table did not come on for a long time but eventually they did and it was truly breathtaking you may want to have someone be the on the watch for this so the wedding party doesnt eat in the dark lovely place to have a party or wedding parking not so great   thank you dbg for making my daughters wedding so very memorable
