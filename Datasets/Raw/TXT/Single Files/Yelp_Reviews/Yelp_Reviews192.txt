cute place i went here after a kickball game with some of my team members  the staff were fantastic  i called to make a reservation and they were very nice  they also called back to make sure it was ok for us to sit in the bar    upon arrival the bartender was very pleasant  she showed me to the table which was marked reserved    she took drink orders then food orders  my guests said the food was good but i didnt have anything  there are tvs all around the bar and some games to play as well  this is a little gem in the south hills
