the people who work here are very rude i have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person but no it happen every time i am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there it is like you are walking into someones house and bothering them the people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation plus it is very dirty perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other i will not go back again
