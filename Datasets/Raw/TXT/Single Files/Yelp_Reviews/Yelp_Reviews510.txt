i have lived near here for two years and always wanted to stop in for breakfast or lunch they dont do dinner the waitresses were very friendly and you could tell that most of the people in here were regulars bc they were all being called by name  nice touch   i ordered coffee black two eggs country ham with biscuit and grits the food came out in about  minutes and it was freshly cooked and hot the menu said their eggs are farm raised but did not ask if they were local the coffee was refilled often and they also brought out a huge glass of ice water   i love places like this look bad from the outside inside it has white and black checkered floors with red vinyl seats no frills but the food was very good   price was right too i will go back
