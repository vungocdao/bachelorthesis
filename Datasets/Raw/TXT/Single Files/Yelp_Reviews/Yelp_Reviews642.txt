yes i am reviewing a starbucks  the reason for this review was for the exceptional service i received here this past weekend  my wife has been saving the points up on her starbucks rewards card a gold card it turns out that you have to cash in free drinks within  days on your card now and they can not be stored and used when ever you like so instead of have multiple free drinks on her card for us to use we only had  free one the employee at the counter explained this new rule to us and still hooked us up with a second free drink any size any kind of our choice  it was truly awesome customer service so thank you lady employee behind the register this last easter sunday around noon  other things i noticed about this starbucks it was very clean a well organized pastrymuffin area there is no drive thru so that kinda sucks i counted at least  people working behind the counter so staffed properly our drinks were made quick and tasted great   out of  only because it is a starbucks and there are just so many of them its not original  again excellent customer service
