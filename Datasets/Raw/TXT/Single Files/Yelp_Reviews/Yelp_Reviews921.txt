the only reason they dont get  star is because i understand they arent accustomed to the heavier side of music and prolly panicked a bit when the bad brains came through  that said this place bites  they blocked off half the seating oversold the show and then were kicking people out for standing  it was a punk rock show following an am skate competition they were cutting people off that werent anywhere close to obliterated   the bathroom situation is chaos  the bouncers who usually work shows like barry manalow were acting like they were hells angels roughing up little kids trying to mosh and in the end pissed off the band  just to get into the place required every punk kid to remove every last bit of metal  their punk kids man  thats a lot of studs chains piercings etc what a hassle  im sure its a great place to go see celine dion acoustic or something equally lame  but why a place like that would book heavier stuff and then react like that is beyond me i felt like i was in jail only in jail the bathtub gin is cheaper and you dont get yelled at as bad for smoking too close to a doorway
