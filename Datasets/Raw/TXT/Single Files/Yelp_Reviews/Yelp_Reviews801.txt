i wish this place were better the only redeeming factor about this place is the happy hour i went here yesterday just after the lunch hour and the service and food were both below average dont get me wrong the hostesses were nice when they were actually around  i had the veggie burger and my friend had the beef brisket with bourbon sauce generally i find that if the veggie burger is good the normal is bad and vise versa however both were terrible my veggie burger had a terrible mush consistency and the quality of the bun was awful my friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless   for the price i would expect better food much better food   honestly they should get rid of the tables and add more beer taps quit the food up the drinks
