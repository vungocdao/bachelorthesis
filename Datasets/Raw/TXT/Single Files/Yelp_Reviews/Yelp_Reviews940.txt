well this has been one of my favorite courses since i moved here in  i have played this course many many times however it has a few years since i have been there and i had yet to play the new renovated course  i have used the practice range a few times since the course reopened and like the new additions so i was excited to play the course again and see the new changes  i was a little disappointed  the carts are new club cars and they are equipped with a gps featured that disables the golf cart if the driver takes the cart into an area where it should not be i can certain understand how this is a good idea however i think they have the settings a little too high  if you approach the green from the wrong side the disable feature engages  the cart paths are for the most part gone  they are still in a temporary club house from  years ago  i read in the paper that the management company that was awarded the contract to run the course is having some challenges   that is an understatement   so i guess this course will go down in my memory similar to the other phoenix landmarks that are now gone  similar to the old cine capri movie theater on th street  i would rather remember papago golf course as the great muni it was rather then the course in disrepair that it is now
