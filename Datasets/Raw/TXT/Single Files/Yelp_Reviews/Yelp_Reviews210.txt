some good some bad  this goes for the food and the service  you must check your order if its to go in any of the locations  i have had more mistakes than correct orders in the last year or so    the presses are microwaves  they are not training their employees to know this and they are not making it public  i had an employee actually argue about it with me this morning because i wanted them to toast my bagel and assemble the egg and cheese without nuking it  i got to my car and they had forgotten the cheese  i went back and the cook told me that the counter person didnt know if i wanted it  i think someone should have double checked if this was the case as the sandwich comes with cheese to begin with  even burger king doesnt microwave their breakfast
