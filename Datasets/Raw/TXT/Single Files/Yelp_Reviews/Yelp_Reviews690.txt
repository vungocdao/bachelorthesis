did you know the specials are here at the top because the greasily myopic server will remind you of this no matter how frequently you visit  you could get the best damned french toast in the world at sams every weekend and im pretty sure hed still point out the special  did you read what i wrote there  best damned french toast in the world  how is it so good  thats a good question  somehow the combination of totally ordinary white bread and totally ordinary pancake batter transcends the potential of both parts to result in something truly droolworthy a giant slab of golden brown toast in a pool of butter and syrup  if you like french toast theres no reason to consider anything else on the menu  but if you do youll find that they also have grits  a rarity above the masondixon line  swimming in butter crispy bacon truly overmedium eggs and delicious pancakes  the coffee is well blackish but its really not fair to judge a diner on the quality of their coffee  your mug will always be full for better or for worse  my husband and i moved away from champaign in  but make a point of having breakfast at sams whenever were back  there are betterforus breakfasts in champaign  there are fancier breakfasts in champaign  but theres only one sams and well keep coming back as long as it sticks around
