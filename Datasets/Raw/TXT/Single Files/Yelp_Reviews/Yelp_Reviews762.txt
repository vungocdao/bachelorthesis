i booked a stay at hotel san carlos for one night through groupon for  after taxes most other hotels in the area go for  so finding this deal was awesome my boyfriend and i live in az and he wanted to celebrate his birthday by having a staycation downtown so we could have fun with family and friends without worrying about a way to get home at the end of the night originally we were going to book a night at hotel palomar but like i said we werent looking to spend a lot of money  i started reading reviews before we checked in and was feeling nervous that i hadnt made a good decision because there were more bad than good things being said from the moment we got to the hotel to the time we checked out our stay was anything from dissappointing the staff was nice and let us check in early before we parked we talked to the valet service and asked for advice on parking they could have given us excuses to use their service but instead they pointed across the street and let us know that on the weekends parking in those spots were free awesome free parking   once we got to our room everything was clean and the room was a nice temperature the rooms are small and the bathroom is even smaller but i didnt expect anything else its a little ridiculous how many people complained about the raised up part of the floor you have to step over to get in the shower wahhh i barely noticed it and anyone with a brain should have no problems stepping over it also the shower does fluctuate in temperature when someone flushes a toilet but it was never an unbearable cold or heat once we got settled in we went to the pool its a cute little pool but by the time we got out there the sun was covered by the building surrounding it so that was a bummer   for lunch we went next door to mccafferys they have great food and our bartender was great   honestly i have no complaints about our stay its a cute little hotel and for staying on a saturday night there were no dramatic noises going on and i didnt hear anyone talking in another room having sex or going to the bathroom i heard a couple of door slams but i think at any hotel its typical all the bad reviews are obviously from people who have a case of first world problems wahhh no room service wahhh the rooms are too small wahhh i couldnt control the room temperature wahhh theres something i have to lift my foot up  inches from the ground to get over in to the shower wahhh  wahhh  wahhh  get over it people take your spoiled attitudes over to the hyatt
