i stayed three nights here on business and really enjoyed the hotel and its staff the place felt clean uptodate and comfortable all the staff were friendly and everything was easy from checkin to checkout   the rooms have high ceilings and were nicely furnished and the rd floor courtyard even had its own bbq for guest use which seemed like a nice thought   id stay there again for sure
