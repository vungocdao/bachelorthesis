this is a nice looking but poorly designed hotel despite having over  rooms they only have  elevators i was here for a convention with a friend who recently had foot surgery and needed a wheelchair lets just say other hotel guests were not gracious about giving us priority on the elevators even though we were on the second floor and even the largest of humans should be able to manage  flight of stairs with  good feet checkout was a nightmare because of this elevator situation fortunately a staff member was kind enough to allow us access to the service elevator after he saw how rude the guests were about this  the food is also terrible and overpriced several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari that was no fun for anybody i highly recommend the sprecher brewery restaurant across the street  comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food   the temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well our room was cold no matter how high we adjusted the thermstat and the convention space was hot enough that i nearly fainted on at least  occasions the only reason this hotel gets  stars is because it was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable with their downfilled duvets and fluffy pillows
