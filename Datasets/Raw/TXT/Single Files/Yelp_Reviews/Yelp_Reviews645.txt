the worst arbys i have ever eaten at if you want a good one visit the one on park  so here is why it is bad  the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered four different sandwiches this is compared to other arbys ive eaten at  they say they dont have any monthly deals i was told they belong to the same owner as the one on park and they have monthly deals  tried it twice and both times they messed up our order we paid but did not get things  their customer service is awful i dont expect much in life but when i go somewhere to give them my money  i expect better than what i got here
