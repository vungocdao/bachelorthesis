ive gotten massages from modern salon several times and loved them all there until the last time when i lost my penchant after learning the masseuse i had used before no longer worked there his replacement was a woman who did nothing but make me more tensed up than when i came in it wasnt until after i already paid for the service gave her a tip and went home that i started thinking in retrospect then got mad that i actually paid for something that made me feel worse it was some time ago so i will have to call them to see if her names on record so i can recommend not using her i dont think she listened to a word i said i had the hour massage and i explained to her before hand that i wanted her to mainly focus on my upper back  neck because i had a lot of pain in the area from working on the computer  until finishing a job that week i also told her i prefer harder pressure i have never had a massage like that before she did nothing but tickle me i told her at least twice that she can use more pressure but i guess she didnt care then she ends up paying the least amount of attention to my problem areas i asked her to focus on i guess i was being too nice i should have asked for someone else but i didnt want to hurt her feelings   i havent had a massage there since then but i love getting my haircuts there ive had a few different stylists but loved each one they were especially helpful when i had to undergo chemotherapy treatments which made me lose all of my hair when it finally started growing back in it was a mess they helped my hair to look  feel so much better and healthier   the staff are all friendly and pleasant the spa upstairs is nice and separated from the more chaotic salon and registers the spas waiting area is comfy and quiet and the dressing roomsshowerssauna room is nice and offers a nice assortment of aveda products to test out
