im from california and hotcakes is something thats not common in our food vocabulary we just settle on pancakes and call it a day  my brother took me and my mother to pamelas for brunch and it was pretty packed fortunately it was only a  minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us i glanced through the menu and learned that theyre known for their specialty hotcakes they all looked very good but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes was craving strawberries we finally got seated ordered what we want and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner the food came out relatively fast and i was ecstatic for my hotcakes they use fresh strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can the hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part a bit heavy on the butter but thats how you get the crispiness the sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element as for the brown sugar that was like the cherry on top it was pure harmony  definitely check it out when youre in pittsburgh
