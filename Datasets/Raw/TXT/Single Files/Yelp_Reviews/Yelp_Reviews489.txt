recently joined the ymca and this is my home ymca  i love the equipment and most of the staff  i have hit the gym been a member about  days at very varied times but have settled on  am for strength training monwedfri and pm ish for cardio tuesthurssat  at either time it isnt overwhelmingly crowded  i will say at  am and i assume other times there are plenty of meat heads in the weight room  grunting slamming weights flexing in the mirror  i also  find it entertaining to see the fashion show that occurs in the weight room i like to ppl watch between sets   i have never seen so many coordinated work clothes in my entire life  matching shows pantsshortsshirts and often times hats  none of this bothers me it is just entertaining  i have not met anyone very friendly there and i assume that is because it is the sopark area  but since i dont go to the gym to socialize i guess it doesnt matter
