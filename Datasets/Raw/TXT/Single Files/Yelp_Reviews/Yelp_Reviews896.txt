i visit phoenix frequently and this is my first stay at this location the hotel is marginal but needs some major updates the breakfast is less than mediocre and seems like they are always low on supply the last  mornings i arrived to find nothing but crumbs left for eggs lastly  the customer service rep i wont mention any names who checked me in needed additional training on how to treat loyal customers she was very rude and short during check in which i find uncommon for the brand
