red alert red alert   if you are looking for good mobile phone customer service this is not the store im changing my provider to verizon or att after the experience i had last night heres how it went down  i headed in around pm as my contract expired so i needed to upgrade my phone and sign on for two more years when i entered i noticed around eight employees out front and three in the backso i thought to myself this wont take long there are a ton of people working i signed in with the receptionist who told me the wait to buy a new phone would be  minutes no biggie i told her ill just go check out all the gadgets   forty minutes later i was still waiting  and showing as third on the list for service now this wouldnt be a big deal if i wasnt watching the employees talk to each other and head into the back for long periods of time while customers were waiting out front i literally timed two people between customers  one waited over  minutes before helping someone else and the second employee wasnt helping anyone when i left and it had been  minutes since his last customer   needless to say i left the storebut not before telling them to take me off the list so the poor people in line after me didnt have to wait even longer i will not be back and have been researching other providers today
