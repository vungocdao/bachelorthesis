this was my first experience eating jack in the box since i moved from ga to az  days ago the service was horrible cashier had attitude when i told her i was still reviewing the menu when i was ready to place my order she was very rude  sighing as if she needed me to speed up then i watched as she prepared her food placed it on a tray  walked off as my food sat in the window the drivethru person came to see if i had been helped  proceeded to bag my food after i told him i was waiting this place needs better service
