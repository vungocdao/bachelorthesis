love this place i was visiting pittsburgh from houston and we decided to finish off our visit with this museum  or should i say museums coming from houston where we have some pretty good museums this was a pleasant surprise  really cheap considering you get both art and natural history the dinosaur exhibit was so interesting and educational  the gem and mineral exhibit was huge and the art museum had a surprisingly awesome collection  i was thrilled to see a couple van goghs monets cezannes etc the only exhibit i didnt much care for was the temporary art exhbit  some contemporary craziness that involved body parts dangling from the ceiling at least it gave us something to talk about all in all i did not spend nearly as much time here as i could have and would have liked i highly recommend this for anyone visiting pittsburgh
