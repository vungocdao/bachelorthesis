this is an oldschool pizza shop  im sure that many of the foodietypes who frequent yelp are going to dismiss this place but having heard so much about it from my local pizzaloving friends about the pie at fioris i finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while i was in the neighborhood  the sauce definitely isnt for everyone  its a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to  but the sauce is interesting and the crust is perfect  a little too much flour used when it was flown but im guessing thats because the place was doing such a high volume of business  the pepperoni reminds me of the old mineos pizza small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools  wow now thats the pepperoni i love and definitely not the pepperoni youll find at papa johns or vocellis or dominos or little caesars or pizza hut  this is the pizza of your youth  the pizza you remember your dad bringing home complete with the relicstyle pizza box  its not in my neighborhood and im lucky enough to live close to lucianos but if im hungry and in the vicinity of fiores any time soon i wont hesitate to grab a couple more pies  maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast
