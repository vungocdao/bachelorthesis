might not be the easiest location to visit or see but its a good option because of the people that work here  tucked away across a parking lot and underneath an overhand is this showmars location but there are a lot of regulars that frequent this place  the servers and folks running the register are super nice and they recognize you call you by name and ask how your work day is going  i take my lunch around pm so way after the lunch rush but i can imagine this place being super busy  there are a lot of tables and booths to sit at and the food comes out fast  with daily specials  super affordable and predictable you can have you food in front of you pretty quickly  especially if you are trying to do a quick lunch  now this place is pretty practical if you work uptown and can walk here for lunch  probably not a place to drive to since you would have to pay for parking somewhere even if you park on the street at a metered spot
