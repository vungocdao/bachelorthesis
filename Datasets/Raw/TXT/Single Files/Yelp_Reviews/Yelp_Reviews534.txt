this week i took my son to see the chipmunks squeakquel or whatever its called weve been here several times before since it is in the university city area near where we live   there is plenty of parking lines for tickets are usually long and uncomfortable in the cold blowing wind of december or the humid summer heat for that matter why cant they put the ticket counters on the insides of theaters this is one tradition that should be broken soon  matinee tickets for the two of us were    the theater itself is in good shape movies are usually in focus and the sound is usually okay with some distortion but not great frankly dvds sound better in my living room  but concessions are a complete ripoff i usually know this but jay talked me into it we got a medium huge popcorn two small bladderbusting drinks and a box of twizzlers twenty friggin bucks im sure the dvd wouldnt cost  to buy and we could watch it over and over i doubt well be buying it the movie is grade b entertainment funny once but pretty stupid to watch as a rerun  the restroom had no paper towels and the trash cans were overflowing a smell of stale vomit permeated the area by the sinks   for a family i think money spent on a large lcd tv and a home theater in a box sound system is a wise investment rent movies from red box or netflix or hook up an apple tv or something similar and you have a better movienotgoing experience   i can make much better and less expensive popcorn and the adults and i can have a beer and i can pause the movie for those allimportant lets all go to the lobby breaks  every time i go to the theater to see a flick on the big screen im more and more disappointed by the experience i guess a lot of others feel the same way since the theater we were in was nearly empty  its a pit
