the portions are huge and the wait time is rather long  its always an annoying comfort when you have to wait a hour to get seated  it means youve chosen the right place to eat and that seemingly everyone else in the city has chosen the same place  the food isnt exactly unique but the price is definitely a steal  my western omelette lasted me  consecutive meals  their hash brown mash must have an addictive additive mixed in with its goodness because i cant seem to stop scooping those potatoes into my mouth  go my fellow charlotteans  itll be worth the wait and kind to your wallets
