my girlfriend and i were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel this was the third of three gay bars we went into that night we didnt even have a drink at the second one and it was by far our favorite not a lot of female patroons so if youre a lady on the prowl i would probably go somewhere else but if you just want to relax in a comfortable friendly atmosphere with some decent music this is the place  there were two bartenders and we happened to sit on jeffs side im sure they were both quite capable but jeff was amazing at making us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up even then he made sure we were taken care of hes pretty much amazing and has great eyebrows  i guess there was some craziness and fighting by the door and outside as the night got later but we never saw it and it didnt clear out the whole bar i would expect a downtown bar to have a few problems and it seemed like they were taken care of efficiently no strikes there  we stuck to beers and the prices were very reasonable considering the downtown location apparently happy hour runs until midnight we were able to both have some drinks on the cheap and listen some good music definitely returning whenever were there again
