after reading such rave reviews about this place i figured i had to check it out the service here is fantastic i was quickly greeted and seated my server was also very knowledgeable about the menu i ordered the vegetarian tostada and the spinach and cheese quesadilla both were delicious the prices are very reasonable i recommend this place if your looking for good inexpensive comfort food
