dr austin is an amazing physician  she is compassionate caring and thorough  she is the only physician in her office which means when she needs to provide more time to patients before you you will wait  but guess what one day that may be youyou may need that extra time  so i have never once been upset if my appointment wasnt started at the exact minute it was scheduled  she has been my primary doctor for over seven years and unless she retires she will be my primary physician for the foreseeable future  if your treatment requires more specialized treatment she knows who and where to send you  as a middle aged man i purposely chose dr austin because she is smart compassionate listens thorough and has never once said fully booked when ive asked to see her for any reason that day  if you are looking for a great doctor dr austin is it
