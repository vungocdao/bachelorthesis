i just love going here  you can find anything you need and a whole bunch of eccentric and cool gifts that you know no one else will have    so normally i go there to browse in their extensive wine selection and end up leaving with a few bottles of dessert wine  or i grab some sake which i absolutely love and cant find anywhere else  its at this point when i hit up their deli for a delicious tuna salad sandwich  its so disgustingly good its sinful  the people that work there are so nice and helpful  all in all just a great experience
