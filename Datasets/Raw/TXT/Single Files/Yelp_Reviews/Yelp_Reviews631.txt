my previous review was for an oil change which i still stand by  this time i brought in my car because it was making a rattling noise  i was told that the bracket holding my flex tube was broken and it would be around  to replace the whole pipe  the pipe itself was not damaged and i asked if there was a cheaper option to attach the pipe back to the car either by welding it or creating a new bracket the mechanic gave me a rude answer about coat hangers    i called around and was quoted  to replace the pipe at speedys muffler when i brought it in there to get it replaced they told me the pipe itself could just be bracketed to the car for    make sure you call around before getting work done here in case there are other repair options that chets didnt consider
