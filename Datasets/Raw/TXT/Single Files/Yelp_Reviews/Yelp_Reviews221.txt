i dont normally come to this laundromat but the machines in my apartment had been broken for a week and i was getting desparate  although parking can be a bit of a pain i was pleasantly surprised with this place  there are plenty of washers and dryers to choose from from regular sized to freakin  pound capacity and they all seemed to be working great  its airconditioned and clean with vending machines and some old arcade games to spend some more of your quarters on  my sister and i did four loads of laundry and it cost us about  per load  oh yeah and they have a change machine that apparently takes    and  dollar bills  if i am ever in a pinch again i will be coming here
