i cannot sing tim walters praises loud enough  i have taken my car to him for about  years and i always leave with a new experience attesting to his awesomeness if you think you might have something wrong with your car that youre not sure what it is you can just stop by and hell usually take a break from what hes working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion then when he diagnoses your car hell explain it to you like youre not an idiot and hell make sure you understand whats going on hes incredibly honest and cares about his customers for instance once i had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didnt have it in stock he told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it the price difference was like ten bucks so i had him do it because it wasnt an emergency and id rather give him my business hes awesome
