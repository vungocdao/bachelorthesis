decent selection and clearance pricing can be found at the brooks brothers store  once youre done shopping and still have some time to kill before catching your flight you can rest your bottom on one of the dozens of white rocking chairs that line the atrium  the rocking chairs are a nice perk and you should definitely try to take advantage of them if you can  the only complaint i have are with the transport carts  they are constantly beeping no matter what direction theyre going  i can understand the beeping while in reverse but its really annoying when its constant  especially when you have  minutes to kill at the gate  thank goodness for the free wifi
