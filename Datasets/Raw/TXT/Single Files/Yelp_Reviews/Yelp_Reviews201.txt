currently sitting in the restaurant got seated very quickly around pm for the first time ever the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fiancue in it we sat until  without so much as a hello from a nearby server people were sat after us and have already received food we finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed she then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses ive never received great service here but its never been this subpar either this may be the last straw for this place three strikes and youre out markpi  ps i ordered a diet coke and received a glass of what seems to be robitussin that or theres alcohol in this drink either case im not thrilled
