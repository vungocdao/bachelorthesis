this is a small shabbychic french restaurant serving simple french food  the style of cooking is from the brittany region of france in the north and hardier less complex and less delicate than the stereotypical french cuisine  the menu is small is its a little more expensive than the average place in cu but the food we ate was tasty filling and a nice change  i recommend the salmon starter and specials  service was relaxed and friendly but not slow  my parents both enjoyed the coffee
