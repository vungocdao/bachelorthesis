i would give them zero stars if it were an option no one came to wait on us i had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter well call him mr personality because he never did tell us his name i should have known we were in trouble when he didnt bother to write down our order my caesar salad came without the requested onions my grilled salmon was overcooked the vegetables were bland the waiter took away my halfempty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water he never offered us dessert the rest rooms were filthy i would never recommend this place to anyone
