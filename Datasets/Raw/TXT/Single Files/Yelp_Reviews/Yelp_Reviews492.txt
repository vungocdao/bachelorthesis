the little hippie food market that could seems so out of place in the corridor of crap that is independence boulevard but i gotta tell ya this store is amazing for just about any special dietary need  the star of this market is the aislelong bulk foods section that puts anything at our other local grocery stores to shame  whether you need dried fruits spices or nuts or grains even candies im pretty sure they have it here and also have it as an organic option  you get as much as you need and then write the code on the side of the bag to be weighed at the checkout  they also have just about every homeopathic remedy you could need too  again you can get herbs by bulk or just about any nutrientsupplement your heart desires  big selection of incense and candles too  if you have gluten allergies this ought to be your goto they have a bigger selection than i have seen just about anywhere else  also vegetarianvegan friends will find a healthy supply and selection of different options here too  they have a fresh produce section that is small but can do in a pinch same goes for fresh meats and frozen foods  id still look elsewhere for regular shopping for these items however  i have to deduct a start here because the store does get a little crowdedfeeling and just has the appearance of being somewhat rundown like most of its neighboring businesses which is far below the standard at any of the other speciality grocers in town  still the store is never loaded with people and the staff is most helpful if approached  i still dont know why they put this store where it is but im not going to complain because im glad its there
