tried this place on a lazy sunday evening at the recommendation of other reviews and i would say what others have said is pretty accurate it is very authentic looks like a total dive from the outside and its in a hispanic neighborhood but the tacos here are great now just to be clear these are street style tacos they are small but they are only each which seems pretty reasonable   i ordered an adobada al pastor carnitas and a shredded beef with red chiles each were very good in their own unique ways the meat was good quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor the adobada was the standout in my mouth so much that i had to go back and order another one i also had a side of rice and beans which were good but nothing out of the ordinary   so far so good right the only slip up this place maybe has is that my girlfriend that was with me who doesnt eat meat was not overly impressed she got a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco the shrimp taco looked good and she said everything tasted alright but she was not wowed like i was about the quality of the tacos she did enjoy the beans and rice though so this place might not be the best veg friendly location but im not really going to take off for that because it is very authentic and veg friendly isnt necessarily what they are trying to do they are trying to make good traditional tacos and that they do that very well   they also serve beer here and i love the way its served your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted salted and has lime juice in the bottom speaking of bringing you the glass the service is wonderful our server was very friendly patient nice and helpful   all in all if you are looking for a good taco shop nothing fancy and authentic this might be your best bet or at least it is from the places i have been so far
