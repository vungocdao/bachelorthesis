crust takes almost exactly like cardboard and the toppings are icky  i cant imagine why anyone would order from here  although i did make a second order from here one time  new years eve in fact  but that was only because the cab we had booked never showed up to bring us back home from downtown  so i walked here ordered a pizza to be delivered to my house then tried to make the delivery guy drive me and the pizza  pretty smart huh  too bad they wouldnt let me though  so i canceled the ordered and kept on walking  and walking  and walking  its a long way to east urbana from downtown champaign  in the cold  on new years eve
