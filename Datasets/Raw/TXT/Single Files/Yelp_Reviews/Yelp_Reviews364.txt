maybe its because i went on a thursday with colleagues but apparently its rb night or jazz night or something  they play some old school cds really loud so its hard to maintain a decent conversation  on top of that its old school cds bc the music would skip  we asked them to turn it down off and their response was its rb night  uh so who cares literally there was us and  old cougars sitting at the bar  thats about it note we were not sitting with these cougars but the amount of times they were looking over at our table i thought it was feeding time  feeling like a piece of meat sheesh  hardly a rb night if you ask me  beers were fine i liked the multitude of screens  but its so dead on thursday bc of jazz night  just giving them a heads up lets trash that idea yeah     lol  other corporate dudes walked in was looking around saw cougars  music skipping and peaced out  we totally should have done that  dmo out
