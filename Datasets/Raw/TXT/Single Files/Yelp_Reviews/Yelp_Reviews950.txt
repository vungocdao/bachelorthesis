came here for a drug screen for a new job tried to call for  days to set up a time to come in time is money every time i tried to call the number listed the call would ring and then just disconnect so due to the fact there is a time expiration on the drug screen came in to get it done show up find out there is over an hour wait just to pee in a cup ask if there is any way i can just go because this whole procedure is going to take less the a minute to do ask to speak to a manager david who is extremely rude and proceeds to tells i can either wait or leave i explain i have been trying to call the location to set up a time were he basically tells me that there is nothing wrong with the phones he has been talking on them all day but i have been here over  minutes now and have not heard the phone ring once overall the place is dirty the wait is ridiculous especially for a basic drug screen and the staff is extremely rude i highly suggest never ever coming here i know i will never be back ever
