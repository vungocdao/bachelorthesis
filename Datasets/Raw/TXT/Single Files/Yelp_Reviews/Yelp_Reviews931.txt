my family and i have had our phoenix zoo membership for  year now we love it it is worth every penny we go at least  time per month and always have a great time the volunteers are extremely friendly we have only met  who was not even when it is too hot in the summer to do anything outdoors we go to the zoo we play at the water park then go straight home   we watch many families parents rushing their children through the zoo to the point that the kids dont have fun with a membership we are always walking at a leisurely pace sometimes we go and only see a hand full of animals sometimes we go to ride our bikes around and dont stop at the animals at all   we love that the new kimono dragon exhibit is in and are excited to see the orangutan exhibit being started my daughter is learning quite alot at the zoo at  she is already interested in traveling the world to see these animals in their native habitat   now i must say if you have been to the san diego zoo please realize that the phoenix zoo can not compare so dont go to the phoenix zoo expecting anything more than a great zoo for education purposes but it is the nd best zoo i have been to   my family is from a small city in arizona we moved to phoenix primarily due to the culture a big city can provide for raising children i chose to live in s scottsdale specifically because the phoenix zoo is about  miles away from my home
