we went in there on sunday for lunch it was packedwell the foyer was at least after sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe  full of customers i was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess there was one person taking names another checking the names two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and im hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice so my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with chicken she has a standard and i ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef toss it with some pasta and voila dinner  the humorous moment was when the server asked me how i would like my braised beef doneits braised look it up anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley to make it appear fresh though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good  minutes the salad we got was marginal i dont get what the big deal is and the breadsticks seemed like theyd been sitting in the basket for  minutes not so hot while our food  wasnt absolutely horrible i dont understand why this place is full all the time i would love for it to be another  years or more until i eat here againglad i wasnt paying for it
