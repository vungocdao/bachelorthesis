this placement doesnt even deserve a star so i guess one will do the only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess after that everything else went downhill my server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food she looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust brought me a meal different from what i ordered and didnt have the guts to apologize for it the food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat place wasnt that busy so i fail to understand why it took over  min to get my food and it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me when she asked me how the food was i told her that it wasnt what i ordered and she just rolled her eyes i was tired and didnt want to start fussing with her so i just paid and left but one thing i can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when i requested for my check it came in less than  seconds this is the worst applebees experience ive ever had in my life and i dont think i ever want to go to an applebees if this is the kind of service i get over to you mr applebees ceo
