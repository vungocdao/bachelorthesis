we went to nakato last night for dinner  the food was average in taste much smaller portions and higher prices than before and the service was not good at all  we waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check  my wife had to remind the waiter that she hadnt gotten her sushi order  we had a coupon and they added  for a gratuity per the coupon which we didnt see beforehand  the coupon is a scam so watch out  we wouldnt have tipped that much based on the above comments  our table mates asked for a birthday greeting which never happened  yes we have been eating here for  plus years but likely will not return as things have declined so much recently  no one ever came to our table to ask how things were going  a sign of poor customer relations
