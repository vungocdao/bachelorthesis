i hate giving star reviews but im not sure how else to rate the overall experience  the atlas court location appears to be quite aged extremely cramped and lacks quality customer service they do have a ton of equipment available but thats about it  i arrived on saturday morning with my reservation for a  truck firmly inhand there was a line of people waiting to checkincheckout equipment and only one person working behind the counter   the employee a younger gentleman appeared to be struggling with everything he did and he wasnt shy about hiding his frustrations after waiting for around  minutes another employee i believe hes the manager jumpedin and helped folks the manager was much more proficient helpful and friendly i was third or fourth in line and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer  when i went to get my truck there was an equipment problem so they substituted another truck for me unfortunately the truck that i was provided was ancient  it had  miles on it the check engine light was on and it ran so poorly that i thought i was going to breakdown at several points along the way the steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire tim
