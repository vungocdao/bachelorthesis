they seem to have everything obscure films b films foreign films nearly every weird movie ive found out on the internet they have it one time there was some anime i wanted to see but they didnt have but they explained that all the copies out there were pirated and theyd be happy to add it to their collection if i could find a legitimate source for them  secondly its pretty cheap if you buy a renters block  i kind of wish there was a way to return videos without wading into campus though
