typically im not a huge fan of artifact and cultural exhibits  however the heard experience was beyond expectations   the  student price was reasonable and we were instantly put on a walking tour around the museum the guides were excellent and the museum is quite historic     the contemporary art pieces are not quite art museum worthy  however the katina doll collection was awesome  they have barry goldwaters personal collection of katina dolls on display     i highly suggest using the guided tours  because some of the exhibits are difficult to process
