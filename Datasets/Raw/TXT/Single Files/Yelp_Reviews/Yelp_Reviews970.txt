oh ajs if you didnt exist less than  blocks from my apartment i would never go to you although you have highclass pretensions and several amicable sommeliers your employees are aware that you are a ripoff  case in point i go to ajs on st paddys day  looking for some corned beef  corned beef steak remains about  pounds price  when i lived in oregon last year i was able to get  pounds of corned beef a very cheap cut and preparation of beef for under  i mentioned the price gouging to the guy behind the meat counter and i quote hahahahahahahaha  nothing else no joke they know theyre overpriced they sell the exact same things as food city for x the price same company owns frys food city and ajs because they know that a tamale will be something the whitebread customers of ajs will consider a delicacy unavailable outside of the spanish mass at their local catholic church and worthy of more than  apiece  furthermore more whole and organic foods are sold at any one sprouts trader joes fresh and easy and whole foods than any ajs that ever existed  avoid this place unless youre a yuppie with too much money and not enough sense or unless you think one of the sommeliers is hot  stars for the awesome beer selection
