ive been popping into the george and dragon nearly every thursday since last april for trivia nights  i like the place  the trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in but not worn down  i feel comfortable and welcome every time i visit  most weeks i end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection  the drink prices while high for some peoples tastes are comparable to what ive seen in other places  imports are going to cost more its the price you pay to have a selection of boddingtons murphys and guinness all in one place among other things  normally on trivia nights i dont end up getting food as although i find their portions proportional to the prices i dont feel i need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting  i have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions ive grabbed some eats for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended  the dragon wings are another of my favorite spicy but not overwhelming  the fish and chips as previously mentioned are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent  i recommend at least one visit to this bar  dont be scared off by the divey look of the pubfront  the fc scarves adorning the ceiling british booze advertisements on the walls and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert  if you do visit pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night  who knows you may become a regular before you know it
