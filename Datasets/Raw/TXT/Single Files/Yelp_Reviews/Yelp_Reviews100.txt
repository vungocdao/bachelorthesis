yes i went and had the tacos yes the lengua tacos yes i know they were good did you also know that you can buy homemade tortilla chips in hella bulk along with any kind of sauce you can imagine if you suddenly need plantains for a questionable contribution to a fireside potluck you can get those here too im not sure what else you can really ask for in a mexican food store nope pretty sure theyve got it all oh if you buy a plantain that is pitchblack or you find that your plantains at home have gone pitchblack simply slice them open place in oven bake until warm and tender then spread with guava paste available at reyna foods so the man at the counter tells me true story
