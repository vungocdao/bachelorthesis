my boyfriend and i stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the north shore area which was a short car ride away we got a very good rate on hotwireotherwise i dont think we would have been able to stay here although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms including the bathroom i was sitting up in bed reading and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake  parking was also expensive we needed to use the car several times during our stay so we had to valet park which was over day plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car  the coffee shop attached to the hotel is just ok the breakfastlunch place was not very good you will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food other than the hotel restaurant which i cant comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices  one perkthe hotel does offer free internet but it is a low bandwidth version we didnt need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed so we used the free version it gets the job done for email and web browsing but it does not stream videos well  the bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good i agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as i have seen in other westinsno bathrobe room service menu not as good staff not quite as helpful also because it is a green hotel they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries if you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies be sure to request that we came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a halffull bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used not sure if they had just gotten that from someone elses room gross or it had just spilled and they didnt want to waste it they also failed to replace our inroom coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more  all in all we definitely would not pay full price to stay here but might consider it again if there was another great deal
