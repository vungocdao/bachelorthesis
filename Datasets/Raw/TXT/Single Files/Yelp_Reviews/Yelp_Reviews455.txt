be prepared to wait we were told to be here at  for an  appointment coming up on an hour wait ugh after waiting over an hour to see the doctor and to only talk to him for  minutes was very disappointing  the appointment was for my mother who was previously told she could undergo a specific eye surgery and then upon arriving and preop review she was not qualified not only was the experience in this office disappointing it was a disappointing day for my mother after expectations were expected
