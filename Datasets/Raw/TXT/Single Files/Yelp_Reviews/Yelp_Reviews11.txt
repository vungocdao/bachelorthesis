unos has been around for ever  i feel like this restaurant chain peak in popularity in the s honestly the decor inside still kind of looks s to me even though its nice with sleek booth and exposed brick  if you havent died and he recently i ordered you to come back and have a meal here again because honestly the food is really quite good  they have the best chicken salad wrap ever i love that rap so much i want agreed to walk the south side river trail from where the steelers practice all the way to the damn waterfront just because i knew that i could convince my boyfriend to go to unos with me for lunch  full disclosure  i made him call is a cab and we took a taxi back to the parking lot after lunch  listen the food and pizza and service are very good surprisingly so i dont know why this place is not busier but next time youre down at the waterfront please do consider dining here
