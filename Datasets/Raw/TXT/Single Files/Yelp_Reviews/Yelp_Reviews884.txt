this might be a good way to kill time if youre near the airport the food really wasnt that great it tasted cheap and like it had been sitting there for a very long time i had the caldo  mares and it was lukewarm wayyy too salty and the shrimp were mushy it was pretty gross the carne asada tacos were mostly gristle and i couldnt really taste my enchilidas with the thick blanket of sour cream over them for  i couldve gotten much better mexican food somewhere else
