every time i have been to casbah for lunch brunch or dinner the food has been great and the service has been impeccable  sure ive had more exceptionally delicious and unique meals in pittsburgh but casbah has consistent awesomeness down pat  just get a reservation ahead of time  also the desserts are mandatory    the duck confit gnocchi is smashing its a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savoryand my favorite is probably the casbah doublecut pork chop superyum comfort food  the short rib ravioli is some potroasty goodness and the long island duck is another great choice    a nice surprise here are the great happy hour specials at the bar  try the boyd  blair cocktail and the sangria
