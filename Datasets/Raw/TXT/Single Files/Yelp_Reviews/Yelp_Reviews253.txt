everything about the pedi was ok except the polishing part   hours later i had to wear shoes and the polish smudged because it was slopped on so thick it never would have dried   as she was polishing my nails i was thinking man that is way too thick  itll never dry but i didnt say anything because i thought maybe she had some super topcoat that would make the impossible possible  well she didnt and the polish stayed not just tacky but downright wet for  hours before i finally just scraped the goop off and painted them myself    i will never be back and wish i had saved my  i had a groupon and my  tip  should have just done them myself
