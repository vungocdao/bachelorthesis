if you get nothing else here get the tom kha soup it is seriously the best ive ever had anywhere im not trying to be hyperbolic but this tom kha soup is the standard for which i compare all other tom kha soups ive yet to find its match it is truly delicious i usually get the veggie variation loaded up with silky smooth tofu and tons of veggies but any variation is just as wonderful   i just returned home from a trip to thai cuisine with some friends the environment is comforting and warm i love the lights strewn along the windows they just add to the coziness of the place after getting the obligatory veggie tom kha soup i got the green curry with shrimp others in my party got the yellow curry and the panang curry and everyone was pleased with their choices the green curry was a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies were nice and crisp  they were featuring their mango and sticky rice dessert i had a bite of my friends and i was sad that i was too full to have a dessert of my own   as we rolled out of our booth totally stuffed and satisfied we all proclaimed that this was the best decision we could have made with our night definitely one of the best thai restaurants in the city
