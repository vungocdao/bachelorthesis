beware   i had my car serviced here before leaving the pep boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance which seemed reasonable as it was showing no signs of problems following the oil change i drove home approximately  miles where the car sat for approximately one hour i then drove from my home approximately  miles where the car engine was stopped for  minutes   shortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than  more miles the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging i immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town when examining my car the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine   photos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic
