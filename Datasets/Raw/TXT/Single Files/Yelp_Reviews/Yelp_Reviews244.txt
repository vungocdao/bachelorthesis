they just broke into my house without any notice to show around they knocked so violently i almost mistaked it for gunfire then before i was able to say anything they broke in there was at most  seconds interval between the knock and the break in i wasnt dressed and the guy just said oh hi were showing the apartment and stormed into my kitchen ridiculous i started ranting as soon as they left the room this is totally invasive and disrespectful i didnt read their lease very carefully when i moved in and i totally regret it they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day so i thought whatever how bad could it be apparently breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here and if you dont comply theyll fine you as much as your units monthly rent around  for telling them no you cant enter the house ive heard of several cases like this theyre unbelievably hostile and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible
