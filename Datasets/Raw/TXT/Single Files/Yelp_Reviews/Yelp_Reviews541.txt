i came into a wealth of free bagel  cream cheese bagel coupons so i finally got a chance to check this place out  im usually not big on chain bagels but im not going to turn down a free meal either  i tried to go once before but they close at pm on sundays  the sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read  but the bottom lefthand corner of the  was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a    i finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese  the bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket  the jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal the people working there were friendly and accommodating  the main hangup was that the worker didnt offer to toast my bagel and me thinking this would be standard didnt ask left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel  after i took one bite i really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel  in nyc you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy but this one was a bit tough to swallow  i feel a conflict of interest when giving them only  stars since my bagel was free but itll have to remain at  until i get my next bagel also gratis before the coupon expires
