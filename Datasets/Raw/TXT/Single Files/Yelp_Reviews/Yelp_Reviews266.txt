will never come here again  my cat has cancer and was experiencing some new symptoms that needed possible ultrasounds we came to this cvs location because it was after hours and the cvs i usually go to in matthews wasnt going to have the ultrasound tech as soon as needed so we drove  minutes in the opposite direction to this location in huntersville  when we walked in around pm on a friday the place was packed to the brim all the exam rooms were full and there were about  people in the lobby okay so maybe that night we just had bad luck  no our greeting at the front desk was awful the secretary didnt even make eye contact with us and acted like we were inconveniencing her she was appalling and rude   we were told we would have to wait at least an hour because they were overly busy which we understood after a couple hours we asked if we could just check our sick kitty into the icu for the night and leave because we knew she needed overnight supervision  well the secretary didnt even come relay the no response to us  luckily not all of the staff were as dreadful as the secretary but we ended up waiting over  hours until am only to be told that they were admitting her into the icu overnight and running tests exactly as we requested before i know the protocol was to have the doctor chat a moment in person before we left but we felt that common sense wasnt being put to use at this facility
