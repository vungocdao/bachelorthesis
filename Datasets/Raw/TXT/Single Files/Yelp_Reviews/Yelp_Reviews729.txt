the good i liked the decor  it was very pretty the soup of the day was red peppergoat cheese  i could eat that every single day forever and be very happy extensive beer wine and cocktail list the boy said that his curried shrimp was light and pretty good  the bad the waiter was not friendly  he wasnt mean or bad at his job but there was no smile  ever the place is separated into two parts the bartapas area and the dinner area  the two sides allegedly do not communicate   you cant get anything from the tapas menu in the dinner side and viceversa  our suspicions were confirmed when we heard a waiter telling a customer that no he couldnt have the tapa of the day because he didnt even know what it was  what the f  why i had the korean hot pot  i was warned that it was spicy which it wasnt  it was extremely sweet  so much so that i had to stop eating by the time i reached the bottom layer of rice  it was like a half cup of brown sugar had been lacquered all over the rice  blech  the ugly i got food poisoning  thank you korean hot pot  my guts are still kvetching about you  the problem is they had so much deliciouslooking stuff on the menu that food poisoning aside ill still probably go back  if i come out unscathed next time well see about upping the score  really a   wouldve been perfect
