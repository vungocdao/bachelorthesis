very good greasyspoon mexican place  my husband and i both had margaritas and they were great not too sweet nice amount of salt  make sure you look at all of the options we ordered fresh which uses fresh lime juice  they have tons of tequila choices  nachos we shared were good and the small order was more than enough for two of us  my husband had the mixed fajitas and enjoyed them  portion was huge and we brought about half of it home i had the pozole and alex taco  both were flavorful  pozole had a nice amount of spice    well return
