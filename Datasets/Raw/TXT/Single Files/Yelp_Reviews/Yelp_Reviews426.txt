i wasnt supposed to be in charlotte but canceled flights etc  you know how that goes so i spent several hours here  things i like about this airport  interesting food options and what i had was good  i never expected to be eating tasty bbq brisket beans cornbread  fried pickles at an airport restaurant    rockers  all over the place there are rocking chairs  clean open feel to the architecture  smoothly operating airport  wireless  basically if you have to be stuck at an airport id take this one over many others
