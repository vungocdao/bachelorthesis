this shelter is fantastic and has generally very good friendly people on staff  the cats and dogs appear to be treated at least as well as one might expect  when i adopted one of my cats at this establishment i had to return the next day to have her spayed  they did it for free which was great but the reason they dont get five stars is that the desk clerk completely forgot about my cat and me and she left us waiting as she chatted on her cell phone with a friend she only remembered about us as she was walking out for a smoke and saw us sitting in the lobby
