what i love about yelp is that you will find hole in the wall spots that you would never try if not for the nearby search and prior reviewers telling you its okay try it  the grilled chicken burrito i had was delicious what makes their burritos is the tortilla  their tortillas are the best ive had in a long time add the great salsa bar small but fresh and you have a great local neighborhood gem  i would warn that my burrito was chuck full of grilled dark meat which i love but isnt for everyone  the smoky flavor from the grill makes the chicken extra flavorful  it also had delicious mexican rice  just enough melted cheese  their salsa was so good i finished every chip  this place would be compared to a locally owned baja fresh but so much better ingredients and true mexican flare right down to the mariachi music being piped in  you order at the counter and listen for your number to be called  the staff is great and constantly milling around clearing and cleaning tables  thanks chicos ill be back
