i am reviewing specifically the chicago hot dog cart in this home depot i love it  who in their right mind does not want to go to a store on a saturday afternoon shop and then have one of the best hot dogs in madison   im just saying for  i can have a chicago style hot dog loaded with all the fixins including a kosher pickle its great  my wife gets the chili dog and swears by it she also has said on multiple occasions at the home depot that the chili dog is one of the best in the area   who would guess that a small little hot dog stand sitting in the home depot was so awesome   im telling you instead of running out to your car to drive back home and think about doing your weekend warrior projects take a minute and snag a hot dog at the cart located inside the entrance of home depot  vienna dogs true chicago dog style great hot dog
