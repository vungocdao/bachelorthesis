having returned from a bbq binge in kansas city a few months ago we decided wed get ribs in celebration of the royals making the playoffs then winning the pennant and then again for game  of the world series so weve had smoky jons ribs and pork shoulder three times in three weeks  heres whats excellent the pork shoulder and the sauce are fantastic right up there with the best there is just yummy  heres whats not extremely inconsistent ribs i completely agree with another reviewer regarding the membrane it really ought to be removed every timenot doing so is laziness by the pitmaster  for us batch   was pretty good  not kc level but totally fine batch   really was kc level just excellenttender juicy ribs clean bones very nice food heaven batch   was terrible  dry meat thick membrane difficult to even cut into rib chunks theres no way what we received could have ever won an award from anyone  so after spending about  here in the last three weeks i cant recommend it hey ribs aint cheap and thats fine but its hard to justify if the quality isnt even close i realize there will always be slight variationsthats what makes bbq great but the incredible inconsistency here kills it for me
