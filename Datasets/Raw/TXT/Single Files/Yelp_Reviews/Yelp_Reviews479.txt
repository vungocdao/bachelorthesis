i do not get it  why does this place get voted best breakfast  we had been once before and the pancakes tasted funky and the eggs tasted fishy  tried again today and were again sorely disappointed  after struggling to piece together a breakfast and being told we couldnt do certain things because the computer wont let us we again got a subpar breakfast  so if you want to wakey wakey eggs  bacy avoid this place  you will only get eggo waffles and funky tasting food
