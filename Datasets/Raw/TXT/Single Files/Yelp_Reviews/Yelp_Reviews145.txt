i liked the decor of the place  when i lived in pittsburgh  years ago i was just out of college with no money and didnt care what i ate  so i spent a lot of time eating bar food pizza and  pierogies  i never knew there were fancy restaurants until i returned this week for work  i got the salad with pears  gouda which was delicious with a ton of cheese  i also had the octopus appetizer as a meal  i was surprised its much chewier than i expected  but the vinaigrette on it was tasty and the red potatoes and kalamata olives gave it a lot of flavor  the fruity sorbet was good as well    i though the service was great and the waiters didnt laugh at me for not knowing half the words on the menu  they were more than willing to explain
