heres the lowdown  theyre like every other shop that makes you take it in the chili ring they only did the bare minimum amount of work possible to align my vehicle i know a lot about alignment i would have done it myself if i had access to the equipment they only adjusted the toein and reported back that the bolt which actuates the upper control arm eccentric was frozen so they couldnt make the adjustment to the caster angle   i then informed jr pinhead that i have a benzomatic torch and can heat the bolt to loosen it which he replied that his tech had use a torch on all the bolts funny thing is in the report from the equipment all the angles were within spec that would have required heat to loosen the adjustment hardware with the exception of the frozen one  i used to work at a firestone and i thought that lazy shit was just at my location i was expecting this type of work from a local shop with a couple of random dopers not firestone
