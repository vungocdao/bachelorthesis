at my first visit this month dr radke and her assistants were wonderful i never had to wait long and most importantly radke really addressed my eye allergies a new phenomenon for me as a recent wisco resident and pointed me toward some new contacts that are amazingly comfortable  i really like that they offer optomap as an alternative to dilating your eyes it isnt covered under insurance but the cost is well worth avoiding dilation eye drops in my book
