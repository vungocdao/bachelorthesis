i went here a couple weeks ago and was pleased with my cheese steak i had it then with just the meat and cheese today when i returned the guy at the counter asks with onions and mushrooms okay yeah sweet or spicy peppers spicy please and what i received knocked the socks off that earlier sandwich   this place is tiny cramped a bit chaotic and is apparently cooled by wallmounted fans yet i can see myself going here on a regular basis so the next time youre having one of those moments like ameerah a opt for the cheese steak just be sure to let me know before hand so we can meet up
