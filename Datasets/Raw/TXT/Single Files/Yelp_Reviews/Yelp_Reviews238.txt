i never really understood why docs was so popular  i personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck  otherwise the prices suck beer served in  ounce cups on special for   come on the food is mediocre and the atmosphere is nonexistent  the drinks are weak as well    if youre looking for a night out there are better places close by in shadyside  the deck really is nice but it doesnt help the fact that the prices are terrible for drinks especially for what you get  that being said i end up here a lot because others seem to like itmaybe im missing something
