i ate here  years ago and had one of the best meals not sure what changed oh wait its the quality of the fish i got the caldo de pescados the sea bass was gross so then they brought me a sea bass with ancho chiles that looked good but again the fish was no bueno im real sorry i drove  minutes out of the way to come here and had  inedible entrees   crab tostada guacamole and margarita were ok but not worth the embarrassment of not eating  different dinners the staff was super nice about it and the owner didnt charge me i wanted to pay but he refused so nice but i felt terrible bad dream
