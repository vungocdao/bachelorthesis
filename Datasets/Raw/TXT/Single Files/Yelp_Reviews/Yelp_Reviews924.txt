when we called the motel before we arrived they said they had plenty of rooms available but when we got there the manager spent about  minutes searching for a room for us said several were in the middle of some maintenance  as we went to our room we noticed there were many rooms that did not appear to be occupied at all the drapes were open and rooms were dark  this was the same story and situation the past  times we stayed here  i think they just close rooms off period  found a used condom on floor under the bed and the wall near the sink had some drip stains from something i wont even hazard a guess about there is no way that room had been properly cleaned or sanitized  we will absolutely not be back here again
