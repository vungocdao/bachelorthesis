this should have been a better experience   ill begin with the food  we arrived on a sunday afternoon after a visit to the phoenix art museum  we ordered a blt salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish  we also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck  the salad was good and was accompanied by fresh hot bread  the minestrone soup was outstanding  the salad and soup were brought out early as we requested and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived  the manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some   so far a good dining experience  then the bill arrives  the salad was  and then entree was full price  we questioned the bill as the lunch menu said the salad would be  and the entree  off  the server actually apologizes and says hell have the manager correct the mistake  then he comes back and tells us sorry manager says lunch prices only apply monfri  nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies monday through friday and we were never told  i didnt press the issue paid the bill and off we go    what could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham  giving patrons a menu with lunch specials and prices and then waiting to mention that doesnt apply until the bill arrives disgraceful  deceptive business practices will trump decent food every time hence the twostars
