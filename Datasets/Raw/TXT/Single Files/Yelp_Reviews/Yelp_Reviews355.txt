since i have promised myself that im not allowed to move away from charlotte until i have eaten at every restaurant i figured that restaurant week would be a perfect time to visit luce a small uptown spot that has been on my list for years  upon arrival our table wasnt quiet ready  no problem there because the suggestion to grab a drink at the bar was a given  tucked away in the corner the attentive bargoddess quickly poured us wine and presented us with nibbles  supercrunchy potato chips which appeared to be made in house as well as a heaping handful of olives were placed in front of us    these olives    i wanted to fall asleep in a bowl if these olives  i dont know what kind of magic the cooksakaolivewizards behind the scenes of the closed kitchen put into them fresh garlic fresh rosemary tears of their first born but im talking life changing like little baby angels    the food was great service attentive and friendly ill definitely be backfor the olives
