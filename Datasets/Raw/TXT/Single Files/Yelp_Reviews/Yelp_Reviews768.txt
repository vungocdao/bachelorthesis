last night was my first time in the little theater which is part of phoenix theater  i didnt see it on the list so im reviewing it here   we saw reefer madness the musical  it was awesome  i couldnt stop laughing  the sound of the theater was excellent   it was definitely small and the seats very uncomfortable  they had snacks out during intermission  we bought two water bottles and i was happy to see them put a box out for recycling the water bottles and the soda cans  they also had a box out for recycling the programs once the play finished   i will definitely see another play here
