i like their variety in products however they always have peddlers there asking for money and making people uncomfortable but they dont seem to do anything about it  also almost every single time i go to the pharmacy they never have my prescription ready even after theyve called me to tell me it was ready one day i called it in about  days early just to make sure i could stop by anytime before i ran out to pick up my prescriptionit turned out i wasnt able to pick it up until the day that i ran out anyway and even though i had called in three days earlier it still wasnt ready to add to this frustration i have gone in and waited for up to  hours for prescription to be ready when i was told it would only take  to  minutes lastly they have the automatic prescription refill when they call you to tell you that its ready when your prescription runs out i signed up for this however they didnt call me the last time i had a refillb ready because they werent aware it needed to be refilled and the time before that they called me to tell me it was ready and when i showed up it wasnt ready im sick of waiting here and eating my time for my prescriptions i am taking my business elsewhere
