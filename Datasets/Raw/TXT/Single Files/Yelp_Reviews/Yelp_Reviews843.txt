worst nights sleep i have ever had  not only was the mattress ridiculous stiff to where i ended up laying on the bed pillows and only got a couple hours of sleep  when i went down to the front desk at am to request a room change due to the mattress and i should really say i hobbled down due to being stiff  sore the front desk lady was unsympathetic and said that all the mattresss in the hotel are the same  she gave me no options and asked if i wanted to check out and of course offered no refund or discount  even going back up to my room to pack i encountered other guests who were complaining about the stiffness in their back from the mattress  do not go here  the breakfast location pool and fitness room nowhere near out way the amount of pain you will be in all day because of one nights stay  i wish i could give them a zero on yelp but alas i am forced to give them  star which they are undeserving of
