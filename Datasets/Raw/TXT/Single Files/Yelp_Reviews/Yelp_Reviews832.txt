lets just say this place is awesome my sister in law ordered that huge ol hot dog and shared it with  different people i had a bbq chicken salad and it was pretty good and a very decent size i wanted to take the cup home that they served our drinks it  it is a fun place to work out and if your kids are scared of dark make up i would definitely steer clear of this place but fun place to just enjoy a good lunchdrink or two
