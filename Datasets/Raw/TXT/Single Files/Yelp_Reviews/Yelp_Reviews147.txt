my girlfriend really hyped this place up but i ended up spending  on a terrible meal i couldnt even eat i ordered the chicken marsala waitresss favorite and it was disgusting the sauce was very over powering and it was drenched in it if that wasnt bad enough the chicken was cheap dark meat with the skin and the bones on it i ended up leaving even though our meals included a dessert with the price wont be going back here
