horrible college good luck going there or getting help when you needi it the only person i found to be helpful was brad and he simply shouldnt have to do anybodies job i will def be contacting higher management due to the lack of communication i have recieved i do not reccommend this school to anyone who is looking to further their education i have never seen such a horrible community college in my life time
