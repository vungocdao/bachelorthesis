so just finished my meal with my family here and i will not go back the waitress who i dont know her name because it was never shared was polite and efficient the only redeeming quality i found in the meal was my  glasses of wine not that the food was bad it just wasnt good i ordered moo shoo pork with  chinese pancakes once it arrived i was looking forward to it as the main dish looked appetizing then i opened my chinese pancakes omg they served me steamed tortillas i was expecting the crepe style chinese pancakes and instead i had flour tortillas steamed growing up and just having moved to pittsburgh from the west coast i know a tortilla when im served one and it wasnt even handmade freshly cooked tortillas that you get at a chain joint like chevys but pull em out of the bag from giant eagle tortilla this not only killed the meal but when the  tab came i was aghast my wife and two kiddos had decent meals but just because you serve large portions doesnt mean youre serving  dollars worth of food i felts cheated by high prices for mediocre chinese notice the little c food from a place that used to be rated as  great chinese restaurant but that was back in  as the plaques on the wall gleefully point ou
