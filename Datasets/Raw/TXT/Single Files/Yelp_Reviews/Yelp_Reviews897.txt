at  pm we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices only one seafood entree fish tacos on the entire  pg card was less than  and that included soups i didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos    entrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas which was a nice surprise  my son had the house specialty  camerones culuchi and i tried a flashfried whitefish served whole with sides for  bucks  we agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable my fish had about  pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish thats not an attempt at humor i can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard  oz can of tuna as if they extracted most of it for their own devices leaving me with little more than skin bones and an eyeball    its hardly a crummy place on the inside  the decor is cute and colorful  service seemed friendly if a bit confused and having grown up in new england  im aware seafood can be pricey  that said after tax and tip we spent  for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch in a hole in the wall just south of roosevelt   judging from the other reviews it sounds like we just came at a bad time but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back two stars for the ceviche
