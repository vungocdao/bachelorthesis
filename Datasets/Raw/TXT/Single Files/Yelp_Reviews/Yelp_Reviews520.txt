i wish i had read the previous review first  my boyfriend and i were craving a cajun chicken biscuit for breakfast so he picked it up and brought it home  the chicken was so dry hard and overcooked it was like chicken jerky  didnt even taste anything like it should  we were so disappointed so he called to tell the manager and she didnt offer us a better one or anything free next time  it was just a waste of  because we couldnt eat it  they probably wont get my business again
