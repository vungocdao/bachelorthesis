lemme be clear  i dont own a gun  im not into shooting guns or particularly even holding one  my hands shake and i start feeling nauseous but i gotta say after being in a few different gun shops for workthis place really takes the cake    i agree with dave s  that hyatt is a very highly respected shop  its in fact one of the top  largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country  one of the store employees even printed out the article to show me   youll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls in the casesand all the employees i talked to know their stuff inside and out  i was told the story behind machine guns and the history behind certain handguns    the place is almost always packed even on black fridaywhen they dont offer any discountssales and what i admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is  the fact the customers all wait patiently and dont get madnow thats loyalty
