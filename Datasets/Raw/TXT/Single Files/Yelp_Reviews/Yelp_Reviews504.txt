i ordered general tsos chicken and beef fried rice and both were vastly subpar the chicken was tangy and had an off taste the rice was soggy and the beef was over cooked  also it took a hour and a half for the food to show up and even the egg roll was only average i will not be ordering from this place ever again and i would strongly tell anyone i know not to order from there either
