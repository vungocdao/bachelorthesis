came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building no hostess no wandering servers no customers we had to search the place for someone to seat us and the first people we ran into were a couple of offduty servers who were rolling silverware the male kindly sat us and got our drinks for us it took a ridiculously long time for our server to even appear at our table and just as long for our food to come out to make everything worse the only other couple in the restaurant who were sitting behind us were complaining to the server about their food the server returned to their table a bit later no manager and said that the manager told him that since the food is made early in the day it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served what seriously it was hard to enjoy our food at all by the time it arrived  the food left much the be desired the service was the worst ive ever encountered i dont usually leave complaints on restaurant websites but i had to leave one for this terrible visit they gave us a coupon for a free appetizer needless to say we did not return to redeem it
