summary  beautiful hotel highly errorprone staff   it is rare to find a hotel as beautiful as this the look is very modern which i happen to love it has a decent gym which is also rare for a hotel there is a very soothing bar area with live gentle jazz music  the staff are very professional in demeanor and friendly  this could be an awesome place to stay   i experienced the following over two stays  i arrive pm exhausted from travel only to be told that the hotel is full  the only room they have left to offer me is half a parlor room i was given a sofa bed to sleep on i had made the reservation several weeks prior with guaranteed late arrival   i get to the room and the electronic key does not work i call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall  minutes half asleep for a guard to show up his key does not work either    ok this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels right    i gave a shirt and slacks to laundry that evening i receive someone elses underwear instead of my own clothes   i gave a pair of jeans to dry clean specifying not to wash because they would shrink well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size  a pattern develops  on the third night around pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door he claims to be security but show no identification  he wants to see my id  highly suspicious i dont open the door and i slip my gym copy of my license under the door later he returns with police and insists i accompany them to the front desk later they apologize for the error  what were they were thinking  a waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a  minute period the bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time   a gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen   the weather report button on the phone gives you a recording describing yesterdays weather  etcetera  bottom line  stay here for the serenity and beauty of the decor but you will need the patience of a saint
