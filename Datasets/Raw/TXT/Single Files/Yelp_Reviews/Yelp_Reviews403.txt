though im a copper enthusiast when it comes to getting my indian fix in charlotte id heard that maharani was a cheaper but tasty option so we ordered from there a few nights ago   copper is definitely still my place but maharani was fine enough first of all the food came very quickly which is rare usually indian food good indian good takes at least  minutes we got our order in like  which was great cause we were starving   the tikka masala was spicy and pretty good but it wasnt as thick and saucy as i like the salad was just soso the naan were all amazing definitely the highlight
