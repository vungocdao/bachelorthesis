went to a high tea here on sunday  although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming the food was nothing special in fact it was bad  we were served three tea sandwiches  egg salad which was bland i make a better version at home chicken salad nothing special either and then a delicious spinachartichoke bite  unfortunately it was the size of a quarter it was literally a bite  but it was the best part of the meal  i dont think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread  we were offered two types of scones  cranberry and eggnog   neither was anything special eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever  then the pastries  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was finenothing like vanilla pastry shop  a pumpkin torte again fine  and a chocolate moussebrownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on topit was dry as a bone  it looked as if it was on its last legschocolate was turning white mouse separated from brownie  yuck    oh yeahi had a delicious tea from harney and sons used to be sold at the grand floridian high tea in disney world cinnamon spice  unfortunately when i asked for more tea they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag   ive gone to various teas so i feel i can give a good comparison  not impressed at all  will not go back there ever
