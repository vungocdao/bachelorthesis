this is our first time coming to brixx and we really enjoyed it we ordered the pear and gorgonzola and the bronx bomber the  pear and gorgonzola was unique the bronz bomber had good flavor and a nice balance of ingredients personally i would have like them to be a little more crispy but thats just a personal preference   what i really liked was that the manager came to each table to introduce himself and make sure the customers were happy its rare to see managers touch tables great customer service and great food
