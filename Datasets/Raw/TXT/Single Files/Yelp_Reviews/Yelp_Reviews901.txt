when i want to go out but not spend  on entertainment and also get some exercise in at the same time and see some beautiful arizona landscape the desert botanical gardens is the best place i can go i enjoy walking around the garden looking at all of the flowers in bloom and all of the different kinds of cactus i also enjoy when they have different exhibits that you can see as you are wandering the garden i really enjoyed the chihuly glass artwork that was displayed a few years back   probably my favorite time of the year to come here is when they have the butterflies they are so pretty and this year there were so many of them we went this last weekend on my day off and the weather was perfect and we just had a great time i also get to brush up on my photography skills here the best because i can take some amazing pictures of flowers and butterflies   if you want to see what the arizona desert is all about you need to come here to experience it first hand its not only about dirt and cacti there are flowers galore as well
