best subs ever  seriously  we saw this on pa nat with dave and dave and it looks awesome  we took the drive to swissvale and got us a battleship and it was literally  feet long just the right amount of veggies and meat and delicious  it was  meals worth of food for two people  even better the next day  and the best part was that it was under  bucks    its great fast food  i cant wait to bring friends there to enjoy their selection of s along with a battleship
