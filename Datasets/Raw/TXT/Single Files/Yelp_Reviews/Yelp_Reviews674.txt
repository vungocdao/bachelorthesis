now thats what i call mediocre  im not a snob when it comes to chinese food at all ive experienced both unnecessarily authentic chinese cuisine and hyperamericanized chinese food and i will go for something inbetween every time  so this place seems like it will fit right in with that but it doesnt the service blows they have a  minimum charge for creditdebit cards  when i told them that was not allowed withiin their contracts with the credit card companies they gave me a blank stare i walked out  the couple of times i have eaten here i was not even mildly enthused about anything  the fried rice has no soy sauce flavor or any particular flavor at all it reminds me of those microwaveable rice cups the meat was chewy and decently flavored but the portion was pretty small not worth the price  dont worry theres about  asian restaurants on green st  im sure that youll find something
