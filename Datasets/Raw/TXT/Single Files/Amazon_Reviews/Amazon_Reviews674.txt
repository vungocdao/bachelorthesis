i read this book  years ago its still makes me highly agitated every time i think about it you just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end it has the worst ending ever it still pisses me off that i spent the time reading it there isnt really much of a story just a lot of details and weird issues there are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with any sort of common sense aside do not read if you are sensitive to rape that should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere not recommended
