i had expected or at least hoped for a more or less straightforward account of the mothman phenomenon of some  years ago instead this meandering book comprises hick ufo sightings that are only infrequently connected with mothman and keels trustmei knowwhatimtalkingabout theories and explanations i was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men in black behaving badly with little to recommend it and aside from providing some details on the mothman sightings theres no other recommendation the mothman prophecies is a considerable disappointment
