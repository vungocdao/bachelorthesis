i was very excited to see this movie available on amazon prime but i was disappointed once i started watching i really couldnt stand sams new model girlfriend she was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily i was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the decepticons were because they seemed very similar of course i must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if i had followed more of the transformers cartoon another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building theres foreshadowing when the nasa guy announces that theyre going to be taking refuge in a glass building what could possibly go wrong
