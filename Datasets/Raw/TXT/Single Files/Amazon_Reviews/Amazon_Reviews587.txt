as always gerard durrells works make me want to hop on a flight to greece right now his imagery of the lush flora and fauna there make it seem irresistible to anyone especially small boys though it was an enjoyable read it seemed a bit too similar to my family and other animals as though this sequel was everything he had forgotten to put into the first one which is exactly what the author states in the introduction this book seemed to focus a bit more on the animals less on the comical family and though sea life is fascination crustaceans do get a bit old this book is very relaxing to read and almost makes you feel like you are a little boy again slow paced and funny this enjoyable book put corfu at the top of my list of places to go
