it is jut an action figure you build and then you let it sit on the floor for months until it is stepped on what will this do for you all it does is make noises have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing but make a noise and just sits there after one day of being played with this has no education value for yugioh fans you should try buying yugioh tins instead of this crap
