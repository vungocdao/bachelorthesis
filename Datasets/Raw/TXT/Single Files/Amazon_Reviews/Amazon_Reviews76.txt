this novella stretched to  pages by wide margins and doublespaced lines reads like a screenplay treatment there is very little character development movielike dialogue and plenty of mindless action the ending is wholly unsatisfying and im led to believe that this is simply a setup for another book an author with some integrity would have placed edge of danger as part  of a part novelif you are deadset on reading edge of danger dont waste your money the cover price of is an insult and the deeply discounted  price will still leave you feeling rippedoff go to your local library in the morning and youll finish edge of danger in time for an early lunch just dont expect to have any appetite left
