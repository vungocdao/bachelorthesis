i rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things i had heard talked about it like that it was funny and romantic and had wonderful scenery what a disappointing storythe story had no sense of direction it seemed badly glued together as if the scriptwriters were saying well make her a divorced womanand then well make her go on a gay tourand oh wait lets make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasnt known for even one dayand lets make her flirt with the real estate man all in all the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character
