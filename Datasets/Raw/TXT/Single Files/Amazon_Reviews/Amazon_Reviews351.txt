i am surprised by how much i enjoyed this surprised and a little disappointed in my own taste but anywayyou know exactly what to expect from this movie explosions fightingand thats it luckily it delivers both of those in spades especially the splosions i have never seen so many things blow up every fifteen minutes john cena barely escapes some building blowing up and in slow motion of course the story is kelly carlson is kidnapped by robert patrick and john cena must rescue herrobert patrick is plain fantastic in this flick the filmmaker is smart as he gave the lions share of the line to mr patrick he plays a great sarcastic bad guy plain and simple john cena can act in the sense that arnold schwarzenegger can act mr cena lets his actions do the speaking thankfully plus hes a hottie sooverall just an easy cheesy blowemup action bmovie the extras are pretty lame though
