kunderas novel the unbearable lightness of being is absolutely amazing and this film falls so far short of it despite my almostimmediate dislike of the film i actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing hoping that daniel daylewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from kunderas book but i was sorely disappointedbut please read kunderas novel because it is wonderful i cant help but think that kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel immortality the present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films tv programs or cartoons what is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential
