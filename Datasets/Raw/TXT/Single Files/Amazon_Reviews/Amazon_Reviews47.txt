i was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to patricia cornwell well now i cant put her books down her books just get better and better as you go through the kay scarpetta seriesi really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book its nice to see the characters develop through each story line it allows you to get comfortable with them get close to them and get frustrated with them when they do something out of characteri highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire kay scarpetta series
