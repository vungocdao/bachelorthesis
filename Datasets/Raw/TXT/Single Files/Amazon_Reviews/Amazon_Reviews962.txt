so far i really like it its very informative and useful i would have given  stars but i have it on kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper its difficult to flip through the book and find what you need but i am fairly new to kindle so maybe its just me or old fashion enough to prefer a book in hand but i do recommend it in whichever form you prefer
