this product works well with no problems so far i have now had it for about a month and it keeps my ibook g running with no issues it doesnt have the light that indicates whether power is being received but thats a minor thing also doesnt have the easytouse cablewrapping things on the original but once again thats a mere quibble all in all i am satisfied with this purchase
