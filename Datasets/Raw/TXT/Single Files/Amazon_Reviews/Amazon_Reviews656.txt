yes by reading every review we all know by now that sheri is a wee bit annoying and her participants are an interesting sort of people and yes it did put my husband in a coma like trance everytime we watched it but everything in this dvd is so valuable i learned everything i needed to know through this dvd without taking more time off work to go to classes and since it was always available to me by the touch of a button i was able to review the important things while i was acually in labor i had to kill time waiting for my contractions to be  mins apart before we went to the hospital so i popped in the dvd and trust me my husband was no longer in a trance he was taking notes this was my first child and thanks to sheri my labor was only  hour and i only pushed for  mins  good ones and he was out i think doing what sheri says and waiting till your dialated  cm before you get an epideral was really key
