yes this has good graphics yes it has a kind of zelda theme but really if your looking for a game that fits the lord of the rings best then get the two towers once you are used to that then get the the return of the king that is the best game of them all ive played all three and the fellowship is by far the worst game i have  please gameboy dont let vivendi universal the makers of this game ever make a game based on a film ever again they wasted away all the good parts of the books and if you want to fight on this game then good luck to you do not buy this its a waste of money
