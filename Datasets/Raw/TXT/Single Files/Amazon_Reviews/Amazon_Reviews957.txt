this thing is ok but realize you must hold it onto your blow out port to make it work therefore you need  people to blow out your pipes when you are blowing out an rv constant air pressure is the key so saying that i ripped off the needle and attached an air chuck fitting to it now i just screw this on attach my air hose and pop on the compressor and i no longer need to hold it in place
