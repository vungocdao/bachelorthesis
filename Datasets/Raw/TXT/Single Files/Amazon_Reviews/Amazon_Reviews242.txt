once i recovered from the eye strain at the tiny print i realized id just read an earth shattering book on wicca and witchcraft taken in hand with all the books with bad history this book fixes them all just rip out the history section in every book you have and glue this book in its placeit is unapologetically modernistic with the sources to back it upexcellent really excellent
