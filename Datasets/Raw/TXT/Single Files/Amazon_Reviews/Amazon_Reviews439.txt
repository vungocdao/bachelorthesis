i got a huge kick out of vinnys interpretations of the beatles songs that they never recorded sure they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped as has been written here but the dont mimic previous covers but try to recreate the early beatle sound its light and its fun its is not a must have as a beatles fan but i think youll get a big kick out of this disc
