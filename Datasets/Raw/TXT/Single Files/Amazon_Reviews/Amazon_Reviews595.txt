i love her books so much this movie is an absolute insult the original story was so wonderful i cant understand why the film makers thought they were making something better and ed what about ed geez i could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms foolishly thinking that the movie would get better and after that i was done another good thing about dvds is that you dont have to be kind and rewind it would have be a waste of electricity and my vcr this movie is right up there with ishtar except worse
