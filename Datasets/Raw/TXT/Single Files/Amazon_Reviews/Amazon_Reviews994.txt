i bought this bed recently for my  year old lab mix he doesnt dig chew or abuse things in any way so i wasnt concerned with getting a super abuseproof bed but after a couple of weeks of limited use i found a hole in the soft side of the bed the fact that this side attracts hair is unfortunate but a hole being made almost immediately makes this bed not worth buying it may have been a decent design if it was made with sturdy materials very disappointing
