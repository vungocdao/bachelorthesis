although i prefer books with an actual plot i dont mind reading choppy journaltype entries if there is actually a point to all of it or if at least such entries are entertaining this books are albeit only in the beginning after a while youll begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if thats just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing stylethis book wasnt worth the timeor the title theres hardly anything about the mothman in it
