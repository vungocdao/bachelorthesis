i am sorry but after reading this book i have to admit that the feminists are right men are pigs and the only reason this book was written was for the authors to make moneythe book tries to justify its existance by saying it is designed to help you find the love of your life on the internet it actually only helps you find the love of your night if i had actually used any of the tips in the book i would have had alot of sex but i doubt finding my soulmate would have been possible in fact i doubt anyone using this tips would find their ultimate mate it would be inspite of the tips not because of theman entire chapter is devoted to sterotyping women though the authors do try to explain most women do not meet these types then the list over  to watch out fori am glad i did not actually pay for this i would have demanded my money back
