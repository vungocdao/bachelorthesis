this is a very disapointing book the author makes the complexe amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at nickle mine school into one diminsional disney characters there is no tension conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real just a oh so sweet group of simple peopleof course that does not allow us to learn anything from the amish and i am sure there is a lot to be learn from themthe author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the amish there were spots where i though o please get over yourself i didnt finish the book it was a waste of time
