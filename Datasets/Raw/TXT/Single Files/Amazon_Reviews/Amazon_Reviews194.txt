i am a big belva plain fan and have always enjoyed her books after the fire is a disappointing read what bothered me the most is the character of hyacinthwhat a weak and stupid woman she is not believable at all any mother will fight to the end for her children i kept hoping she would snap out of it but she never did she just kept trusting stupid men and believing them i will think twice before spending money on another belva plain novel in the future
