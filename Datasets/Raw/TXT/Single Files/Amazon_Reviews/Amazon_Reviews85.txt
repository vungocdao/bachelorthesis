this review refers to isbn  with no explanation or indication that it is doing so this edition leaves out the authors introductory chapter the customhouse admittedly the chapter is long tedious and skipped by many still it leaves the book useless for the classroom and lets face it who else is going to read it this isnt exactly light summer readingin addition there is no bolding of sat words with definitions in the margins that some reviewers mention which was the main reason i chose this edition in fact other than the abbreviated text there is absolutely nothing no forward no readers guide no author bio  nothing so not the most helpful textbookon the bright side it is wellbound and the type is quite easy to readi am returning the book and looking for a more suitable edition
