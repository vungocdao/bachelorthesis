the author is very likely a kurdish nationalist not implausibly a quite supporter of the pkk as a communist he has no room for religion his analysis is misleading basically he runs after muslims under the banner of islamism he seeks to undermine the islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs the author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that islam does not work the author does not use objective scientific methods he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions read the book if you wish but with such qualifications in mind you may read it to understand how the bigots mind actually works
