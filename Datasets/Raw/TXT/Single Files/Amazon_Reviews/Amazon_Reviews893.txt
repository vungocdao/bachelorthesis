i ordered this bag without any knowledge of how big it was i wanted to use it for a wkend trip i was taking and was shocked at how small the bag was i have a  month old baby girl and it was way too small for me to carry all of her things in it i was only able to fit a few diapers and wipes and the other small items i wasnt even able to fit a change of clothes i tried putting a change of her clothes in the back pocket but it made it way too bulky all in all the bag was adorable but way too small for a newborn i wouldnt recommend this bag to any mother with a newborn baby
