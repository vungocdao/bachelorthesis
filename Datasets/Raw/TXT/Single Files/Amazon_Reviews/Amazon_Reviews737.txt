i just read this for the first time at  wow what an eye opener the things orwell predicted in  such as the technology is amazing considering how long ago it was written the politics are messed up by current standards but frighteningly possible the tense mood of the book draws you in and there are moments especially near the end that would be truly terrifying to experience the chapter with room  i read with a shudderthe reason i didnt give it  stars is because it bogs down a few times i understand that this is to explain the world and how such a horrific existence came to be but a slow start to any book is rather annoying
