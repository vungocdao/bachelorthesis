the plotstoryline was not cohesive the movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life making a movie longer is not making a movie better in fact if the movie is weak making it longer just makes the point even more painfully obviousi kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the casemaybe dreamworks will just move on to another projectsave your money if you intend to buy better rent and save the rest for a better movie
