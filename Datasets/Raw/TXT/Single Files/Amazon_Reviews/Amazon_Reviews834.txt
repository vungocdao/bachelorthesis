i give this book two stars because its the first and last book to tell us what we already should knowthat we think gibberish in that ethereal state between waking and sleep finningans wake reminds me of the canvas ive seen at countless art shows with a jumble of random splatterings of paint any one of us could create the same thing why dont we joyce is challenging us to get off our duffs and splatter some paint on the canvass if you think its worthwhile personally i dont do it you could be the next james joyce
