the first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history its enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages unfortunately the book becomes one of the most overrated in historymany of the praises given say the book is difficult confusing and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book why why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good this is a parable with many characters magic realism a genre that deserves to be ignored though thats another discussion to give marquez credit his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under but it is nevertheless a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful and the intertwining of lives but they just dont move the story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all aboutmarquez book about miguel litton and news of a kidnapping are much better but this book just bores and bores
