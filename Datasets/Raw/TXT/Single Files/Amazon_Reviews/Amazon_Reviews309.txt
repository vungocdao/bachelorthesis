the movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book i told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me big mistake in the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes in the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations void of philosophy and psychology
