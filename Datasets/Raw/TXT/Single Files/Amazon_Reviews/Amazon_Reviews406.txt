there is not one redeemable quality about this film period nicolas cage is at the bottom of the barrel he now has absolutely no range the acting in this was worse than a low budget b movie i think he seriously was on something so here we are new orleans post katrina nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble i couldnt figure out who was coming or going i was baffled the entire movie the lines were horrible please save your money
