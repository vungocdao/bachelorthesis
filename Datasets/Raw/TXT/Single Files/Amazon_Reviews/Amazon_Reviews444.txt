i had to try sleeping on it the first night  in a couple of hours it was less firm which made it difficult to roll around on it didnt take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistakereturning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough prospective buyers should be mindful of this
