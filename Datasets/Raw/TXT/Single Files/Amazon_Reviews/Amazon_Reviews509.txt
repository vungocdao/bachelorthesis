not everyone can like every album but for me one second is my alltime favorite i have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers one second is different from yellos other albums and in my opinion doesnt hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno while the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there and brilliantly done the sound is less annalog and has more feel it is not background music but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed the latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for shirley basseys style and voice in my mind this album creates its own genre of music which i have yet to find elsewhere it is different but it is very very good
