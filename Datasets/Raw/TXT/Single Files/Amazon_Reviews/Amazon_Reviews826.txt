certain songs from naglfar are without a doubt outstanding esp th rising brimstone gate but the songs off of vittra all sound similar i cant really decipher between them most of the riffs arent capturing it is hard to find the cd diabolical which has the songs i mentioned above but already i can tell you that cd is better than vittra
