there are many better yoga dvds to choose from as a surfer there is no special surf yoga as opposed to regular yoga any surfer who takes the time to practice yoga will benefit peggys videos lack the vital instruction that beginners need to do poses properly without injury it is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community a better option is shiva rheas shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction and a yoga matrix which allows you to create your own unique routines most dvds become stale after awhile but the yoga matrix on shiva rheas dvd in addition to the  readymade routines prevent this dvd from ever getting old
