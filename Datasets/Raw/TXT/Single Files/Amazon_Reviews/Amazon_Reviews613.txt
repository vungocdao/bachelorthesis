i bought two of the s two years ago and actually fell in love with the machine  despite the tv guide debacle blame cable companies on that not the manufacturers after a year and a half the first one stopped working best i can tell the hard drive just failed the cost for fixing makes it smarter to buy a new one  so i trashed it a few months later the second one stopped working altogether also i absolutely love the machine but there is obviously some problme with the hard drives i am waiting until pioneer replaces this line  to buy a better one dont know why there is so little to choose from in the industry for this type of product
