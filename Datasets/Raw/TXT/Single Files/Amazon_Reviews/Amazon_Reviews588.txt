quite often bringing a classic story like moby dick to the screen is a thankless task but at least john hustons  version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances even moby dick looked a lot more realistic in  this version just doesnt make it  skip it and buy a copy of gregory pecks rendition instead youll be glad you did
