this book could be useful if the examples actually worked i have barely reached the th page and all ready i have found more errors than should be allowed in an entire book the examples are misquoted and several dont work the book might be more helpful if the proof reader knew enough on the subject to correct the more obvious errors if you buy this book be ready to experiment with the syntax which may be close but not always correct
