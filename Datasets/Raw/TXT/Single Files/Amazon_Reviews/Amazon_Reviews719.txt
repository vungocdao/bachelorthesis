this book is a total waste of time to read i couldnt wait to read it when i saw it on amazoncom but lucky for me i happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick to think that she thinks scott fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal she will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like fischer or rob hall save your money on this one i have read almost everything about mount everest and the  tragedy and this is by far the worst it will never compare with into thin air or the climb also she has a style of writing that i have never seen before she jumps from one thing to another but i can guarantee you it will always be about herself and how strong and great she is
