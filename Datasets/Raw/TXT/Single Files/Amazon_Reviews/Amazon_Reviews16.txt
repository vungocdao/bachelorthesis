this is an awesome game almost everyone know tictactoe so it is easy to learn and quick to play you cant play just once the twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes  just big enough to gobble up your opponent the first person to make tictactoe wins but its not as easy as it looks when youre stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities my  and  year olds will beat me even when im trying to win excellent beginning critical thinking game grandparents loved playing it with the kids too
