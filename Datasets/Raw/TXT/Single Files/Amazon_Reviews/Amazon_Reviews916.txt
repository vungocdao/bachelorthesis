this is what i think my problem is i didnt like the translation of the book if the novel was written in spanish and then translated into english i would sit there and say to myself that i loved the descriptive but not the flow of the sentence i am compelled to give this novel another try based on these reviews it has been a few years and i feel it is well deserving
