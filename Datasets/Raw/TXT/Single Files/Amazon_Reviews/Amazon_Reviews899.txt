this is the second part of a two part series and picks up where jean de florette leaves off if you do not see jean de florette then you will be missing much of the background of this movie and the context is important for example without viewing the first movie the viewer will not know manons background what happened to her father and their farm the viewer will also not know the full relationship she has with the soubeyran clanthe quality of the dvd picture is avarage the picture is fairly clean and clear
