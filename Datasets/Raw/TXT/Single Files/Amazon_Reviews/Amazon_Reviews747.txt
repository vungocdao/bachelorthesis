ok maybe mr orwell intended it to be this way but it still doesnt hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the authors other works i read this book because i remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding animal farm years ago and this work was recommended by several of my friends if you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing check this out yes this is science fiction and just because some people call it a classic doesnt mean i like it if you want some of the best in this genre i recommend dune by frank herbert  a space odyssey by arthur c clarke or enders game by orson scott card
