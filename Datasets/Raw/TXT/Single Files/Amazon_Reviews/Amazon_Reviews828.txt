i was new to guanajuato and enjoyed the parts of the book the discuss the city but the story line was trite even contrived the culinary part of the mystery included recipes that while tasty are hardly gourmet  they mostly consisted of things made with campbells soup not one that i recall was indigenous to mexico at least it was a quick read
