we bought this emer galilieo vacuum cleaner for about  more than one year ago the retractable cord broke after a short time we had to send the vacuum to nj to get it repaired by using the warranty after a month they sent it back with the same problem and the onoff button was broken as well i called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one this vacuum is very powerful however the handle hose is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use by considering its high price i guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner
