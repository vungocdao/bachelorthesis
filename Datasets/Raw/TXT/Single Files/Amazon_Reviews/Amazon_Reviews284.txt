i love these anchor hocking glasses my parents have had a set of this pattern for years when i moved into my own place in college and was tired of the free plastic cups i had i went to the store and found these glasses i have  big glasses in a blue color but im wanting matching in a smaller glass and cant seem to find the same color anyway i really like that the squares help you hold the glass easier also these glasses are very stable dont tip easily plus they are bottom heavy but not too bottom heavy that way they dont slip out of your hands as easily i have broken many other glasses cause they were too bottom heavy but i have never broken one of these
