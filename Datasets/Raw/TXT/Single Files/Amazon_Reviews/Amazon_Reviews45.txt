i have read all of the carpathian novels to date except one i very much enjoyed them at first but nothing ever gets resolved you would think that after  books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced as for this book it is an offshoot of another carpathian novel about the jaguar line i was hoping to find out more about this curse the origins and why the males kill the females nothing not a word about the jaguar curse and why do the walls and ceilings change ideas introduced and left at that ms feehan went once again off on a tagent her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive i will not be buying any further books by this author what a shame
