a truly horrible horror film over use of not so special special effects attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum and that the characters were never developed or interesting the only thing thats scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after  years the other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that i actually paid to see it
