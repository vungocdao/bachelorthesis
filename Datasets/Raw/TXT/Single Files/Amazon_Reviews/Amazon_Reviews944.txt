garbage is a band like no other you really have to take a listen to this amazing band to realize how one incorporates so many styles into one little albumthis album is packed full of classic garbage songs that can really give you the chills the opening track temptation waits was very eerie the first time i heard it and i loved it the next track i think im paranoid has that heavy bass and light vocals that the band is known for love the lyrics tooa great album for anyone looking to continue digging thru garbage a word of advice thoughdont bother with beautifulgarbage if you are a rock fandefienatley not impressive
