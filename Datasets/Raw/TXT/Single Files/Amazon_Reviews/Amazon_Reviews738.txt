im surprised that noam chomsky hasnt been mentioned in any of the  previous reviews nineteen eightyfour is not just a supreme work of art it is politically relevant because the phenomena identified by orwell doublethink newspeak etc are in various forms actively used today in even the freest societies chomsky gives very detailed descriptions of this ive repeatedly found he says that when the audience is mostly poor and less educated i can skip lots of the background  because its already obvious and taken for granted by everyone curious
