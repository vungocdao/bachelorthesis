okay i had to read this book for a fantasy lit class i am taking my teacher and all of my fellow classmates it seems find it hilarious i however am left wondering whyi understand what hes getting at with religion and what not ive just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors the characters are boring and flat his humor is downright stupid this book is not clever in the least if you dont know the things hes pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty you really need to think for yourselfi guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel but then the back of the book does say he is a popular author and like most things that are popular it must be accessible to the public or else they wont understand
