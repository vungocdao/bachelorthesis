after a little over a year my zen xtra has stopped playing sound everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on creatives players on a dinky  portable i wouldnt expect much but on a  device this is just unacceptabletheir warranty period and customer service is a joke go have a look at their forums stay away from creative products there are other alternatives out there
