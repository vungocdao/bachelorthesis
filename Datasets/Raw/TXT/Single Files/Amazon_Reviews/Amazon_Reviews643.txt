i really have to give this author credit as far as being able to be so objective in writing about her cousins killers and the police detectives who forced a confession from her innocent brother the book presents its facts on the case leaving us to our own conclusions what is so ironic about the case is that the cousins were going to the old chain of rocks bridge to read an antiracism poem written by one of the victims only to be brutally murdered by a gang of the minorities that she was probably referring toa very fast and good read
