let me start by saying that i never put down a book even if i dont like it this is one that i couldnt even get past the first few pages maybe i didnt give it a chance but the foul language and vile event depicted in the first few pages turned me off completely to this book im glad it was a free download on kindle i gave it two stars only because i didnt give it a chance to get better if i hadnt deleted it maybe i would give it another chance but i certainly wont pay for it
