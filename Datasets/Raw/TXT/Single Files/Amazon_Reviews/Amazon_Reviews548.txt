unfortunatelly the dvd is dissapointing for tinas fans the show is fantastic but both dolby digital and dts version of this dvd have one of the worst sounds i ever heard my subwoofer didnt move once while the tweeters of the front speakers nearly went on flames more the soundtrack was reedited with sound taken from other concerts thats incredible  at one moment i swear that i heard the word munchen despite the fact that the concert is in amsterdam and oh yes the dvd is overpriced forget amsterdam and dont miss one last time in concert as it has verry good sound quality and image not speaking abut the phantastic show
