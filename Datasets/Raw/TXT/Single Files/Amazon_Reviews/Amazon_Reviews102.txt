the early success of adam sandlers films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer this film proves he is neither  and a grating voiceover guy to boot i enjoyed happy gilmore and to a much lesser degree little nicky and big daddy but sandler is a onetrick pony weve all seen the trick so its just not interesting anymore i thought this might be the one hanukah film in a world of xmas fare it has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids
