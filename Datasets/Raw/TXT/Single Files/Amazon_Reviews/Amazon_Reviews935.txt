i bought this movie because i love jerry bruckheimer movies i should have just rented it the only entertaining part of this movie was the bar scenes all of which were shown in the trailer that about sums up the good scenes when i watched the featurette about how hard they were looking for a lead actress and how excited they were to find piper perabo i couldnt believe it perabos acting was so annoying she ruined the whole movie for me her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded i just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling im one of those people who like all kinds of movies even some really bad ones but this is one that i dont think i will be watching again
