i knew nothing of robert mcduffie until i heard him perform the mendelssohn concerto at wolf trap with the national symphony that performance led me to seek out this cd and mcduffies playing here is as lovely on the disc as it was in the live performance his tone may not be as big as itzhak perlmans but it is nevertheless exquisite the phrase spun silver though cliched is apt this is true concerto playing the soloist carrying on a conversation with the orchestra and by extension with the listener i definitely will seek out more of mcduffies discs and i hope others will too
