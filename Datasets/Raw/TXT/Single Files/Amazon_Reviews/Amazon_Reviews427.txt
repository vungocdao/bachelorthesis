this is a very funny movie that stars martin short as murray a bumbling fairy godmother who can hardly do anything right his first job is helping anabel greening played by mara wilson anabels wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical and she wants him to get the part unfortunately murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue when anabel her brother charlie and murray go to nafgaa and tell the queen of the fairy godmothers what happened she tells anabel that if they dont reverse the spell by midnight he will remain a statue forever before they can do that they have to get the wands back from the evil claudia i highly recommend a simple wish
