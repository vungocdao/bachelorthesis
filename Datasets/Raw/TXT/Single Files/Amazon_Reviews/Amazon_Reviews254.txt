let me just start by saying that the  mothman prophecies is not a novel nor is it a coherent story it starts strong just enough to draw you in then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole were led to believe that mr keel is a sensiable unbiased investigator when really hes a parinoid delusional whack im only  and i dont buy a word of it see the movie instead
