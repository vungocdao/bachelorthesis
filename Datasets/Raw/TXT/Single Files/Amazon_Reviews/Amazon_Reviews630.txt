the only type of person to whom i could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a forest level view of them from one source there is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability the series from the gesell institute your one year old your two year old etc etc provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages raising your spirited child is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child i am saddened and more than a bit annoyed i purchased the book on the basis of the organizations recommendation that the american academy of child  adolescent psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight
