buena vista the company that releases disney films on dvd chose to not release anamorphic dvds when they first came to dvd so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced this means if you have a widescreen television you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture also these discs are absolutely barebones only featuring a dolby  soundtrack and a  widescreen presentation where are the extras i dont know about you guys but i am a mighty duck fan who is disappointed by the dvd release of this film
