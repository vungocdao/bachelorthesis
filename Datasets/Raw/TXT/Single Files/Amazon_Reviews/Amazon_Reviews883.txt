a fan of both jacksons novel and the  robert wise adadptation i went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming it was worse in fact it was so bad i laughed my way through it along with the two friends who accompanied me there are so many digital effects that the house seems alive indeed but computer geeks set free with a big budget dont creep me out theyre just annoying so is the movie the house shapeshifts sighs moanshell even the doorknocker gets a reaction shot zetajoness leather hipboots manage to outact her and lili taylor is hilariously bad as eleanor ive got the save the children wha liam neeson is even less interesting than he was in the phantom menace if thats possible lets just put it this way i just sacrificed  minutes of my time to write this review so that you wont waste  hour and  minutes of yours on this film
