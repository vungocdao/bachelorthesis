i thank god for the writer of this book this book explains new insight on jesus parables taking in consideration of the lords geographical location and cultureit took me a while to read this book why because this is the type of book that you may want to meditate after reading it its not something that you read and let bygones be bygonsthis book particularly focuses on what our actions should be as jesus followers it addresses issues like greed or mesociety that we often ignore id like to stress out that jesus pointed everything plainly for us this book only reminds us to go back and look deeper within ourselves and question if god is really what motivates us in everything we doi love this book and will give it to friends i know please pray for me so i can share it to others as well and also put the jesus words into actionthank god
