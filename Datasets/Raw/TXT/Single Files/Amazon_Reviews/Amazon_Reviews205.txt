great this is a kent henry praise and worship classic  you can not go wrong with this one do not sleep on kent henry ive mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders this man is gifted anointed and sings many spontanious praise and worship songs although there are no spontanious songs on this one his cds from his independent labels are loaded with them he has a talent for ushering believers into gods presencethe songs are a mixture of upbeat and mellow classics this is a must have this cd is out of print and if you can get your hands on one  do it quickly
