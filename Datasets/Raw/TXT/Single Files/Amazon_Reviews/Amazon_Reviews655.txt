very simply i was unable to put this book down not unlike some of the other reviewers i too was on my way to boston on business whilst reading this glued to my seat book for the first time i can say that i was pleased for all the flight delays as i managed to finish reading this book on route i am an avid reader and can say without reservation that rapid descent was easily as good as any of the books being written by some of the better known authors such as crichton grisham cook etc to name a few of my favorites well done dr jack whens the next one
