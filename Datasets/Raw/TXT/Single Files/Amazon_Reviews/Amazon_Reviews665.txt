thank goodness i borrowed this from the public library and didnt waste my money my husband and i did attend live classes but wanted a refresher before the big event while the information is consistent with what weve learned from other professionals  the presenter is terribly annoying although we wanted the information the jokes were so unbearable we had to stop watching if you can deal with the presenters sense of humor youll benefit from the information  good luck
