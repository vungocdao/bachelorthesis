i bought garbages first album first and i thought the album was great boasting good tracks like milk queer only happy when it rains but the sophomore album was even better temptation waits started out with mansons menacing voice with simplistic lyrics like i tell you something i am a wolf but i like to wear sheeps clothing the second track had a rockier edge to it and then slowed down with medication and then it was fun all the way till you look so fine which ended the album with a sombre note like how garbage ended its first title with milka great buy almost perfection  you will just repeat it again and again without losing interest
