my  year old son received this as a christmas gift once it was initally setup he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger very gentle however after  rounds of play we were unable to get the teeth to pop back up or to get the rest of the teeth to push down needless to say he was very disappointed as was i does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one
