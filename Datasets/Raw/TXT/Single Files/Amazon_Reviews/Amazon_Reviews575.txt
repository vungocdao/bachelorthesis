they look cheep and feel cheep and well they are cheep but they dont work which is the bottom line fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a bucks for falls out of your ear its not worth it since jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the jawbone which fit your snugly in your ear they also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you so this product fails and had id seen them in person i wouldnt have spent my money on them
