i organize all my files into folders however this device ignores my classification and sort all files by artist and album there is no way to configure the device so i can browse my music through my foldersmoreover there is no easy way to create a playlist to do that you have to install the software that cames whith it and you can not add new musics to the playlist in another computer all playlists editions must be done in the same computer this is a huge limitation for me because i use a lot of different computers home office notebook i havent bought an ipod because it has the same limitations futhermore the software that comes with it is terrible much worst than itunesso if you organize your files into folder and would like to use this classification in your mp player and if you dont want to buy an ipod because you will be tied on in a specific computer you should not buy this device
