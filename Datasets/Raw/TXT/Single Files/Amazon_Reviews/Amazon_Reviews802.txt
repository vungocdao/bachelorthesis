this is very interesting film that is really five stories in one a dead girl is found and each story is effected by this in one way or another a great cast and honest dialogue make this one well worth your time the film is ultimately sad and depressing but each story is very interesting with a cast featuring toni collette giovanni ribisi piper laurie and many other talents how can you go wrong
