ive read a tremendous amount on the subject of ww ii history so very rarely do i read a book with anything new to tell me this book is in that class and wellwritten too the two points i found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of hitlers  campaign in russia and the first extensive history ive read about the airlift effort to save paulus th army trapped at stalingrad he offers original research into  the question of just who promised hitler that the luftwaffe could sustain th army by airlift and just how successful the soviets were in interfering with the airlift for anyone interested in the history of ww ii on the eastern front this book is a must read
