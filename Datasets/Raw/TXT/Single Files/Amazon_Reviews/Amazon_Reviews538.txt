after roughly a year of fairly reliable use ive also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack now im wondering what to do with an item that i paid nearly  because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago limited being somewhat of an understatement no one should ever have to consider fixing and possibly further marring something they paid that much money fora month ago i wouldve given this item four stars after coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that creative continues to neglect im outright angry that im not alone
