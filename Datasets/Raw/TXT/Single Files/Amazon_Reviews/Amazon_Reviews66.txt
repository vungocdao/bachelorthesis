i think this product provided a great fit i was able to hook on the first row by myself within about  mins max it wasnt quite as difficult to get on as i thought it might be although it isnt particularly easy either i tried it on and wore for about  hours and then the nd time i wore it had it on for about the same period of time i took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom this product is far too expensive to have something like that happen the fit on me was snug but i am sure i had the correct size now i have to figure out how to get this resolved
