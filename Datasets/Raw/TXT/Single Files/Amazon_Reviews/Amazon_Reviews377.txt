i love my photosmart  but was a little discouraged when the driver for xp was not available the neat thing about this printer is if you mainly use it to print photos from a memory card you dont have to be connected to your pc just know which numbers you want to print enter and off it goes the quality of my prints has been great right now its connected to my imac and is doing splendidly its quite dependable and not expensive id recommend it highly
