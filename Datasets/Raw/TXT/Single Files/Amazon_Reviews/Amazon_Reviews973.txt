as other reviewers have suggested this book is full of errors i used this book along with the official guide and the rea book which is much better for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless there are so many errors that i found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that i didnt already know to be accurate which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide many of the mistakes are obvious but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in errorthis book is not worth the time
