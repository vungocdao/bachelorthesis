i had bought one of these for my old dog a large german shorthaired pointer who had a horrible pulling problem and it worked perfectly for him and he didnt seem to mind on the other hand i just bought one of these for my  month old coonhound and it also worked to stop his pulling but he hates it i cant take him for a walk without him trying to get it off atleast  times i think this may just be because he loves to sniff the ground so much that this kind of makes his head go higher up but now i have to order him something else to stop his pulling because of what difficulty it is to use this for him other than that amazing product in its self
