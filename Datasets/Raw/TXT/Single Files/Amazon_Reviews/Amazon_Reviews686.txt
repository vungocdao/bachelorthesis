the kindle version has no illustrations and the formatting makes it hard to read and enjoy the verses the limericks appear without logical line shifts and where the illustration is supposed to be it just says illustration which is a lot more annoying than not having anything there at allits free but its hard to read and that kind of takes the fun out of it at least for me
