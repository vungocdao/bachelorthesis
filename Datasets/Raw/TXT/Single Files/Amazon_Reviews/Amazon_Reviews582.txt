ive seen better movies on the all news channel odysseus was played very well but his part was boring as well as the rest of the movie scylla looks like s cartoonsi drew better stuff in st gradeevery single scene looks so fake it isnt even funny i can probably get more entertainment watching an earthworm i would not recommend this to anyone young or old this movie isnt worth a penny in my book
