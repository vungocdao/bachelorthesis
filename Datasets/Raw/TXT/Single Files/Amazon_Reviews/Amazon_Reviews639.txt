this is the first time i post a review because i am compelled to do soi bought this camera to use during the christmas holidays i tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the christmas tree all i saw was complete darkness then i realized that i needed more light so i turned on all the lights in the house and it was still darkness if you plan to use this camera indoor please forget about it no wayit isnt that great outdoor neither i took many pictures with the automatic exposure setting it cannot handle anything with a bright background it will just be very brighti tried to use it on the ski slopes i think it is because of the cold temperature the camera has to be reset often to make the matter worse the pictures turned out literally twistedi cant belive a hp camera can have so many flaws very disappointing please dont buy one
