if you purchase this data cable you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works as directed i downloaded all of the files from the se site mb on dial up and then downloaded all of the user guides everything seemed to install ok but nothing would make my phone be recognized after that i scoured the se site for troubleshooting info on their branded cablein the hope that something would help me figure out the problem after  full days of beating my head against the wall i finally threw the cable and the useless cd that came with it in the trashif i had used my brain i would have paid the extra  for a se branded cable and software and the support that comes along with that i now have the real deal se data cable and software and guess what yep installation was a breeze and it works beautifully you really do get what you pay for
