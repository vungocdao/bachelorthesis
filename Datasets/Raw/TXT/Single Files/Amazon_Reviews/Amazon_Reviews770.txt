i dont give very many things five starsbradburys novel is simple powerful beautiful and truly marvelousa negative utopia along the lines of brave new world or  i like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately utterly hopeful bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressiveyou know the plot  they burn books because theyre scared of ideas montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society this book makes me want to change the world and so i want you to read it and then maybe memorize ita quick read and a fairly easy read engrossing enough that you wont want to put it down and once you finish it you might be tempted to just start over and read it again i recommend doing just that
