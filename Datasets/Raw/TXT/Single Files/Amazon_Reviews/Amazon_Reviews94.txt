although this book is considered a great work of literature written to describe the harshness of purtian new england plus this book was heavily laiden with symbolism and many other literary toolsthe scarlet letter is a soap opera and a bad one at that not only is it boring no true action occurs in this book nothing truly interesting happens in this book this boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison dooralthough the author did a creative job of conveying his point this is still the worst book i have ever read i would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first  pages this is a good book to study however it is not a good book to read for pleasure under any circumstance
