this book is simply great if you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize html and present its syntax willynilly this book is the only book ive ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup it explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook html with other technologies without trying to teach cgi css etc at the same time the only thing i wish is that this guy would write a javascript or dhtml book id buy that right away
