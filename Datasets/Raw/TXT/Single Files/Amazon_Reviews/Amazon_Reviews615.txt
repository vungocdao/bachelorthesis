these run very large and do not fit correctly because of this however for the price i still think they are a great bargain they are very heavy duty and will probably last many years they are also very warm almost too warm here in southen california those people in cold climates would love them anyhow i would be giving five stars except for the mismatched fit but i just tucked it in really good and they stay on the bed just fine
