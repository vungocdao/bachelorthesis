this is a very nice tripod is strong elegant and cool i love it but the only trouble that i find it it is that this cool gadget does not have a detail list of compatible sony cameras i mean i am an owner of  sony cybershot cameras the w and h and i am not able to use the remote control with my cameras only because sony do not give us that information
