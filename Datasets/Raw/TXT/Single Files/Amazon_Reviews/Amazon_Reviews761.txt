exit to eden is one of annes best works in my opinion many people were turned off by the film adaptation why hollywood decided no one would want to see a bondage film is beyond me eg but this book focuses on the relationship of master and slave and what happens when the tables are turned anne has many sides and lestat is just one of them true rice fans will adore this beautiful work of fiction
