this card has to be the bast purchase ive ever made the grapghics are great its directx supported a biggie and is far superior to most cards of the same price the reviewer who says it doesnt work obviously knows nothing about computers to know well enough whether his motherboard will work with the card if he bought the agp card maybe he should try the pci anyway this is a great video card from a great company for a great price buy it
