the manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed and the pole in the center of the tree was bent beyond redemption i have no idea how this tree looked all put together since i had to repack it and send it back thankfully amazoncoms return policy is generous and swift  they get five stars for service in the meantime it was a real tree for me again this year    i may try to go with an artificial one next year but will not order one online again
