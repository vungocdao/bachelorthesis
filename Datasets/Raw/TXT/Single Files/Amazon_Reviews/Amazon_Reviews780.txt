being only a teenager what i have to say usually means nothing or gets no credit i personally loved this book reading it just a day ago i was entirely captivated with the plot and the idea of censorship in the future and that it was precise that it being a book would be censored is unbelievable what possesses any person to censor a book that is so realistic it is amazing to actually prove to the writer that his writings are so precise is astonishing i would recommend this to anyone you dont need to love to read just know how to read
