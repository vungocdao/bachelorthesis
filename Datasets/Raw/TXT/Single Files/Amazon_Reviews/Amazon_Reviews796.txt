i first read this book for an english assignment at school after reading the first few pages i was completely lost bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic it is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot definetly not the greatest book in the world personally i hated the book
