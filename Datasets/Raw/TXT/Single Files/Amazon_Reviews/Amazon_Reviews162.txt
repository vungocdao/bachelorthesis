as a child i grew up in knoxville tn watching dolly partin on the cas walker farm  home show i remember her singing bluegrass back then and didnt really appreciate what i was hearing unfortunately she got away from her roots now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted cd that has critics and her fans screaming her praises dollys voice is perfectly suited to singing bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark the arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable as a tenneseean i wish she would have included her awesome version of rocky top or at least updated it dollys gonna give a lot of fellow artists a run for their money this year at the grammys with the grass is blue and trio ii a top  cd if i ever heard one
