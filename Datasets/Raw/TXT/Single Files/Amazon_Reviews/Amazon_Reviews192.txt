these may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not the magnet that is glued to the back of these is about  and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder i tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator if you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger stronger magnet  these hooks will be useful otherwise they are not worth anything i guess you get what you pay for
