beware this game does not work with windows xp the vendor said that it would work on any xp version except mediacenter but i have xp pro and it crashes there despite changing compatibility settings to older versions and changing the video resolution i suspect that its like another game we purchased that worked fine when xp first came out but windows auto update changed something that destroyed compatibility with old win  games like thiswe have it up and running on an  year old laptop with win   but its too cpu intensive to run properly on that old thingthe game seems ok for the right pc and operating system though
