this is the first book ive read by meg wolitzer and overall i enjoyed it the plot brings three justturnedthirty friends into close and prolonged contact with the something mother of their recently deceased friend wolitzer is able to pull this off because she obviously likes all of her characters their various flaws notwithstanding she also has the type of sense of humor that allows her to ligthen things up when emotions and events threaten to drag things down too much the strongest character is the mother natalie who is one of the more appealing baby boomers in recent fiction and by no means a mere caricature my only objection is that several secondary characters are not as clearly drawn as the main ones but in fairness to wolitzer in most novels the reader would not even care about knowing more about such relatively minor characters and its only her gift for making you care that makes this an issue at all
