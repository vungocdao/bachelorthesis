no im not making this up somebody actually produced this recording actually two people produced it nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it i say nearly because most of the tracks were played by a trio who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet im not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining these folks certainly were not up to the task the end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties unbelievable
