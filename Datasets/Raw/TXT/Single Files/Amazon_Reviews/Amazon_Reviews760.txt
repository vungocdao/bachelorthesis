westwest yall this album is good for what it is meant to be west coast gangsta music its all about lowridin smokin chronic kickin it and gangbangin in the golden state those who are accustomed to down south music will probably not like some of the west coast funk its a different flavor for some me being from cali i love this stuff it is rare that someone captures the essence of the west i do agree with this not being the best album but its still worth buying its got enough headbangers to get you to the club thats caliya   stars
