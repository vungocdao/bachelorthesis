the actors in the movie are a great bunch but when the plot is very weak you dont get very much i mean liam neeson hes a great actor but was very weak in this movie it wasnt scary at all the the end of the movie was bad there was maybe one scary part which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump that was all i dont recommend this movie to people who like scary movies bc it was a polar opposite
