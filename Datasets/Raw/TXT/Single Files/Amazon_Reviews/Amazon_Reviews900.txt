i bought a simpletech compactfalsh card of mb to use with my digital camera minolta dimage i but it does not work  the card works fine on my pc but there is a compatibility problem with the digital cam i guess simpletech must be aware of the problem since their tech support emailed me that they would post a patch on their website as soon as they would find one but of course i had no clue of the compatibility issue before buying the card so i hope this might help some potential buyers
