when my mac powerbook gs cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after i had gotten my laptop i wasnt sure what to do since the macbook has replaced the powerbook apple no longer sells the adapter and to get the adapter online was really expensive when i found this option i was thrilled it has worked perfectly since the day i got it it is sturdier than the apple adapter and so i feel it will last longer also it is white like many of the apple adapters so if youre worried about the aesthetics of your computer this option is a good one i highly recommend this productmacally psac ac power adapter for apple g
