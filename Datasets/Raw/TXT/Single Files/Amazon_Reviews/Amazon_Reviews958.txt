when i selected this book i was looking for a book i could share with young children ages  years and up to give them a glimpse of nigeria its people and culture i liked the photographs which accurately depicted various professionslifestyles in nigeria and some of them provide wonderful ideas for story book extensions for example the photograph of the grandmother making a traditional outfit could be complemented by presenting to the children a few yards of woven fabric that is typically used in nigeria for such outfits other professional roles we see nigerians in are baker doctor wood carvercarpenter lawyer potter blacksmith and finally the traditional native doctor or herbalist who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties all in all it paints nigerians as an industrious people which is what we are
