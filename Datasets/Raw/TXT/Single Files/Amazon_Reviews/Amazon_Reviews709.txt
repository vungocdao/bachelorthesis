thank god he stopped rapping but now this album sucks too glad it was free hes reppin cali too oh hell no the crazy thing is he tried working with some new and other producers like r kelly and timberland and they did him wrong there are only three tight songs numbers   and  all were produced by rodney jerkins he cant be his sister though this album proves ray j just aint got it maybe he could if he had just stuck with using rodney jerkins but the beats are not supposed to make you tight your supposed to make that beat what it is and more
