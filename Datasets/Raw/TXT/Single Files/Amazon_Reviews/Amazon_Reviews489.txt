i received this as a christmas gift from a friend who knows i like hot tea all of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea i avoid drinking caffein which green tea contains so i gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections the chest is kind of cheap paper glued over something as described by another reviewer its pretty but i dont expect it to hold up
