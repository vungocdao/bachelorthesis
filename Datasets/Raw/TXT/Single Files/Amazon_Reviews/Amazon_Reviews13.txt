i have been using this product for a couple years now i started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers this actualy came in the relaxer kit i tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use i could not find it in any of the stores at the time so i searched amazon and they had it i absolutely love it it is the best moisturizing product i have used so far my hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was i am very happy with it
