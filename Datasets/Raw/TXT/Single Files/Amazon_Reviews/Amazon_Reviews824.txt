considering the price of this card its hard to be disappointed i installed it into my freshly built system using a full version of windows xp as i write this i am watching an old episode of star trek tng on a small screen on top of aol the capture feature works great and the the additional goodiesfrom cables to a nice remote controller are exceptional i never use the enclosed driver disk with new hardware and the dv was no exception there is not any reason not to download the newest drivers for the initial install i have found it reduces many hassles speaking of hassles i have had none with this card windows xp is such an improvement for handling complex components like the dv i would recommend it over hassling over a maxed out win  system this card costs about the same as a prime d gaming card it provides dramatic capabilities ati has really done a great job with this card for the priceit cannot be beat
