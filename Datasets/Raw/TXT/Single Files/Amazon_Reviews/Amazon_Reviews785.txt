being forced to read it in school for its so calledrelation to censorship sp i would have to say burn it althoughthe book is about censorship and whyhow it is wrong i cant say much good about it the theme itself is good but the story itself is trash one of the most unrealistic ideas ive ever heard first off everyone in the country is an idiot second that includes the hero third even those who have minds of their own have no intellegence and finally way to many cracks in the foundation of the story and two many holes in the story itselflr
