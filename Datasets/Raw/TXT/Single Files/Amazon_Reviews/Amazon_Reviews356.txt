i recently purchased the emarker by sony it shows how far technology has come it also shows how useless some of afformentioned technology can be it looks great attached to my keyring needless to say with its sleek stylish good looks it attracts lots of attention the main problem is its lack of extremely useful features i hope sony makes some revisions and releases a better more useful product like we have come to expect from them
