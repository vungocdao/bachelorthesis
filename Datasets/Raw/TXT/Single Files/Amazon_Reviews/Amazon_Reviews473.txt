i bought this to replace my queen size intex bed that exploded inside only lasted months i like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size i think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside the twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger if youre looking for a bed for just yourself this should be perfect
