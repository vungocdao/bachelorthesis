when i first heard this album i loved it after listening to it more closely i still like it a lot but am not quite so blown away by it when it first came out it might have been groundbreaking but so much has happened since in the world of technicalavantgarde metal that much of this album now sounds a little tame the material hasnt aged very well there are a couple of truly great songs in the middle all of the others are definitely good just not mindblowing as some of the material on their older albums still is the new vocalist on this album added a new dimension to the band a great improvement over snake in my opinion if you want a truly great album though get their next phobos
