from a female hardcore lovers point of view i have just got to say that hatebreed is amazing by far one of the best hardcore albums ive heard in a while this album is full of raw true emotion  it makes me aware of where i am with myself as well as with others hatebreed goes further than just delivering a simple hardcore sound  they truly give it in a way that makes me feel the music it has the ability to take one to the emotional edge and back i would love to thank the band personally for creating and sharing thier sound with othersand for inspiring me
