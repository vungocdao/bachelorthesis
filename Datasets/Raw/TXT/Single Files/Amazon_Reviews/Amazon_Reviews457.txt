we bought these beds in september for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit they are  and  and weigh under  pounds these beds can not make it through one single night inflated we either have to get up during the night and reinflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortableweve had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselvesim very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since its clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years agomy opinion is save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on thats what were doing now
