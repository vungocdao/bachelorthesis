this cd has instrumental experimental jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces some of the rhythm patterns have a latin flavor and feel very danceable others remind me of chill out lounge music a few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground i enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background i have not heard the other volumes in the series and so i cannot compare them with each other my only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent some are more mellow and some are more lively but the mood of the cd is more consistent than a lot of collections i have heard some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies two of them felt slightly dissident to me but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing
