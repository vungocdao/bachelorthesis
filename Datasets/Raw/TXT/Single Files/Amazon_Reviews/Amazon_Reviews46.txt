we purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship the bag was convenient to carry however the faux leather began peeling at first it wasnt so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes i would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that i had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes
