i was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use well this is pretty convenient just swipe but it did nothing for me i wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts however my skin remained the same and while it doesnt really have a scent there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because i have quite a sensitive nose i switched to using them on my back and got the same result which was nothing so it was an expensive experiment that didnt work it may work for someone else but it did nothing for me most disappointing i have since switched to the salicylic gel peel which hurts a whole lot more but gets the job done
