i like a lot of people writing reviews play a lot of first person shooters if you liked splinter cell buy traod used i agree with everyone herestory is good controls are less than mediocre even enter the matrix blew this game away customizing the keyboard helps some but less than what i expected i tried to leave feedback for eidos but to no avail hopefully if there is another one it will be in beta for a lot longer and for those of you out there who think that it might be my pc i can assure you that is not the case
