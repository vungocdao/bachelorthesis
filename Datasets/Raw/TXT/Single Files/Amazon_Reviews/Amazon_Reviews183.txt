easy reading book which i would recommend for those who want a sort of executive summary of the story behind wright and his works having said this i found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time not for collectors unless you like myself want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view
