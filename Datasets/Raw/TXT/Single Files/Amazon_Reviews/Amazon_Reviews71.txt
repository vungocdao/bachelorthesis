i ordered this product to slim down my stomach i was looking for something i could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses i wore the squeem to work occasionally and then i would take it off when i got home when i would take it off i felt sore around my sides and my back i washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didnt one night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so i ended up keeping the squeem on for about hours instead of my normal  hours that night when i took the squeem off i had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks im blackon my body i read other review before i purchased the squeem and i didnt see anything that alerted me not to buy it not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you dont say i didnt warn you
