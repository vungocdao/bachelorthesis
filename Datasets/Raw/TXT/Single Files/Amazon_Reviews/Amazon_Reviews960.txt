this is my first lou reed video i can honestly say that i enjoyed it i have gained some new perspective on lous music he is a true professional before i turned it on i knew i would like my favorites sweet jane and walk on the wild side but i found myself enveloped in the other songs which i had never heard before i was a casual lou reed fani think if i liked it then a real hardcore fan will love itthe video is high quality and the sound is great its like having a front row seat im glad i purchased this one
