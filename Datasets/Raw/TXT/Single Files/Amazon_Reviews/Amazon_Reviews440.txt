madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical she is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of lament it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality while in the song beuonos aires she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention she is a great actor if i could change one thing it would be to switch jimmy nail and jonathin pryce because nail should sing more songs and price should sing less
