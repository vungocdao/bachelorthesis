this is a wonderful victorianstyle novel about a manor house its mistress and her domestics wonderful that is until the middle of the story the author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story its spooky and interesting but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrators point of view time and setting make the rest of a great read a downer
