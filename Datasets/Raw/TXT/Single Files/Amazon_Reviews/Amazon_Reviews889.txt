i was originally looking forward to seeing this movie but after i did i wish i hadnt spent the money the story is lame the actors dull and the story is so changed from shirley jacksons wonderful book and the  movie that it doesnt even deserve to share the same title forget about buying this botched movie and purchase the older haunting youll wonder why they bothered to make a remake proving that newer doesnt necessarily mean better
