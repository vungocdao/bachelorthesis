i was so looking forward to this game being released i was on the internet on a weekly basis looking for a new release date delay after delay i bought the game the day of its release loaded it onto my computer and was ready to play i had one disappointment after another first the controls were different from her other games ok i will get use to the new ones second and the biggest controlling her is virtually impossible she is jerky sporadic and down right slow and awkward i have had to reload the game about  times to get her to do a simple maneuver i have given up many times in shear frustration frustration i havent felt in her other games i do not think i will continue playing this game it is time to move on and enjoy myself with another game which is what games are all about sorry core and eidos this could be your biggest mistake especially now that the movies are doing so well what a boost this could have been for you
