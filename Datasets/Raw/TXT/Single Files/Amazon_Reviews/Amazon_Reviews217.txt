donal cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction i find his book to be biased towards the murphydolan faction poorly researched claiming that billy the kid was known as michael mccarty and his findings to be very questionable presents evidence without veryfiable sourcesafter reading this book i asked myself why did cline write this book he seems to not think to much of billy the kid so why write a book about him why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about james dolan and lg murphy
