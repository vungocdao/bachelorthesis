it was a decent book but not a lot of new information for me for the most part it simply confirmed some basics i have long believed in  not living out your dreams through your children encouraging exploration without forcing achievement the need to provide for additional means of learning etc a lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids which really doesnt apply in small towns like we live in some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods a lot of real life examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approachprobably the most novel idea that came across was that its better to be a good enough parent than a perfect one by kleins opinion if you manage to be the perfect parent you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example not sure im  with that but it is an interesting take on parenting
