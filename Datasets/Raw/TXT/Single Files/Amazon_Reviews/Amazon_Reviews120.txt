this is one of the sweetest sad funny and actually profound christmas specials ever well maybe not dostoyevsky deepness but there is quite a lot of depth here unlike a lot of modern christmas specials which are just plugs for toys the suits at cbs hated this series they thought it was too intelligent for kids and they didnt like vince guardaldis jazz score which is a bonafide classic now it almost didnt air luckily it did and we are all better people for it
