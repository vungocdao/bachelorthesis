updateso the workaround described below work for about  daysjust outside the return window the tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through ive tried  sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsetsall have the same issue plug the same headsets into the source pc all channels play out of both earwould not recommend purchasing this itemout of the box if i plug my ear buds from my iphone into the extension fully connected in the female end i only get sound out of the right ear bud verified the same condition with a pair of jvc ear buds as well i have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first click not fully inserted sound comes from both ear buds there is tension with it connected in this fashion so it works but could be better others may have better luck with other headphones
