we had two beloved cats die during my childs fifth year and i wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently this book doesnt promise eternal life or give any religious message in several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life my girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime which i found slightly surprising
