this is a tearjerker mixed with humor a lot of rough patches for this couple but dont let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times too i watch this movie often as i am a hopeless romantic and i thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing hindi style  pop rock mix plus its worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts it ends the way a typical relationship of this type would but thats not exactly a bad thing in this case i recommend it to everyone
