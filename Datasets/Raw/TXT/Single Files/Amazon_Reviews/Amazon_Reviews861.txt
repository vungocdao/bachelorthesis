actually this isnt really even a movie its a really long music video maybe its an advertisement i dont know all i can say is that a good movie requires a few things first and foremost an engaging story and some interesting characters this film lacks both the director is a trickster of sorts who depends on neat stylized filming techniques and devices that attempt to cover up the fact that nothings really happening plotwise sorry but the alternatescenario theme just didnt work at the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds maybe i missed the point is there a point somebody please enlighten me
