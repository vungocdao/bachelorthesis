this is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around i own a  powerbook g which this is listed as being compatible withthe problem is that this isnt actually a watt power cord so dont expect to use your computer while its charging and dont expect to be able to touch the brick as its plugged in youll burn yourselfive returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a ton better
