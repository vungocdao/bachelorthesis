fahrenheit  was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover this book is very difficult to read the correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand the setting is also very hard to have a visual picture although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand i think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book but if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this i also think you need to be above the th grade or a very advanced reader
