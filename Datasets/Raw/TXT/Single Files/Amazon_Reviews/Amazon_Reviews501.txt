romeo and juliet is a beautiful story and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of shakespeare who doesnt like to read or hear about starcrossed lovers who hasnt already heard the legend the play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly and its beautifully written romeo and juliet are so tragic in their love and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless read it for the story but enjoy it for the beautiful prose
