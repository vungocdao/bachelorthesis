this game is boring you cant follow the story line and if i hadnt read the books i would not understand it at all the fight scenes take too long and they are also boring in the mines of moria there is this one place where you have to go but you get stuck because the game has a bug the controls are extremely weird and take a long time to get used to i have bought this game and i do not like it i would suggest not buying it
