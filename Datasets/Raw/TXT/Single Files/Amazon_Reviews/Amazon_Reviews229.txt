i have read this book in search of a way to view my body and my self more positively however this book claims that only the overweight or people with eating disorders lack selfconfidence it is not true obviously i am not overweight and never had any eating disorders but i just dont have a positive selfimage so if youre like me dont read this book i couldnt relate to it the title is misleading
