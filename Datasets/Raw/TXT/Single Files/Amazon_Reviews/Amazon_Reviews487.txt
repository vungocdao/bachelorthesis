this is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality  i got the clear one cause like other reviews say your eye really doesnt jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubblegum my first vibrator hahahaits really quiet for something that movesdoes so much and it is more powerful than i expected i had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration  but even that got the job down in  seconds yeah i timed it this might take some getting used to for some but i absolutely love itthe only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more lifted off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one people have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have a smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale  and it went away after  or  washesi highly recommend buying this
