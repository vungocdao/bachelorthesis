what a wonderful easy book to read and so helpful so many books and articles on this subject are just too plain technical and boring to read not the glutenfree bible it is clear easytounderstand and very engaging i really appreciate how the author relates the issues of living glutenfree to everyday life it is an intelligent book that is fun to read and very very informative at the same time i have never written a book review before but i am so impressed with the glutenfree bible that i want to share these thoughts with everyone and i intend to rush out to buy the other books by this insightful witty writer enjoy to your health
