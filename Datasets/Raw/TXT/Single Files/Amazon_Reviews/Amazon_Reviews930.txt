im always up for another look at the titanic especially if new light is shed on the story unfortunately pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of ballards expeditions on top of that its not interesting the retelling of the events on the ship are fine but they cant carry the deadweight of pelligrinos attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story its the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting pass
