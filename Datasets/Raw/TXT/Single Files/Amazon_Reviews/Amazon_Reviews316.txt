i agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although i am a little biased kerouac is my favorite author this book inspired me to write a poem after i finished reading it and although it may not inspire you to do anything at all it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if youre an artist i read on the road the town and the city and just before this one the subterraneans which i found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were  or  pages long  this one was much more fun to read and i could not put it down if you really like jack you should also check out james baldwin and norman mailer
