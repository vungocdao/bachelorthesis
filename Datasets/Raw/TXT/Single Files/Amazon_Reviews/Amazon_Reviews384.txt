besides the much maligned megahit tubthumping which i didnt like when it was first released but like now this is a solid cd with great arrangements lyrics and performances its not perfect but how many cds are perfect these days i have recently discovered ready mades and then some  clearly a star effort and a symposium on how to arrange a song masterfully done i wont write a songbysong critique here because several other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that however i do put forward a challenge to rtbarry in az to move beyond his very own drivel masquerading as a review if he is capable to explain in detail what in his opinion is lacking in this cd that rates it only one star or does he believe we are supposed to obey his fiat review as if he were kim jongil of north korea otherwise rtbarry dont waste our time with drivel
