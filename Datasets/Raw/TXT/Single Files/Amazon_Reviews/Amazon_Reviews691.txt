if you are security minded and choose to use an email client like thunderbird or the bundled opera email client this program will not protect you not only that but the fact that ca antivirus will only work with ms outlook or outlook express is not revealed in any documentation i found this out the hard way when a manual scan found a virus in my opera mail folder and couldnt clean or quarantine it the ca tech confirmed that the av program only works with ms email clients to me this is false advertising
