i was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery sure back then there was no google searching nor number crunching laptops but plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent probably the books greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences even with todays analytical resources economists are still all over the map on their predictions  conclusions on the other hand meteorologists seem to do quite wellnaturally the radical libertarians teabaggers  republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence i would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty  irrational
