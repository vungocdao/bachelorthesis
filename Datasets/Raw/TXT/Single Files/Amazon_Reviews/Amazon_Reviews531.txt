this is an excellent book and of the clavell books i have read all except gaijin this has the most interesting if not the best ending it seemed to me that clavell got slightly redundant with the natural disaster ending but he managed to avoid it in this book i found that the way the story and the characters individual stories were resolved or rather unresolved fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a wwii prison camp oh yeah the rest of the book is pretty cool too
