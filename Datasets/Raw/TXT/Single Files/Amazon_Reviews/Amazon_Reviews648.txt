this book is a watershed in human intellectual history in it freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes our inner unconscious lives dreams are not nothing and they are not in freuds eyes rare religious gifts but rather to the key to our own mental life freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations i am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing i do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretationsunderstanding human intellectual history is now impossible without knowing this work
