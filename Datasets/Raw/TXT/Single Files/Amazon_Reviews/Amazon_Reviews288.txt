i find that the moves that wally jay was at best very mediocre i am originally from hawaii and have had many judokas that can do major moves that when watching them the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous to see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired though i started martial arts at  years old and became a head instructor at  i have more skills that i need to perfect i just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised
