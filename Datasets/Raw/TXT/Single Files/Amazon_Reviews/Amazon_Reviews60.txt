great racquet but im a power hitter i have no power generating difficulty with this racquet my style is to try to volleyball and everything ive found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered i like the factory grip although with distinct ridges others prefer a smooth grip may  give the factory grip on chance and you may come to like it the sale prices are right for a high about end racquet racquets and black knight in have a reputation for overall durability so you should get plenty of use before replacement note i got my first cc as a d level player and did not like it immediately howeve as my game improved version i switched from my bandit black knight cc white racquet to the great success and have had so it might not be the right racquet for a beginner intermediate to advanced players but will benefit from this fine racquet
