i was going for a medfree birthnot for any reason other than i wanted to because my mom did it with my sisters and i and i figured i could do it as well its what our bodies are meant to do right well this dvd was great it saved me from paying over  for a lamaze class and i felt the stuff she touched on for the lamaze section was perfect i did not have a doula or a midwifejust my husband an awesome nurse and this dvd i enjoyed being able to watch it in the comfort of my own home and go back to certain parts to rewatch its a bit outdated and cheesy but overall very honest and good worked for me if anything its worht the few  for reference after a birthing class im giving  stars instead of  bc they should really look into updating it soon
