i was looking for a wellstructured sideby side version of the canterbury tales bantam classics normally does a great jobs on books but whoever transcribed it to kindle did not know kindle at all left it unstructured and the translation all over the place intermingled with the lines translating the wrong verses and generally just all over the placepractically i am reading four lines middleenglish five lines modern three lines middleenglish  lines modern  lines middleenglish and so forth there is no connection between the middleenglish and its translationthat was a wasted  usd for kindle version and a huge disappointment
