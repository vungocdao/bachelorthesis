reviewer renee s nyc august  the plot is typical noir the hero typical worldweary and disillusioned hammett orchandler but the atmosphere is stunningit was a whole new world for me and i fellcompletely into it from vinnies first nightmare to the final dripping conclusionmr moores descriptions of thailand andthe thai people are evocative and real onecan feel the heat and humidity see the swirlsand flashes of colors and almost touch the waves of misery that radiate offthe pages and the storys not bad either i was interested in all the little tidbitsabout life in bangkok  and the storys not bad either there were a confusing numberof characters some of whom did not advance the plot at all and the plotting could have been tighter but allinall i would definitely recommend the book just be sure you read it in an airconditioned space because otherwise you will surely melt from its heat
