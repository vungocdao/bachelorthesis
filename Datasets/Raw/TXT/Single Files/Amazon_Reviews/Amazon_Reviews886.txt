the haunting with julie harris was so goodeven better for its black and white medium which enhances the sense of the macabre and general offkilterness of the set why dont they remake the wizard of oz now theres a picture that could be made much pertier with modern cinematography the cheap set and old theatrestyle acting throw a damper on whats still is a great universal story
