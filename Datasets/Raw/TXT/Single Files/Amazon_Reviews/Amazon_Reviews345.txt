so for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching this is a hollywood movie made for an audience who loves explosions cars guns sexy women and a simple story line this movie was not made to be realistic it is a sci fi movie just pop some corn watch it and enjoy way better than the notebook or any other chick flick out there
