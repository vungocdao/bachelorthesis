i bought this charger near the end of may of this year and it stopped working about  weeks ago it is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord it looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on amazon it charges quite slowly ibook g  i have a brand new apple brand battery so i dont think it has anything to do with that or the computer from now on i will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead
