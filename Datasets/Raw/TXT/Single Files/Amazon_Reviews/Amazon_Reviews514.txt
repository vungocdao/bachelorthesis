do you really think that this stuff is going to work especially the trapping so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt workthe lin lop sauthe bong lop sauthe same hand tan to lop saucmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be itbut like bruce said man or for that matter any person man or woman is more important than any art or system even applies to jkd and wing chunnot the other way around
