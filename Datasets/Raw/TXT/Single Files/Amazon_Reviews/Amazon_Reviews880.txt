no no no what went wrong bigbudget film with great actors and what do we get a visually appealing film with a completely flat liam neeson and a paperthin storyline catherine zeta jones tries to charm her way through but even though she does an okay job the movie is still bad lili taylor and owen wilson also try to add flavour to it all but cannot manage to save the day all we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content it all seems to be over before it really begins and nothing really makes much sense and the eerie mood is almost totally absent not a good omen for a horror movie is iti just cant believe what went wrong for neeson usually he drags a movie up not down watch house on haunted hill instead if youre into stuffsomepeopleintoahauntedhouseandseeifthesurvive movies then youll se how a proper haunting should be
