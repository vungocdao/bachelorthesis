this book was excellent the author gives us an intimate portrait of one of the greatest and most colorful athletes of the th century babe ruth overall we learn a lot about him and baseball during the roarong s into the smy only issue was that i didnt like the way the book abruptly ended with his death i would have liked to have read more about his funeral and the aftermath of his death plus i would have liked to learn more about how his legacy was treated the years after his deathnevertheless this book is a great read and i highly recommend it to any baseball or sports fan
