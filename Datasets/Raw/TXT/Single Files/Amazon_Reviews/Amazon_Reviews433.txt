i also really loved the book it showed two strong willed people who are at first glance totally wrong for each other i mean a centuries old vampire and a vampire slayer it was ironic i also liked that even though quin was a cold fish on the outside inside he was just as lonely as rashel even if he rarely admitted it i loved the book and couldnt put it down if u havent read it yet do so
