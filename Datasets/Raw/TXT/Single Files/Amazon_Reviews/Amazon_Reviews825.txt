as the other reviews noted there are problems with installing this card even though i got it working successfully in the end although it isnt my top pick for a graphics card i have enjoyed being able to hook it up to my vcr and print my digital videos to vhs yes this is possible although it is a bit tricky to setupi withhold one star on this card for having lack of customer support and being hard to setup if the user manual would have been more comprehensive and if the ati website would have had more help on the subject of installing this card the whole nasty ordeal of card setup that almost all night might have been spared
