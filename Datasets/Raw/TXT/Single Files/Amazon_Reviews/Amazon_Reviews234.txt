baking with julia is an amazing bookit is an exceptionally well written resource that is an accurate reflection of the pbs televised series of same namewhen i stumbled onto the option to order a dvd suposedly of the full series on the books writter dorie greenspan i ordered it immediatelywell the dvd arrived today and it is only a minute fraction ie only  shows from this far more extensive series selection of the books recipes what a misleading dissapointment  as i expected when i place the order for this dvd that it reflected the full series  nothing in the product description indicated otherewisewould i still purchase it if i knew up front that it was not the full series  probably yes  because i love julia as well as the series and the bookhowever the nature of this post is buyer beware
