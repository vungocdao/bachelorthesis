this is a good comeback from the this aint a game album that album was good wit songs like wait a minute where do we go from here wet me and formal inviteetc however this album is even better you can tell that he has grown up on this album i think he is making a name for himself in the music business and wont just be known as brandys kid brother my fav tracks on this album are exotic  love this song  bits cant get enough of it in tha mood anytime one wish what i need and the crunk track keep sweatin however there are a few dodgy tracks on there like quit actin  i was excited when i saw r kelly was on there bt was sadly disappointed when i heard it the war is over  i liked the last duet they did another day in paradise bt after hearing this song they should have stopped then however overall its a good album  well done ray j
