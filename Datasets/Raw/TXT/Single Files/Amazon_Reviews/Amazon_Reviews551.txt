i bought a sansa e for myself and have not encountered any troubles so i decided to buy a view for my boyfriend right out of the box the player would not turn on because the power button was stuck we tried everything but nothing would happen the customer service people could not turn it on also so we exchanged that one the next one we received at least turned on we went home to charge it and then tried to start loading media on thats where trouble came for video and pictures you have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter i was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player we tried different files different computers and different people and nothing my boyfriend spoke to the customer representatives and had no luck i have transferred music video and photos to my sansa e with no problems but this player has many problems
