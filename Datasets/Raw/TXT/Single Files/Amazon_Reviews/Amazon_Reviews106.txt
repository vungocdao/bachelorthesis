 crazy nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids but the scatological humor offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my year old the plot on the other hand while fine for year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience as a result while its probably not the worst film of the year it is certainly in the running
