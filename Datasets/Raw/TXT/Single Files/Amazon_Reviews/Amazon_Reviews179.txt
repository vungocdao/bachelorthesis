this is the biggest waste of money i have spent in a long time it didnt even make it through one bag of leaves i would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back cant believe amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department take my advice and save your moneyi would have given it no stars but didnt have that option in my opinion it rates  stars
