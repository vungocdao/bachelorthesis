the moment i put this cd on and heard the light lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sunkissed gregorian chants followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat i knew this was going to be one journey id be willing to take for many years to comeand that was the impression i got from the first track alone imagine what ensued it only gets better from thereevery song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood and while i find this exotically soothing debut album by black ether an astonishingly overlooked group extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles id have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnicworld flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea
