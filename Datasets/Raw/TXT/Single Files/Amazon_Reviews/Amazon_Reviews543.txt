ok as yall might know me im gamer to the game this game is sorta like the first nba street game for the ps it has some flaws such as lighting also at points of the game you might say is this game worth  well its worth about   its not a good game for portability  lighting is bad at times can be hard for beginners so i suggest that you must know what the first few nba street games are about before buying thsi title psits a fun game after a while
