the main reason why i waited up until  in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice tgreat action and i was dissapionted when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes  mabye she isso it was very entaining worth a watch
