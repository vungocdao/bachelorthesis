i specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose it was to be taken on a trip to visit with my  year old grandson what fun we laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns well after less than a day the only tooth that would cause the jaws to snap was the center tooth not too much fun there i feel i wasted my money
