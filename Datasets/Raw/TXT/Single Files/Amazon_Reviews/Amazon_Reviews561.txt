i play canasta and frequently wind up with gobs of cards which since i have small hands and am also a klutz i drop a lot and mix up the card holders are on the large size so they hold a lot of cards and have little props so they can stand alone they are also slightly curved to prevent other players from accidentally seeing your cards a very good deal for klutzes everywhere
