if you cant hold the cards this will work but i believe they lost sight of their purpose and are trying to address a problem from outside the box the idea is to make it easier for the individual it can be difficult to get the cards in place and then change their positions defeating the fundamental purpose a block of wood will do better the card holder shouldnt be a game within a game
