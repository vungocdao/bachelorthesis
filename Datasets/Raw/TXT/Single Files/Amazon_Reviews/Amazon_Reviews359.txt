emarker started to lose its appeal when i had a problem with the driver sony provided little assistance with the situation and i basically had to solve it through trial and error the website was easy to manuever through but receiving the proper listings wasnt constant i will give sony credit for coming up with the idea and respect its potential however for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain
