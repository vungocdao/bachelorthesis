i really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art instead i found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever she repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book she reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that i stopped caring about her situation her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they dont really lead to anything of interest later on her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves the title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother aside from her death during childbirth i am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book sadly
