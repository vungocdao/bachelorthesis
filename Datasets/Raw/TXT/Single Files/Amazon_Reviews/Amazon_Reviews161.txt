i was so happy with dollys hungry again and her return to real country i like new country  but now it is just like pop music quite a few onehit wonders but dolly parton like tori amos and ani difranco two that came to mind makes an entire album of great music instead of an album that showcases two hit songs if you like folkindie music i think you will love this bluegrass album her cover of johnny cashs i still miss someone gave me chills my favorite song is definitely will he be waiting for me this is bluegrass but i definitely like a female singing it it just mellows it out dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour i couldnt be happier im  have been listening to her since i was little and have never gotten to see her perform live but this album the critics arent just praising a country hall of famer  the album deserves every wonderful word
