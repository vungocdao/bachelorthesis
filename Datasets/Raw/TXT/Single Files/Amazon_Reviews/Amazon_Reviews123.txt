when mr schulz and bill melendez decided to launch this halfhour special for tv there were many things against the odds the music subject treatment and linuss bible reading were unlike anything else tried on tv before work was done in just  months flat considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature and a lot of money and resources were put at stake lucky for them  and a lot of us  sparky hit the nail on the head this film was the absolute winner of next years emmy awards for television for kids programming along with more accolades and recognitions i think the different treatment of the christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and in true peanuts style is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious one of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season
