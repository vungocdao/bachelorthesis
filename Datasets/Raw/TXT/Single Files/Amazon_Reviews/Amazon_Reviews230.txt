the biggest problem with this dvd is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on jamess brake line the episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the dvd it would have taken like  more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order other than that it is a good dvd with  thomas and friends stories in which james is prominent i have a personal complaint too i purchased this in a store not online even though the box said it includes a bonus wooden train my box actually had a take along bertie in it my son didnt have a bertie so i was eager to get it but i didnt realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series my son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better
