i should say worse than battlefield earth proportions this whole movie makes you just sit there at the end and go why everything about this convoluted sarcastic beefed up badly edited tripe is confusing to watch poorly executed and loses you  minutes into the film you are introduced to boring characters cliched camera angles and material we all know john mcteirnan is far more capable of i was thankful i got to rent this instead of buying it because quite frankly this movie just plain stinks if you really want to see the real rollerball rent dont buy the original the original has a much stronger story and for cryin out loudjames caan hes a legend man i dont know what kind of future chris klein has in movies but as far as action movies go lets just put it this way we already have keanu reeves and quite bluntly hes a much better actor steer clear and save your money
