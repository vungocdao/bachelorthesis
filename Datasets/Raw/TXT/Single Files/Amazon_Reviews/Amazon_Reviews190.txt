i ordered two in cowboy slim cut x i already had some wranglers the waist was way too small the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way these were made in mexico just like the ones i bought at target but the badging was different a rubber badge on the back right pocket not the thin leather wrangler badge at the rear right waist were these knockoffs not sure returned them and went to target where i got two pair for  each they were original and legendary gold not cowboy but still half the price pard
