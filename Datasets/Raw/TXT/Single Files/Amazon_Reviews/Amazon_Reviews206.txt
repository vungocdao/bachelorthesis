first thing i noticed about this book was that the pages were stuck together no reallythey were the printer did not get it right when they cut the edges of this book there were many pages that had to be hand cut just to turn them i could not stand the  design then once i get everything readable i find that the information herein is oh about  years old and totally useless for current midi applicationsmight be ok if you are looking for a history of midi and want to spent an hour making the book readable by cutting the uncut pages so that you can actually read them
