when i first heard about this book i wonderded if it was going to be a new story or a continuation fortunately a continuationi had read reviews about the book here and after the local library did not ever have a copy in sock i bought it i read it in  days reading each night after work i can say it was a good read steady flowing action no real dull moments no unnecessary story lines etc i was not disappointed at alli gave it only  stars much for the same reason others have the ending was rushed and abrupt but never fear there is to be  more books before the real ending so we all have something to look forward tothis is only the second koontz book i have read so i was unable to distinguish where he was writing and the other author was writing more die hard koontz fans may be able to tell the differenceso overall a good smooth never dull read highly recommend it to anyone looking for a different take on the classic tale of a mad scientist
