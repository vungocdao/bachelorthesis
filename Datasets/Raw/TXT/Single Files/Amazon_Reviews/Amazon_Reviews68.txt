a friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress i brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but i needed a small it was extremely difficult to put on so i needed assistance once it was on i was still able to contract my core which meant that i needed a smaller size i believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso other then that this is great buy
