if this book is so great then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone to the best of my knowledge only erudites and scholars enjoy this book a good book but one with a limited audience dont read it unless you dont mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences antiquicated words and flowery prose personally i like an author who gets to the point
