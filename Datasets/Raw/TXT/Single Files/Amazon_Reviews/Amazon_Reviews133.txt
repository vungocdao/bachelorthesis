a replacement adapter for my yearold g powerbook was going to cost  from apple the macally adapter is less than half the price and its built like a tank  the wires are thicker and the plastic is more durable the only thing you might miss is having the yellowgreen charging lightbut thats more of a luxury and not a necessity highly recommended
