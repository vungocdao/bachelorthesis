i bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell but i was sadly mistaken when i got halfway through it and i kept hitting glich after glich i thought it was my xbox but i took it to a friends and glich after glich i guess i got the worst game in history but thats what happens when you get a massed produced game like this one
