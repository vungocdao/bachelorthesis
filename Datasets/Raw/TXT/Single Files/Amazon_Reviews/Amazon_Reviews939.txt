i bought this cd initialey by mistake i was in a hurry and missed the cd i wanted right next to it it must have been gods hand directing me to this stunning album i had only heard the band on the radio and by the time song one was over i was hooked i sat there and let shirley mansons rich voice enthrall me through the rest of the cd i went out immeadiately and found their first cd which was just as good but in a different way that is what makes this a great band among other things the ability to reinvent without loosing the soulsound of the musictwo great albums i can only hope that they grace us all with many more
