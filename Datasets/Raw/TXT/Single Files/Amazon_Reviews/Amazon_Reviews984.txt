one of the few recent films that i anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectationssir ian mckellen once again performs well the real surprise here is brendan fraser thanks to bill condons amazing screenplay fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to mckellens anguished and selfdefeated character make a point to get this one best screenplays consist of strong dialogue pacing and narrative the oscars are usually accurrate about that
