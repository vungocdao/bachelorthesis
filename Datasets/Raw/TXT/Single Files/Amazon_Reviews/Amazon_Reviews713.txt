bayard is a startlingly fine writer who has made a number of smart decisions with this novel its not a sequel to a christmas carol as some readers assume its a great thriller that makes just the right use of its source material slyly dropping in details that are a delight if you know your dickens but in no way detract if youre just reading it as a tightly contructed historical thrillerremarkable definitely a writer to watch
