ill admit it was years ago when i had seen part of this movie remake that was so bad so corny so awfully unscary that i couldnt even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through and i a lover of all things spooky i do recall however three things about this movie the directing was awful the script was terrible and cathy jones i didnt know who she was  she hadnt married the old man yet which really launched her career gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie no i speak in haste  there were a number of worst things about this movieif you want to be creepedout read the book the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson if you must see the story in movie form watch the old black and white original from  starring julie harris its dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigohappy hauntingnesswind in hare
