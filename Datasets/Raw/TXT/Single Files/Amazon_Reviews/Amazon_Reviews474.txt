i have been a fan of step rideau and the zydeco outlaws since i purchased their cd standing room only im so glad has quickly become my favorite some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco this is a must buy for zydeco lovers if the grammys had a catagory for zydeco step would win for performer of the year
