ok first of all i was looking for lighthouse the classic poprock group there was nothing to tell me that this album was a gospel cdok i can live with thatso i listen to my new lighthouse gospel cd let me tell you i was not impressed the engineering sucked the music was mmmmmmm ok i guess and the singing really had no feeling or substance behind itso if you are into gospel steer clean and if you are looking for lighthouse the classic poprock group this is not itlatter
