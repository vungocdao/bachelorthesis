i just moved out of my moms house and i didnt want to bring my huge beddressar with me so i got the airbed its been  months since i moved out and im still sleeping on it you can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed i like mine halfway deflated its like sleeping on a cloud
