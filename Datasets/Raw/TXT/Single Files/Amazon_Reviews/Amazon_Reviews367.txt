this video was let down the historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster and a pain to fast forward thru every time i want to practice dancing i agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to freestyle and improvisation i am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly and without any commentary i find myself struggling during this part or worse  just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated on the positive side the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful especially the belly roll and undulations i was really struggling with those and im now confidently on my way i wish they had covered more moves in that manner bottom line its been a week and im already seeking out another video to buy
