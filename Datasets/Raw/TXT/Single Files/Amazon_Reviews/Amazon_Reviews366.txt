i was very disappointed to discover that the copies i ordered the scary trilogywhile described as being illustrated by stephen gammell were actually the updated versions with watereddown artwork by another artist i am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork this is the first time ive been disappointed with an order from amazon but its a big one you need to change your description to include the correct illustrator
