this book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirtysix warships ranging from a roman galley to a nimitzclass aircraft carrier naval buffs will find this a useful book with numbered guides accompanying the cutaway color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships yet the selection of what constitutes a great warship is rather idiosyncratic the selection is exclusively western in its orientation as chinese junks ottoman galleys or imperial japanese navy vessels completely absent moreover the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both leaving out others more deserving in the process as a result while an interesting resource it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book
