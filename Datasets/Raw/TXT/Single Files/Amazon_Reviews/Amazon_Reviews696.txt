here is another example of hollywood going wrong the history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right nevertheless the film makers got a few details correct but then added improbable special effects far too many triplanes annoying social lesson stereotypes and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage conceptually the movie should have been a winner in execution it is a disappointment they ruined a potentially good story instead of buying this movie i would suggest the blue max as the aerial scenes are far better or just propose that the wouldbe viewer read a history bookas a parting comment however i always have liked jean reno he is the good part of this film
