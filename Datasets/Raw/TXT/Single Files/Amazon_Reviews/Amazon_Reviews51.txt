i should have known going into this movie having judd apatow a part of it would mean i would hate it however having adam sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a very hopeful chance the movie loses its true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible  crude jokes i have to say we didnt make it more than  minutes into the movie before turning it off it is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior i just dont believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior very disappointing
