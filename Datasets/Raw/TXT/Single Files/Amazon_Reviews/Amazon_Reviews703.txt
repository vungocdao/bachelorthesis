just another one of those movies a bunch of young kids travelling somewhere and get cut up into pieces because some psycho wants their organs neither scary nor educationaltommy you are taking anatomy  and believe me this movie doesnt help you pass that class many scenes are too dark to tell what happened hear someone scream and some light streakes across the screen and the next thing you know someone has dropped it is okay to see it for free but not worth it when you pay for the ticket
