i just began using this book to review for the gre in april i havent gotten very far into the book but in the first  pages i have already found four seriously misleading errors and thats just the ones ive caught some of the equations even the hendersonhasselbalch they provide are wrong there is even a convenient example worked out with an erroneous equation you can use this book to learn about what topics you should study for the gre but do the actual studying from real chemistry textbooks
