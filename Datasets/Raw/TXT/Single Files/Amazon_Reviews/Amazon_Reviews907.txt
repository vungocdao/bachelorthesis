marquez book takes the reader through the lives and times of what i hope is an atypical columbian  family covering from roughly the s to the s it was fun in parts but oddly repetitive with a style that seemed half magic realism half freud and of course the standard enervating antiamerican diatribes were thrown in i guess a latin american author even in magic realism mode cant overcome his predilictions
