wow words can barely express the awesomeness of this piece first i will start with the movie brilliant that is all there is to be said about the film now the ost beautiful work a very dark and somber piece very moody and atmospheric its not something you just listen to for fun at least for me its more of a background music while doing your business its just brilliant every track in amazing from beginning to end i was unfamiliar with johnny klimek and reinhold heilds work this cd however makes me want to definatly look into it it is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film some tracks are very tranquil and moody while others pound out beats and are very fast paced all in all a  for the cd a definate must have for any collection highly recommneded
