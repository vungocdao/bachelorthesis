this tape is simply fun and informative i am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but i had to watch this im a woman why not the lady is so corky and yet serious enough to have you practically writing notes like your in a college i would recommend this video to anyone interested in really learning about childbirth she explains everything how your body should be functioning what is stretching what liquids to look for as signs of this and that charts of how the baby is actually sitting and how exactly its growing and she even quizzes the husbands there is so much to learn open a bag of kettle corn and grab a pillow though its like four or five hours long phew but it probably wouldnt be best to watch it all in one sitting anyway it is a lot of information to grasp enjoy
