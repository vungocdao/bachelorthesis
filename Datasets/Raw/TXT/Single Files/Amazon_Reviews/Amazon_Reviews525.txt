if id only read the reviews before purchasing this for my  year old i would never have bought it it is very flimsy and top heavy the elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together as i was driving all over town looking for the best price i wondered why no store had the batcave out on display once we got it together i realized why we ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over we have lots of batman toys and other mattel products this is by far the biggest disappointment in  years of toy buying if it wasnt from santa it would be going back without a doubt buy anything else
