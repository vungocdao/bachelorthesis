another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for i was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued is this true or is this a classic baitandswitch technique their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price when you get to the store they dont have it but when they look it up in their computer it shows up as discontinued it is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be aboutadifferent models from the one you actually buy online or instore the creative labs own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion
