this movie left me on the edge of my seat and short of breath once just wasnt enough in the theater i just had to see it again on the big screen i never used to be into movies with subtitles but the effect just isnt the same as it is in its native tongue just when i thought its over it just takes you on another turn and another and another if you like fast paced unpredictable action with a soundtrack that fits its movie like a glove this ones for you
