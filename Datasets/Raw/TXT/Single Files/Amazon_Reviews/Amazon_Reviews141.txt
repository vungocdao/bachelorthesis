out of the difficult to open package this adapter worked for a couple of daysi missed the light on the end of the standard apple adapter yellow for charging green for chargedbut the price was right until it started cycling on and off the mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten boy was i glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between ac and battery unplugged the macally computer ran fine on just battery runs fine on the apple charger i had left at homethe good news is the return to amazon was extremely easy presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesnt void my refundive ordered a different brand with light this one may have just been a bad example ive had good luck with other macally gear
