much to my amazement this book has been placed on banned lists in several states its an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt although the story does allude frequently to adultery there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear
