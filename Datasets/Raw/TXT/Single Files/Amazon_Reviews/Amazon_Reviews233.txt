like this is breath of fresh air in the dance music world filled with meaningless technobeat with no specific direction this song brought back the good memories of the s by using a sample of the classic clean up the ghetto monday midnites freestyle story about his experience at a london underground discotheque is unique and his succintly clear and distinctive accent is rare and i like it a lot plus the song keeps you dancing till the last beat love it
