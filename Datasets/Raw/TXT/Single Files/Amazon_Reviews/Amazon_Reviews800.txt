this book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring the author has a good idea we should read instead of watching tv but if this book is one of the choices you had better turn the tv back on i mean who in his right mind would ever write a book with  wall tvs robot dogs and burning books and the story never really had an ending it just stopped i guess to end the boredom i think the author had to get some sort of deal with all the teachers to assign this book how else would it get on the required reading list maybe he gives  of the profits from sales please dont buy this book you are supporting a lunatic
