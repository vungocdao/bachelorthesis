this was a really fun read the dialogue was witty and clever i really enjoyed the progression of the romance it probably could have been tied up a little sooner the last th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced i do wish more of nick and rachels storyline had been included just because i enjoyed their banter and potential i recommend to any modern romance fan
