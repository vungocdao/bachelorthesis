this movie is one of the worst ive seen in the past year right there with the whole nine yards and cruel intentions the plot is predictable the actors worthless or maybe the plot just wasnt any good and theres really no good reason to watch it see if this movie were at least rated r and they actually showed some ta instead of just hinting at it maybe thered be a reason to watch this movie what with all the hotties in it however bad dialogue combined with predictable plot bad performances by actors and hotties but no nudity makes for a totally worthless movie what a waste of my time
