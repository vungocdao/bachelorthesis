as a child i would stare at the gammells illustrations while rereading each story over and over the illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion the new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice i am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print dont buy this for yourself or your kid i loved these books so much when i was a kid that i am actually going to write a letter on paper with a stamp to harper collins telling them about the role that crazy art had on my imagination and development as a creative person jeez absolutely terrible the new illustrator must have no dignity to ruin this
