sorry about the star rating  it is not for the books content i cant read it but for the horrible way it displays on my ipadthe cover page is nice and big fills the screen and looks great ever subsequent page however is about half size meaning that two pages fit across the ipad screen and the font is too small to be readablefurthermore the ipad version only allows landscape viewing and the stupid kindle app remains in this orientation after returning to my books list and moving on to another bookam i missing something here
