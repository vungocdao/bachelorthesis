i picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it i rated this book  stars because even though i found it to be very enjoyable i seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading nevertheless i was still surprised by the ending i found the tension between hester and monk to be both intriguing and frustrating especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book needless to say i was delighted to discover that there are  soon to be  more books in the series i plan to read them all
