my first foray into the novels of patricia cornwell has left me impressed the characters were intense and realistic my only concern is that the evil temple gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning why did he decide to trail and give gifts to dr scarpetta needless to say i will be reading more of cornwells books especially if they are at all like this novel
