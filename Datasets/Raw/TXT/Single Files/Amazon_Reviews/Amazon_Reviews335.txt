by most accounts the michael baydirected transformers films to date are not very good but that hasnt stopped them from making gobs and gobs of cash and this third installment dark of the moon made the most of them all this time around sam witwicky and the autobots must race to recover and protect an ancient autobot ancestor who crash landed on the moon but the decepticons interfere and things arent exactly as they seem i found dark of the moon to be an improvement over the second installment with some impressive special effects work and action sequences but the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired dont expect to find much more to the movie than ooh big robots and explosions but hey for some thats really all you need
