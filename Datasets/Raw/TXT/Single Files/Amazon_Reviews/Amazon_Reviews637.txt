a rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period houses argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument an argument which goes something like this many impressionist works and also those by manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and techniquethey are thus subversivedisruptive and oppositional and as a result political i had expected the book to address in a more explicit detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics however many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter  the viewer of modern life is well worth a read
