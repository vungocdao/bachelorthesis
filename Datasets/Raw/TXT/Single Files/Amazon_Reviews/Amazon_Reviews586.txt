this movie was very boaring i really didnt enjoy it at all it was to gory i just dont enjoy when people kill i also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age and dont enjoy the anceint times they were rough and crewl times the movie the odyssey took place in greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures i really dont enjoy things like that others might although  there is a part i did like i enjoyed the part of the movie when calypsovenessa williams kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for  years i thought that was very interesting the other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as penelopegreta scacchi atheneisabella rossellini cyclopesreid asato and eurybatesron cook those were just a few so all in all i would give this movie one star i f you like movies like this then its great and go watch it but if you dont its not a movie for you as you can see
