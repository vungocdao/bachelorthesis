this  horror film based on the original the haunting is creepy in some ways but altogether its not really a great film at all it has good acting and the scares and popouts are clever things that boost my rating from a  to a  with an ending that isnt perfect but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart the film moves slow in the beginning and it starts to pick the pace soon after and later has its intense ending the film is ok in some ways but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win but it still isnt horrible i liked the house and the setting though that was cool the complete storyline was pretty good also if you want some innovative horror from  i suggest you get the blair witch project
