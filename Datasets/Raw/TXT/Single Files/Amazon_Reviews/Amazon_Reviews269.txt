this has got to be one of the most depressing books i have ever read not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing which it was but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality this was the first book i attempted to read by the author since i couldnt waste my time trying to finish it i am pretty sure i wont be reading any other books by jamaica kincade
