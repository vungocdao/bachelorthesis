i was looking forward to a new scanner after my hp died after just a year i purchased this one based on the several good reviews on amazon and other sitesnow that i have the scanner i am sorely disappointed the picture quality is horrible no matter the tweaking i do in the scanner dialog the picture is faded and grainythe software itself is the least useful interface ive ever worked with the auto buttons makes the image worse the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to paperport something i never want to do
