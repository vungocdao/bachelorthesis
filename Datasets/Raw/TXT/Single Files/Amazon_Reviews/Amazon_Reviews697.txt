i have enjoyed watching flyboys several times the special effects are outstanding and very lifelike one of the features that i really enjoyed was watching the bonus features at the end i noticed that one of the people interviewed was from colorado and as a result i went to his museum and checked out versions of some of the planes represented in the moviei find the investment in time and money for this feature was well worth it
