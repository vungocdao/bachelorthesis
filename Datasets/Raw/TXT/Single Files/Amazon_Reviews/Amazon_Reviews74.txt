i have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasnt elastic based found this item and have to say i am pretty pleased the hooks do take a while but once they are all done the waist cincher does what it says it will do the only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about it does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms so i cant wear this with a top that is clingy can only wear with looser fitting shirts oh well nothing is perfect
