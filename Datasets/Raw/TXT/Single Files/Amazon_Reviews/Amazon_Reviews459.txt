i saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase we ordered two twins for our camp mine started leaking immediately my husbands seemed to be good from spring to nearly winter when his too began to leak so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat that was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge my father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again our camp closes down during winter so spring will be the big test i suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe theres hope
