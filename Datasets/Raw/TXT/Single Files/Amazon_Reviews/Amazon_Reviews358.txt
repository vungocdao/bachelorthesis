where is the space for a zero star just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing i should have read these reviews first all the bad you hear about this little thing is true i am not priveliged enough to live in an area sony feels compelled to offer service in so i dont even have one station to mark the site is terrible and i cant even get the program to enable itself whats the difference though cant do anything with it anyway this is typical sony my advice check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area believe me they wont tell you it will not work in your area it however is a neat idea needs lots of work
