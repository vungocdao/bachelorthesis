its a very nice camera dont get me wrong however due to its compact design the speaker is too close to the tape motor during quiet and not so quiet areas you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record canon confirmed this as a design flaw the zr  and  all do this i was really disappointed i returned mine i wish there was a way to fix it
