this is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type if you have a basic knowledge of yoga you dont need this at all  you can create and tailor your own workout if you dont know yoga its useless the instruction is poor peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga no wonder the surf mags think its great with little very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga in some scenes you cant even see their feet a crucial failure  even if the instructor says what to do save your money take yoga long enough to learn it properly then apply it to your own surfing yoga is great for surfing but this is a poor video
