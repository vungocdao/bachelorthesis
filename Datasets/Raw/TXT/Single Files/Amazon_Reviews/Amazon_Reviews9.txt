firstlyi enjoyed the format and tone of the book how the author addressed the reader however i did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal if you are just starting to research law school and do not know all the requirements of admission then this book may be a tremendous help if you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions i recommend some more topicspecific books for example books on how to write your personal statment books geared specifically towards lsat preparation powerscore books were the most helpful for me and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation yet for those new to the entire affair this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you
