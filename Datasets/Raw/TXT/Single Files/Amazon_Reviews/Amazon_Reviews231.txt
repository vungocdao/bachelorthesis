the set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oillike substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous also the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened or dulled however you look at it i have difficulties cutting through even thin soft silicone sheets sharpening them with a rotary tool helps but i feel i shouldnt have to do that with a brand new product which i am sure is actually repackaged i cant imagine using them for metal let alone most rubbers despite the very affordable price i would not have purchased this set for the above reasons
