the reason i gave two stars when i usually give  stars for ms feehans books is bc this book was tooooooo mysterygothic genre rather than romance i really didnt feel like the two main characters were in love in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroines point of view and i was getting sick of her whining and her point of view unlike the dark series you really didnt feel any passion the book is better suited for the mysterygothic genre and not romanceeven the mystery was not that good its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages throughout the entire book youre kept in suspense of who was the bad guy if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pagesms feehan if your reading please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery
