though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracys manual i found the novel to be rather enjoyable the idea of how the world would be shaped and for what reasons was interesting and the narrator was able to lead the reader into the world and allow the reader to be engulfed into thingsthe end was well done and it was a good closure to the work the character does not die but he is changed indeed he awakens to thye doctrine of the state and accepts it yeah he has been tortured and brainwashed but he does not give in under that torture though seeds are definitely laidif you have the time and you like depressing books about totalitarian states that try to stamp out individual thought and reason go ahead and pick this book up if you want something lighter though i would try to find something else
