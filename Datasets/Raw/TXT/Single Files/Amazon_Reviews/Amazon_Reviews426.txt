ever since i got this album since last summer i kept on thinking what this album will sound like i never wanted to stop listening to this album because their music is so spectacular if you heard the first track laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer it reminds me of the beatles eerie song revolution  from the white album i couldve just imagined while listening to baby lulu and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds this is the best album ive ever heard and i listen to this album while i study and you should listen to this while youre at work or home stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them byebye
