after being nearly obsessed with into thin air and the climb i eagerly awaited the latest book from lene i also lived in and speak danish  an added bonus however i found lenes chronicle pretty weak with little background or insight in the writing this book was written more like a journal without analysis and should have been billed as such for gaining insight into the state of mind for lene it was interesting for better writing and deeper analysis about the  tragedy stick to the other  books
