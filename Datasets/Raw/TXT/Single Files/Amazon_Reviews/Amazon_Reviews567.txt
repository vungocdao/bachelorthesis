i was extremely excited to pop this dvd into my computer and watch it but please be aware this is more like a documentary and please dont let me deter you from buying this dvda lot of interviews about the the world championship mixed with some great interludes of the interviewee riding watching them ride will inspire all of you mountain biking enthusiast out there as the description states this is about the riders and sacrifices they go through not about their riding skill and extreme stunts i expected nonstop action but this is still a great dvd to add to my collection ive watched it a few times just to watch them ride their riding chaptersa must buy for anyone serious about competitive dh racing shred it up all
