for all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in charlies own words youre mistaken at the time of the so called interviews the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils tape recorders etc the words you see are those of the authors same old media hype to make a buck the author betrayed charlie by pretending to be his friend this is why charlie declines so many interviews everybody distorts everything he has ever said so my advice is if you want to read the authors take on charlie buy it if you want the truth dont buy it
