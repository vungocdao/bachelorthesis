the sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right i am  size   lbs before baby and i gained about  lbs during pregnancy just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies i dont like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like i have back boobs the shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesnt feel smooth all over squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage if you do decide to purchase this product its easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts
