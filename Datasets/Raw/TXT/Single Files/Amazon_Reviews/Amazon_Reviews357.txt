i too bought into the hype that the emarker presented but after using it for a week i realized how pathetic this product is its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and nothing else you have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station it doesnt even do that how stupid does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it tsk tsk the product is also really dependent on the internet so if you dont have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker actually even if you do have a cable or dsl line its still useless
