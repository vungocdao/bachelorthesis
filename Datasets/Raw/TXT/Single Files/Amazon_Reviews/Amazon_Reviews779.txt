this is definitely one of the worst books i have ever come across in the modern version there is a forword and an introduction both of them have nothing to do with the story and ray bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that no one cares about i almost fell asleep during the forword i dont know how i survived the book the book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace as for ray bradbury himself he states in the introduction that in his eyes hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book i think that this statement is pretty much self explanatory for his views on humanity great guy eh
