one might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors although i respect those who disliked the scarlet letter i disagree its no wonder that people that dont know how to capitalize the word i i thought that this book was wonderful if you are willing to put effort into understanding it
