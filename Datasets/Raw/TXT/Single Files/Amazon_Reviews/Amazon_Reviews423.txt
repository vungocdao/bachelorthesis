this is probably mel gibsons first film a film hes done while he was in his s there is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native australia but this film launched him as an international movie star especially since they released mad max  which was universally released as the road warrior and the road warrior is one of my top ten favorite films of the ssure mad max has some of that cheesy seventies style but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made todaymad max is that one film being over  years old that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than  years old today this film is a classic in the action hero dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre
