i bought this for my off campus residence and the two months it worked fineand then the problems began first two the curves on the top not sure what exactly they are called merged into one so i had to sleep on one half of the bed recently i noticed it was starting to sink and reinflated it shortly afterward i heard some air and found where it was leaking and didnt think too much off it then in the middle of sleeping i woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up then i found out that the main support line is for their pools i would recommend a different brand like coleman or getting something from cabelas
