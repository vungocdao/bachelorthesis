this was a very disappointing purchase the premium hand decorated exotic wooden tea chest appears to be pine decorated with printed paper although the print is very nice the description of it is a bit overblownthe tea inside was okay some of the combinations of flavors just didnt go well together and often drowned the flavor of the tea
