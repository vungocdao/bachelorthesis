ive seen mad max dozens of times but after watching the new se dvd it was like watching it again for the very first time that is not an exaggeration the new dvd offers the choice of the poorly dubbed us soundtrack or the original australian soundtrack watch the original track the pacing of the film changes entirely as do the characters the original soundtrack breathes new life into this filmthe features are great theres a trivia track that pops up info about the production cars and aussie slang terms used as you watch it  documentaries tv spots theater trailer and morethe print is fabulous and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen having seen it both ways now i can tell you that the pan  scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action if youve seen this movie in the past and thought it was ok this new dvd will have you saying it was great
