based on what i have researchedread each pill in this formula should contain mg oflovastatins icluding monacolins ka formthe fda will not allow these companies to print this on the label they want everyone reliant on large pharma this formula was tested and contained no mycotoxin citrinin thought to cause chronic kidney disease in the balkans where this toxin is found in high levels a dosage of three pills a day should be a good start and is the minimum effective dosage shown to work in clinical trialsi would also recommend taking a coq supplement like qgel which is solubilized in polysorbate  for excellent absorption
