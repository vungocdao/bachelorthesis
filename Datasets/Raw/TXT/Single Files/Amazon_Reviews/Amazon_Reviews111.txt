first of all i saw the review by tyley mike relite and thought he was grossly overcritical of everything and every instrument played so id like to hear tyley mikes album since he thinks he can do better  seriously i think some people dont understand that things sound the way they were meant to sound if they sound poppy they made it that way why the hell should they stick to the norm they want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds greati cant write a good enough review for this album all their albums actually as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting it bugs me when a group doesnt evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were all the time so i was glad to see them progress and growtheres too much to say to describe this album but frankly i dont think i could write a good enough review to do it justice so ill just give it my  stars
