couldnt agree more w prendergasts review concerning the laughable typos i thought the proof reader or editor of the version i had must be abusing drugs themselves how distracting to read a so called classic and find it reading like a hs sophomore paper  and a drunk sophomore at that i somehow managed to finish the book but came on amazon immediately following it to see if others read the same erroneous version weird typos poor punctuation etc ruined it for me
