this is yet another lush shimmering pscyoerotic opera by franz schreker wonderfully performed by the forces involved  i suggest you just read the review of  to get a good summary of the surreal plot at least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composers masterpiece die gezeichneten and while i wouldnt disagree with that judgement this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling particularly in the second half other than mozart bizets carmen and a small handful of others im not a great opera fan but schrekers output in this genre to be absolutely stunning highly recommended
