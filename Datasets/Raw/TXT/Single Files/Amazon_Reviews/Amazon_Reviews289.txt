my review centers on only one thing  the type size this edition is disappointingly and in my humble opinion unnecessarily small increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and at most increase the book length by about a hundred pages since it is currently at almost  pages i feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another  pages with no problemwhat makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldnt require a magnifying glass if it was just a little largeri really dont believe our lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read his wor
