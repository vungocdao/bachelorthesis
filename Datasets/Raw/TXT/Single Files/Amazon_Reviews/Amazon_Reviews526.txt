our almost  year old couldnt wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection it looks great on the box however this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost  years it is so flimsy and cheaply built pieces fall off and it tips a lot hopefully it will be redesigned with sturdier materials if you are considering purchasing itdontyoull save your self some money and frustration
