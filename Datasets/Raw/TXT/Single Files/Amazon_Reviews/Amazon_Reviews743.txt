at first i did like the book then it just started to suck right around the time when winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend i hated the book so much that i forgot her name the first hundred or so pages i liked then it just got really boring so ii highly reccomend that you do not read this book and please for the love of god dont read that brave new world book by hoxley it is twice as worse as  to put it bluntly dont read any george orwell your just waisting your time
