in this book not only is there no real love scenes but to top it off the girls cousin tries to convince her that he is her soulmate granted angel is dead but hes still related to her and definately should not be trying to catch his own cousin ewww to top off the wrongness that is this book there is barely any mention of vamps and stuff also this is a coming of age story about how being popluar isnt the most important i love every other night world book but this is retarded
