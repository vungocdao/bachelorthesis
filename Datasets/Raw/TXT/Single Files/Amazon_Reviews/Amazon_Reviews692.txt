this was their first true recording project although it was thier second full album i give this album four stars because though i love this album and this band five stars would mean its an album that stands next to physical graffitti the white album and a select few other records this album is a must own for fans who enjoy any of the splinter disciplines of what sabbath hendrix and zeppelin started an album worth the money with many great songs and performances if there are any criticisms one would be the production it leaves some room for improvement beyond that i hope this band can continue to build upon this awesome release for years to come purchas and enjoy
