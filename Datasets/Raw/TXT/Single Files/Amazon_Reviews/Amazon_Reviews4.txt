reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines i am weaning off my vhs collection but dont want to replace them with dvds this unit is well built easy to setup and resolution and special effects no progressive scan for hdtv owners suitable for many people looking for a versatile productcons no universal remote
