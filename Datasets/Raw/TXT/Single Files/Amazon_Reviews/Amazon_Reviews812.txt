i wont go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis after the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing annie starts out as a strong quirky individual by midbook shes so hung up on jake that she looses her charm and strength of character jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy the secondary characters problems just brought the book down further that and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well once again a female character meltspun intended i guess i had anticipated stronger female and male characters the ones i get from  i think ms wells shows promise but the next book ill get from the library
