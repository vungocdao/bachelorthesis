i had never read this author but knew of many who did when i read that this book was being made into a movie it seemed a good opportunity to read her before seeing the screen mess up her work now i pray that the screen does soi was extremely disappointed with this work it is unrealistic fails to capture the reader and at points when i should have been completely engrossed left me struggling with whether i wanted to pick it up i hope she has written better than this or else there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors availableher characters are not sympathetic they do not draw the readers attention and they are dull in overall scope i have too many other good books to read before i pick up another book from this author
