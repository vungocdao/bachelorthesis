i cant imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box  its tones are set in a specific pattern and it doesnt deviate from that at all but colleen somehow makes music boxes magical again by mixing the traditional plucked sounds with their reprocessed and synthesized counterparts she manages to evoke a fairy tale mysticism whats is a componium part  goes from thick sonics to singular tones at the end and even it charless birthday card relies solely on iterations of pop goes the weasel will you gamelan for me is its own creation immediately the tinkling comes fast and furious on whats is a componium part  a track that sparkles like moondust calypso in a box shows off the more processed side and has an almost senor coconut feel for its short running time the standout piece here is the final track ill read you a story which appeared on an earlier album but is always welcome anywhere
