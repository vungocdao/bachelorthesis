this is a fun movie for children my sons watched this too many times when they were  years old and i am convinced this had a significant impact on them learning to love the game of hockey i know that sounds corny but it is true my oldest is now playing hockey in college and my younger son is playing in high school  club good clean movie i bought these two copies for two friends of mine who have younger sons interested in the game hopefully it will impact them like it did ours go ducks
