listening to this cd i turned my car stereo all the way up on my way back from work the lyric is very ostentatious and the beats are showy  dollars and hombre are two of my favorite tracks they are both clever yet funny it does have a political overtone but its ok i like the revolution type mood its actually very good stuff when you are on a plane totally blocks out the crying sound of babies next seat and you can imagine a party in your head
