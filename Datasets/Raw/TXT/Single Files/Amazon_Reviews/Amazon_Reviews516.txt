if you dont like to be surprised in the least bit this novel is for you if you dont mind the writers technique or dont see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book i on the other did not the plot was predictablethe characters were onedimensional and the language reminded me some what of mcmillan  an unpolished mcmillan of course the best part of this book was the cover and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied
