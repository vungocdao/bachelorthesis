as a public school librarian i would say that lifetimes is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child or children in dealing with the subject of death however as a person of faith i would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after deaththe text states nothing that is alive goes on living for ever this statement either reflects the authors intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death or it could be interpreted as their belief statement this is why id suggest that lifetimes be read by or shared with a caring adult who would be able to answer a childs questions based on a familys belief system
