ill make this short and to the point im quite the avid reader but usually i dont enjoy books of this nature opting for fantasy and scifi escapism instead this story is just beautifully told though the subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner i was hooked immediately i honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book and i urge you to give it a shot i know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more adventure action type books but there is no lack of excitement here
