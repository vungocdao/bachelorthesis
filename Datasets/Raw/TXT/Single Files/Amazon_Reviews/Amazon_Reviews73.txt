my wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size she made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small we have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins thats why she wanted the apparel she was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didnt fit
