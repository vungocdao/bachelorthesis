i saw this movie when it first came out it was hauntingly beautiful i am so happy to get it on dvd some may find it a little slow in areas but i loved it if you appreciate the work of david lean and the acting of sarah miles and robert mitchum then you will love this it ranks right up there for me with dr zhivago which i also had the pleasure of seeing when it first came out on the big screen a wonderful epic movie the seller was extremely prompt and made the purchase feel as though i was buying from a friend way to do business
