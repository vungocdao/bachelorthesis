cant believe i have never reviewed this book before first read this back when i was  like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soulmates which drug me into these books rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him
