while i loved both movies jean de florette and the sequel manon of the spring i would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second they are both masterfully done and you really cant watch just one of them as they are an inseparable pair the first movie forming the background for the second and the second providing the resolution for the first without giving up too much of the story these movies tell a story of greed accidental murder and resolution with the likes of greek tragedycritically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime my only criticism of the nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision overall this flaw can be overlooked as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come
