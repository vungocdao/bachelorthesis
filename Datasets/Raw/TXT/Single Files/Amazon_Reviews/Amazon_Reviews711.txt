well i am i have to say in all honesty a true magnum fan in the past i followed them all the way to see them perform live and at there very best which was in my own personal opinionall the time  vigilante is certainly one of magnums finest examples of good solid heavy rock on any one given cd  need a lot of love is one of there finest along with vigilante of coarse  and there is also tracks like lonely night and midnight on there too  i personally have all magnums cds as im so into there genre of music and culture  i simply couldnt be without  but if you like a bit of live in concert magnum then i recomend that you get youre hands on magnums live cd
