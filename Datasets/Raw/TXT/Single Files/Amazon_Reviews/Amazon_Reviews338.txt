i went to see this with the hope of getting revenge of the fallens bad taste out of my mouthfission mailedwhere to begin the plot while being nowhere near as immature as rotf still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense its an overlong mess with the cgi eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film its clear that bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life its not his fort and hasnt been since the rock the movie peaks with a huge final battle in chicago that is nuts but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place the d is well used in spots but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection
