a few years back i was forced to read tess for my english class nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book only a few of us could ever even finish the cliff notes for it our professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into ittess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women yes even at that time this book is overrated and should not be called a classic if you really want to read good literature read dhlawrence read tolstoy read evn modern classical writers like achebe but for crying out loud do not waste your time and money on tess
