we used uber times week orlando vacation instead renting car good results except last trip hotel airport the initial estimated cost ended taking minutes at airport shocked paid receipt showed distance miles trip time minutes map route different one taken we contacted uber promptly refunded extra cost very bizarre i hope isolated incident uber investigates if fare much higher expected may noticed
