basically pale shadow high fidelity witty wonderfully acted film several truly winning character turns watching detectives none that the premise video store geek swept feet quirky mystery woman good one never fully adequately explored thanks weak script miscasting leads mention lack real visual story telling style mean film centered around movies yet incredibly uncinematic that s major failing right there but main problem simply do not care main characters script actors murphy liu fail make true sympathetic real way film becomes series episodes involving two people seem well terribly interesting oh yeah another thing romantic comedy it s funny romance is not terribly romantic either so avoid it even something minute running time it s worth sitting through
