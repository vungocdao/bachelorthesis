anthology always risky business think endeavor praised there s lot talent involved here great many talented actors directors writers unfortunately could not really enjoy movie based three issues had first all segments vary incredibly tone quality unfortunately clash others secondly several segments feel underdeveloped me like seeds good stories never come fruition i m talking happy endings or even ending period rather lack even basic development even solid setups draw in last least feel new york inhabitants properly portrayed what you re left high brow short films may still interest leave average viewer unsatisfied
