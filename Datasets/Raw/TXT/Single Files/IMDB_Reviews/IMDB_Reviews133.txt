first off idea movie made big screen even low budget sci fi channel movie awful friend love action movies independence day jurassic park lotr etc went see movie expecting movie transformers dragons mindless entertainment got mindless hour half cg bad expecting plot awful along acting made it basically chinese legged dragons returning every years sounds like good remake rain fire no plot tries deeper leaving plot holes magic small actual war dragons rather big snakes gets ridiculous director attempted add bit humor movie fail friend laughed whole thing along audience cant believed spent money this short trailer tv makes action crap makes rest i ve seen lot b movies like reptilian cave spider others say want non stop laugh hour watch this story cg acting i do not drink but would helped watching movie
