thought movie fairly well done made tv movie contained lot action humor found entertainment value worth watching would watch similar show again i m disappointed sean credited imdb i see possibility action series based concept sequel sean playing even higher cash stakes since life would line anyway i felt sean played role well reminds actor name matthew ashford plays jack deveraux days lives soap opera
