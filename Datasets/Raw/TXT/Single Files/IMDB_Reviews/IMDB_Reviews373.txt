seems surprisingly high number star reviews people never written imdb review since given low average rating given film people think may draw conclusions this bad film i ll admit it thought concept kind cute pleased see actresses played eve harmony angel getting work did not take long sheer awfulness film make known acting leads seemed competent enough everyone else terrible plot chock full holes big enough drive truck through direction non existent humour really think people going laugh oh boy eye candy ok really beautiful women film three main female characters right across board producers hoped scenery would keep male viewers distracted would not notice terrible everything else was so failed miserably in right hands could cute darkly funny camp classic was not even close
