   "contrary to other reviews i have zero complaints about the service or the prices i have been getting tire service here for the past  years now and compared to my experience with places like pep boys these guys are experienced and know what theyre doing  also this is one place that i do not feel like i am being taken advantage of just because of my gender other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars and have sucked my bank account dry but here my service and road coverage has all been well explained  and let up to me to decide  and they just renovated the waiting room it looks a lot better than it did in previous years"

   "the food is good unfortunately the service is very hit or miss the main issue seems to be with the kitchen the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and its pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints"
