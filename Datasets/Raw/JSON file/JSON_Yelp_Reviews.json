   "contrary to other reviews i have zero complaints about the service or the prices i have been getting tire service here for the past  years now and compared to my experience with places like pep boys these guys are experienced and know what theyre doing  also this is one place that i do not feel like i am being taken advantage of just because of my gender other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars and have sucked my bank account dry but here my service and road coverage has all been well explained  and let up to me to decide  and they just renovated the waiting room it looks a lot better than it did in previous years"

   "the food is good unfortunately the service is very hit or miss the main issue seems to be with the kitchen the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and its pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints"

   "ok let me tell you about my bad experience first i went to db last night for a post wedding party  which side note is a great idea  it was around midnight and the bar wasnt really populated there were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything the two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at kind of counter productive if you ask me   i stood there for about  minutes which for a busy bar is fine but when i am the only one with my card out then it just seems a little ridiculous i made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away i finally had to walk to them to get their attention  i was standing right in front of them smiling and they didnt ask if i need anything i finally said are you working and they gave each other a weird look i felt like i was the crazy one i asked for a beergot the beer  in between that time the other bartender brought food over and set it down she took a fry from the plate right in front of me and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar what the hell i felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks  not an established db   i was just really turned off from that experience   the good is that db provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up i remember going here with my grandparents when i was a kid and it was the best treat ever we would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games this place holds some really good memories for me   its a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards i held for it"

   "i used to love db when it first opened in the waterfront but it has gone down hill over the years the games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality it takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil the atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people now it is run down and many of the games are app related games fruit ninja and d experience rides with such games you cant even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens last time i went back in the winter many of the games were broken which made for a negative player experience i would go to db to play some games again in the future but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets"

   "meh ive experienced better is an understatement  fridays is like the fine dining chain for every yinzer in pittsburgh    when we were seated it was quick which was a surprise  somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why  i was happy about that   i ordered one of their skinny margaritas blackberry to be exact  it was a nice size however at pop that was half of my food bill   the waitress started off attentive but after our food came out she was gone  i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard  loaded mashed potato on the side because i wanted heartburn ha   food came  my burger had lettuce on it only  waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks  i had to wait to ask for my pickle   the loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what i was expecting  disappointment   the waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check    never again will i eat at fridays  i will however go should a happy hour arise"

   "unos has been around for ever  i feel like this restaurant chain peak in popularity in the s honestly the decor inside still kind of looks s to me even though its nice with sleek booth and exposed brick  if you havent died and he recently i ordered you to come back and have a meal here again because honestly the food is really quite good  they have the best chicken salad wrap ever i love that rap so much i want agreed to walk the south side river trail from where the steelers practice all the way to the damn waterfront just because i knew that i could convince my boyfriend to go to unos with me for lunch  full disclosure  i made him call is a cab and we took a taxi back to the parking lot after lunch  listen the food and pizza and service are very good surprisingly so i dont know why this place is not busier but next time youre down at the waterfront please do consider dining here"

   "stars are for the food only     rating  got there at pm on saturday night they told us it was an hour wait which was expected but it only took minutes to be seated so that was a bonus  started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me nowfyilove the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory  i had the singapore rice noodles  this was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better  the fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw   some good notes were the dynamite shrimp plump juicy tangy with a small kick    sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick   the service was annoying   we were there less than  minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there   constantly asking if he could remove my plate  i had to sternly say at one point that i will let you know when i am finished  i found it rude especially since  there wasnt even a line at this point    i think we will travel elsewhere following a movie  the result never quite met the anticipation"

   "when i think bbb i think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tuneup and a few fixes are long gone      this review is more for the repair end of bbb in their defense bbb does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike ie colnago that you just dont find anywhere else in pittsburgh   at bbb i was charged  for a tune up and a few other things granted this included installing a sew up tire which i can understand would cost approx  swapping out a left side big ring shifter on my down tube this should have cost approx  at most and installing new bar tape cost of tape  and  to install so whats with  for a tune up well the story goes like this  i bring the bike into bbb prior to the nice weather hitting pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my oclv trek  ready for the season turns out i dont hear from these guys a week goes by two weeksi think thats ok i have two or three other bike i can turn to for a ride then i wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure ill get a call from them re my bike is ready to rollbut no dice so i call turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was reinstalling the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out is that my fault he says should be ready in a few days so i come in a few days later to this mammoth bill i ask if i am paying for the labor of taping out the screw i dont think i ever got a straight answer i look at the bill and cant see a good breakdown of the charges normally i would duke it over a bill like this but i figuredi had somewhere i to be  minutes ago and at least i finally have my bike i would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over overhauled but it wasnt  well bbb ill give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great nice wrap plus ill toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles maybe i would have rated bbb higher if i was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair"

   "when scoping around online for a good nye dinner destination for my husband and me casbahs prix fixe menu really jumped off the page since the big burrito group is so popular i was happy to get reservations especially since a lot of times were already booked  the hubby and i arrived a few minutes early for dinner i had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that big burrito restaurants have free valet parking  so great especially with slushy snow on the ground even though we were a few minutes early the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately    service was extremely attentive from start to finish waters were refilled quickly bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first the bread came with a delicious spread  was it goat cheese  that i just couldnt stop eating silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced  we ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire nye prix fixe menu none of the eight dishes disappointed the first courses were sea scallops  octopus and duck confit the sea scallop was perfectly cooked the octopus  thought not my cup of tea  was also well cooked and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty i absolutely loved the duck confit dish it was served with mustard greens and fruit with a todiefor dressing  a delicious combination  the second courses were potato gnocchi and mushroom tortelloni the gnocchi was served with lobster which was a unique but nice paring though a strongly flavored dish the tortelloni was delicious and i enjoyed another unique paring tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib  lake ontario walleye and roasted veal strip loin were the third courses both were cooked to perfection the walleyes skin was perfectly crispy and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender however a component of each dish was disappointing  a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal i really cant hold this against casbah though im just not a fan of mustard  finally the desserts was fantastic the chocolate ganache tart was the ending of the sea courses the chocolate was strong even a little bitter and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote i grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish a caramel macaroon completed the land courses the macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce  our experience at casbah was spectacular based on this experience i debated giving the restaurant five stars but decided to wait until i returned a second time and i cant wait to return"

   "i recently bought my first motorcycle a  ktm duke ii and found bohns when searching online for ktm dealers i went in with the intention of buying a jacket helmet and gloves their store is pretty nice inside and they have a good selection of gear mostly dirtoriented though   i wasnt quite sure what i wanted so i asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet she was helpful and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather however a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket which they also sold and she commented that the hated that jacket and that the liner was nothing more than a glorified garbage bag ok  we also talked to a guy at the register about a  ktm  mxc that my friend just bought and asked a simple question about a clutch cable the guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless and im not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was he ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old what  even after that i still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet i liked that they had assured me would be in later that week i then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available but that i could pick another style i then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund  i wanted to like this place but between the thinlyveiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff i dont think ill ever return their prices and selection are pretty decent so if you are in the area and know what you want it might be ok to stop by and pick something up if you have any alternative though i would avoid this place"

   "despite living in pittsburgh for most of my life ive somehow managed to never eat at maxs allegheny tavern until recently    my initial impression of the restaurant was positive  the place had an old neighborhood feel to it a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar and the german murals on the walls made me crave an icycold german lager with a stout head of foam  i thought about how well german potato salad would taste with that beer  so i grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer  and i waitedand waitedand waited some more  for over  minutes before someone came around to take the order  actually that isnt quite accurate  two employees came around  one to the end of the bar and one behind the bar directly opposite me  both of them stared at me  neither one greeted me or asked me what i would have like to order  i stared back incredulously and even made a whats going on here palmsextendedupwardshouldershrug gesture  neither one took the hint  finally a third employee came around the bar and took my order  great i thought to myself finally that beer  she served the beer in a mason jar  wtf  who serves imported german lager at a german restaurant in a freaking mason jar  maxs does  the beer was devoid of its head likely the result of a bad beer pour andor a less than perfectly clean glass an endemic problem with pittsburgh restaurants in my observation  i was sad  i quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu  my first impression of the menu can be summed as follows uhoh  the menu is huge with a number of slowfood stews and braises  the restaurant is more than halfempty  how can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items including more than a few laborintensive dishes freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isnt even halffull  answer they cant  the food isnt fresh  i ordered the wiener schnitzel  i love properly prepared wiener schnitzel  made with fresh butterflied veal breast slightly pounded and seasoned wellcoated in fresh bread crumbs and panfried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside wiener schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food    sadly maxs wiener schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared schnitzel  the veal was superthin had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed and tasted as if it was prebreaded and frozen  it wasnt pan fried either  the breaded frozen puck was simply dropped into a fryolater  where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places which doesnt happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly panfried  the edges of the sad schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate  curly schnitzel  my stomach dropped  my sides german potato salad and braised red cabbage were equally awful  the german potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen  the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup  the bacon in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed possibly faux meat  the potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness  exactly the homogeneity that is found in prepeeled presliced vacuumsealed processed potatoes  it was a gluey sickly sweet mess  i didnt have more than a bite or two  the braised red cabbage didnt taste fresh  it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten    maxs allegheny tavern bills itself on their web site as the best in german fare  the best in service  thats total bullshit  its awful  both for service and fare  if you want good authentic german fare in which the schnitzel is properly panfried to order and delicious join the teutonia mannerchor down the street    ill never return"

   "staying in this hotel changed my entire view on the city of pittsburgh  the hotel is in an extremely vibrant area and i am not embarrassed to admit that pittsburgh is pretty damn cool  the rooms in this hotel are clean and the staff is fantastic  if youre driving parking is conveniently located across the street though the parking garage should come with a set of directions on exactly where to pay when you leave the building or maybe im just more obtuse than the average parker    the hotel restaurant has pretty good food and the bar is a great place to hang out and have some snacks the housemade chips are addictive and enjoy a nice drink  and if you have the great pleasure of having sam as your bartender youre definitely guaranteed good conversation and a few laughs  just make sure you bring up justin biebershe really loves that little fella"

   "my husband and i decided to spend an overnight in downtown pittsburgh last minute we already had dinner reservations and show tickets we just had to find a hotel room the renaissance hotel is literally next door to the byham theatre where we had show tickets i walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer it was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor i came in just as the ceremony was finishing and when they were pronounced husband and wife those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple the hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed but still service incoming guests   check in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while i checked into the hotel i was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late i really liked the makeup mirror since i have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup  we had dinner and enjoyed our show we got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink we got there at pm and waited and waited at  a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table we asked to see a menu but was informed that the kitchen had closed at pm we finished the drinks we had ordered but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night the bartender was a gentleman as i had two bills stuck together when i paid him and he found us outside to return the other one we had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat  other than the snafu in the bar all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional the room was very clean and comfortable as the need comes up i will probably choose this hotel when i need to stay downtown again it is so close to pnc park across the clemente bridge and it is in the heart of the cultural district so all the theaters are very close by it is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far"

   "while i am not much on chain restaurants rock bottom is certainly a place we will be visting again    my boyfriend and dining partner in crime is a huge beer lover  rock bottom offered a great variety that he was pleased with and the brewery atmosphere is really cool  the spirit and wine offerings were also pretty good with a solid variety of wines and the usual spirits with some fun cocktail options  the menu is huge and offers enough to please anyone  our server was extremely sweet quick and very knowledgeable of the menu  she passed the test when she offered solid beer recommendations with food pairings  the food was surprisingly good  we tried the southwest eggrolls to start holy carbs and cheese and then split a salad with flat bread pizza  once we finished dinner we moved to the barwhich i made a note on to visit for game days  spectacular set up with plenty of seating    the gem of this place is actually the bartenders  im sure that its no surprise that if one sits at a bar they are most likely going to chat with the bartenders  these girls were hilarious and carried on great conversation with us without seeming imposing  which is the key to a great bartender  we were enjoying the atmosphere so much we moved our evening plans to rock bottom and had friends meet us there    good food great service great drinkswe will definitely be back"

   "i dont much like the look of this place  i never would have ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews  but they serve some pretty good pizza    i have eaten trillions of pizzas  maybe more i lost count  and im not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza  i grew up in chicago where i was weaned on deep dish pan and thin crust pizzas  i lived in nyc for years and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet  for the record my favorites are difaras in brooklyn and coalfire a relatively young pizza joint in chicago  brixx does a fine job of the thin crust  we had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks  both were pretty tasty    ill go back for more whenever the opportunity arises  but heres what they could do a little better  get that oven hotter and change the flour blend so that theres a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust  theres an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like if that shit dont crack that shit is whack  so when the pizza is folded the bottom of the crust should crack  ditto for the edge of the crust  allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust like spinach ricotta etc  brixxs pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere  it was cooked only to the point of being breadlike  still tasty enough but not quite there  i hate to sound snotty about this but i think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning  that crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible  also the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula but when that was added the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didnt melt at all and the arugula didnt wilt  the result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza  pizza aside they offer local beers at least one nc wine and have ecofriendly waterless urinals in the mens room i applaud the effort though that probably wont be the highlight of the review  next time i go in ill see it they can crispify my pie"

   "great way to spend the th  been awhile since ive been to outback and they have revamped the menu a bit  slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings also at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well  my wife had here favortie alice springs chicken  normally i would go with a beef entree but opted for a new offering of parmesan herb crusted chicken with a side of mixed vegetable  only negative was the bread they served it was a very dark bread that looked with an eastern european bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor  fortunately that was the only downside  my parmesan herb crusted chicken was great  the flavors and textures complimented themselves well  my wife was also happy with her alice springs chicken which again is her normal order at outback  service was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign  atmosphere  what can i say  typical outback  if youre in the carolina place mall area this is a nice spot for dinner and now lunch"

   "for all the hype michaels is quite a disappointment   maybe its because i didnt try the custard but seriously i didnt need more weighing down in this weatherso i ordered an orange crush float instead for something that would have cost me maybe cents to make at home i paid close to  for a oz cup that is ridiculous in general i think their prices are pretty steep for what you getyoud probably have to order a burger to really get a bang for your buck  like rb i also had an issue with the service it was slow disorganized and not very friendly the line was almost out the door but the employees behind the counter didnt even attempt to speed up the service one of them just disappeared into a back room tsktsk i also thought it was hilarious how one of the employees crumpled up an order form before the order had been completed and then had to uncrumple the paper so she could reread the order to her coworker really   anyway i will probably give the monroe st michaels  and their custardsburgers  a shot but im not going to get my hopes up"

   "dont go to this store  the service is always poor the people working there are unfriendly dont know what they are selling where anything is located and to top it off you are likely to be overcharged  so if you do go you best check your receipt  plus they tend to get in your face when questioned about store policy  sure they have the food i want but i can get it in a different friendly store  lose the attitude  what ever happened to good quality customer service"

   "two words overpriced and understaffed  im not sure if palazzo is always open sometimes or just recently reopened but theyve brought back the goth night one friday a month just to clarifynot reviewing that particular dance night just the establishment itself   every time i have been the bar has been understaffed two for an entire nightclub that is packed how does that work it takes forever to get a drink and then its just generally expensive no matter what you get theres also a back bar that seems to never be in use with the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night youd think theyd hire a few extra people   also maybe invest in some misters for your back barit gets ridiculously hot back there when its packed full of people its almost as if this is a bare bones establishment its sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that its at which used to be tranzylvania back in the day just plain sucks"

   "this place was highly recommended by our friends and we were hoping to also like it first off i called and asked if i could bring a small birthday cake for my husbands birthday the lady on the phone said it was not an issue we got there and it was packed on a friday night the hostess said it would be  minutes for a table literally two seconds later there was a four person table cleared i asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us the place was busy and noisy  the menu was limited and average priced for most items i craved noodles so ordered the padseiw the noodles were alright somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower the hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice  later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us  dollars for bringing our own cake nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us  so sadly we will not be returning thai rama has much better food and service"

   "my friend and i decided to try out tgi fridays for a beer during the baseball game to get a bigger bang for our buck for what we would pay for a small hot dog and  oz beer we could get a great meal larger beers and great service right wrong   the restaurant was not very crowded for a game night yet we were denied a table overlooking the stadium twice the manager asked us to visit the hostess stand to get a table but they informed us there was a wait no one was in line for the restaurant   i had to get our own menus from the bar after playing lets avoid making eye contact and maybe she will go away after we ordered three sets of people were sat in the tables we were waiting for and their meals came out before our order   our waiter ended up offering us a free beer for the late arrival of our food and ended up comping our entire check but that will be my last visit front row   id rather pay  for a beer and  for a processed hot dog than to get snobbed by anyone in the service industry all i wanted was a good time after a work day from hell and to enjoy a diamondbacks game "

   "at  pm we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices only one seafood entree fish tacos on the entire  pg card was less than  and that included soups i didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos    entrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas which was a nice surprise  my son had the house specialty  camerones culuchi and i tried a flashfried whitefish served whole with sides for  bucks  we agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable my fish had about  pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish thats not an attempt at humor i can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard  oz can of tuna as if they extracted most of it for their own devices leaving me with little more than skin bones and an eyeball    its hardly a crummy place on the inside  the decor is cute and colorful  service seemed friendly if a bit confused and having grown up in new england  im aware seafood can be pricey  that said after tax and tip we spent  for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch in a hole in the wall just south of roosevelt   judging from the other reviews it sounds like we just came at a bad time but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back two stars for the ceviche"

   "magnifico  great little place tucked away in a semiresidential area of town  felt like i was part of the family after being seated  bright cheerful atmosphere like a fiesta  food was very flavoful even the white rice  crab enchiladas full of white crab meat and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce  salsa you get red spicy and green mild with chips and i got a complimentary cerviche  the red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just the right kick of heat  cant wait to try other dishes when i return to phoenix in a couple of weeks"

   "at the dbgs for the first time ever a couple of months ago to check out the venue for my daughters wedding from the very beginning amber that young lady who worked with us was professional on the ball and organizedfar more than i can say about the wedding planner i believe she must be the parks event coordinator and totally rocked it   the place is truly beautiful so different from what a traditional garden looks like read the other reviews and the other folks will give you a much better idea of the type of plants bugs small animals or as my granddaughter loudly proclaimed  the birds with the hats   there were four other wedding going on the afternoon  but we never really heard much except for some far away music signs were clearly posted leading the way to the wedding site and the rehearsal the night before and the restrooms were exceptionally clean and pleasant to use   there was a very large room with shuttered windows and ac where my daughter and her wedding party dressed and a smaller similar room where the groom and his group readied themselves after the wedding as the chairs and such were put away the entire group came back to the same area which is a small courtyard and had a cocktail hour   my daughter and her husband were married in the far back arena where they have the outdoor concerts and therein lies the only reason this wonderful place does not get five stars   if you have your wedding at this particular site park your car in the dirt lot that is adjacent to the unloading area it is the first right as you come into the park and has a sign posted that reads service area only i understand that during the afternoon the park may want you to stroll leisurely through the park enjoying the natural beauty of the place but at the end of a very long day it wouldve been so much better to park in back and take a  min walk as opposed to an agonizing  min stroll  it was incredibly hard for some of the older folks in the group making their way back to the cars and by the time the wedding ended it was late and the only rangers we saw were on our way out   it was also very dark there and the lights on the canopy over the wedding table did not come on for a long time but eventually they did and it was truly breathtaking you may want to have someone be the on the watch for this so the wedding party doesnt eat in the dark lovely place to have a party or wedding parking not so great   thank you dbg for making my daughters wedding so very memorable"

   "i like their variety in products however they always have peddlers there asking for money and making people uncomfortable but they dont seem to do anything about it  also almost every single time i go to the pharmacy they never have my prescription ready even after theyve called me to tell me it was ready one day i called it in about  days early just to make sure i could stop by anytime before i ran out to pick up my prescriptionit turned out i wasnt able to pick it up until the day that i ran out anyway and even though i had called in three days earlier it still wasnt ready to add to this frustration i have gone in and waited for up to  hours for prescription to be ready when i was told it would only take  to  minutes lastly they have the automatic prescription refill when they call you to tell you that its ready when your prescription runs out i signed up for this however they didnt call me the last time i had a refillb ready because they werent aware it needed to be refilled and the time before that they called me to tell me it was ready and when i showed up it wasnt ready im sick of waiting here and eating my time for my prescriptions i am taking my business elsewhere"

   "the only reason im giving this place two stars instead of one star is because i really had a good appointment with whitney padgett the nurse practitioner she was kind downtoearth smart and a good listener however in the end it was the doctor and one of the front office staff members who are the reasons why i wont return to this practice as a yearold married woman who moved to scottsdale from ca i was hoping to establish a relationship with an obgyn here in the valley so that i already have a trusting relationship with a doctor when my husband and i decide to have a baby i was a happy patient of my last doctor for  years  i scheduled my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was seen by whitney padgett it has always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time going to a specialist i was a bit shocked that i was seen only by whitney and never a doctor at all even though i was new to the practice this aside i returned for a second appointment and this time i saw dr carol hahn i came to my appointment with dr hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment so naturally i was a bit worried from the moment she walked in dr hahn was curt and condescending she spoke to me as if i were below her im a professional working women who is married to a doctor she typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact and at one point corrected me as i was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam however the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if i was a teenage girl are you sexually active i know this is a standard question but my chart indicates that i am a married woman and that i take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention do you think she could have read my chart or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice as i left this appointment i was paying my copay and getting ready to head to work i was told that i could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment i explained that i had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail i was told that i could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there when i explained that im still within the due date and that i have it ready to go in the mail the lady told me that i would need to wait for a manager to approve it before i could leave i told her that i needed to get to work and that i did not have the time to discuss this i put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door i can tell you that i will never return to this practice again from the level of care i received to the treatment and finally the billing practices this place was an unpleasant experience"

   "bottom line scotts has a matzo ball soup so good i cant imagine how anyone could ever hate the jews best bagels in phoenix hands down take your einsteins and shove it scotts has an expansive menu that ranges across breakfast traditional deli offerings and a strong but semi random assortment of home cooking type meals that your mom makes but you never see in restaurants i havent spent a lot of time in delis in new york but scotts reminds me of the new york deli i used to live around the corner from in houston down the street from the jcc  tasty simple and unapologetic about anything i love their soups although their pastrami is not the best ive ever had they have every flavor of dr browns imaginable the portions are huge  too huge actually im minuscule so the prospect of a sandwich that is x what i can eat in one sitting is daunting to the point that i only go if i know i can take a box home the service runs hot and cold but ive never not gotten what i wanted the way i wanted it and if the waitress isnt looking at me with vague disapproval i feel like its not an authentic new york experience"

   "i brought my mini schnauzer here  for grooming and i was not at all impressed i had been here once before and everything turned out really well but something clearly has changed my appt was for am and i was there right on time only to find the doors still locked and no employee in sight when the person finally arrived he asked how i wanted her cut to look and i specifically explained that they can trim her beard but should for the most part leave it longshes a schnauzer he confirmed and told me she would be ready in  hours not too bad i thought although last time it literally only took an hour but i decided i would go across the street to sbux and relax while i waited fast forward  hours and i still had not received a call to let me know my dog was done i decided at that point to go back and check to see what her status was upon arriving the lady grooming her told me she would need an additional  min so again i waited and we left about  min later i noticed at that point gigis beard was a little too short for my liking but figured it would grow it wasnt until i got home and really looked at her that i noticed her beard was completely crookedwth and they left two huge knots of matted fur on the underneath part of her tail granted the rest of her cut looked great but what the heck were you doing for an additional  hours with my dogwith that amt of time she shouldve looked perfect i will not be back to poochies ever again"

   "maybe it was a matinee viewing of get him to the greek last weekend no matter how it happened i have been all about greek food the last few days following up my delicious gyro feta on tuesday i decided to try out cyprus grill right around the corner from my stomping grounds the place is right next to trader joes so i am not sure how i missed it before tonight walking in cyprus has a smallish setup with hardwood floors and some outside seating with misters thankfully   i was immediately greeted by the hostesscashieretc with a huge smile which always lets me know i made a good choice with all of the complaints about customer service on yelp i would think more restaurants would train their staff right and cyprus certainly has do so from an earlier yelp review i knew exactly what i wanted the spartan club a pita sandwich with grilled chicken gyro meat lettuce tzatziki feta and hot sauce with greek fries my new friend offered an upsize in fries but they were bad enough as a side so i was fine with the normal order after about  minutes i was on my way  simply put the sandwich is fantastic i love pita bread and this was soft and tasty but strong enough so it wasnt breaking with the weight of the sandwich the chicken was excellent if not overcooked just a touch and the gyro meat was as good as any i have had the tzatziti sauce was lighter than i like but it and the feta certainly added to the meal the one issue i had with the sandwich was my own fault the hot sauce seemed like a strange addition for it and even though it added a little bite it eventually overcame the spartan dont get me wrong it tastes great but i would probably go without the hot sauce next time  the greek fries were fantastic as well sometimes with greek fries the lemon overcomes the rest of the meal but it was a perfect compliment to the melted feta and seasoning  all in all another great greek meal and well worth the solid price you pay for it"

   "reasonably priced tailor shop when you need alterations done quickly apparently they can also make custom suits but my experiences have been with having pants hemmed waistbands taken both in and out and having jacket sleeves lengthened  generally your work will be done in a week or less there are a number of people working here so you get whoever is free but ive been happy with everyone ive had   one thing i somewhat dislike is that even thought they do have changing rooms they will often do simple alterations without having you try on the item luckily the estimates have so far been right on the money  oh and its cash only so hit an atm before you go"

   "ok so i have lived here for almost a yearand am not renewing my lease for what i pay here i could get a nice house or townhome in the same area i liked the area though and did not realize all the problems i would have upon moving in my sales associate lied to me i asked pretty specific questions upon moving in  upon moving ini was told my apartment was going to be a  bedroom on the third floor with new carpetand paintwell when it came time to move in the apartment i was suppose to get was not ready i had no choice because i had already vacated my last placeso they put me in another apartment with stained carpet shitty paint and tile and it still had furniture in it from the last tenantand stuff in the drawers and cabinetsit had not even been cleaned and it was on the nd floor  how much is the average electric bill i askedthey said no more then  in summermine has been closer to nearly twice as much as what i was paying before i moved here for the same size unit   i asked how sound proof are the walls am i going to be able to hear my neighborsi live on the middle floor they said i wouldnt it is a quiet complex liefirst night the people above me sounded like they were having a zumba class  if you fart to loud your neighbors will probably complainand the office will give you a ten day notice for farting to loud  they failed to mention that the pet rent was a monthly charge not a one time fee and this place is definitely not pet friendly if you own a dog and if that dog barks dont live herethey will try to evict you every week for that one    you will get notices for everything  they also did not explain that i would have to pay for water every month which took them three months just to mail it to me so your rent changes every monthit is never the same amount umyou pay the landlord the water bill not the water companysound fishy  this place sucks on all levels the pictures do not do it justice the apartments are old the kitchen cabinets are s the fountain and grass are all gone filled in with rocks and dirt they landscaping sucks pool is ghetto you can only get sun before pm otherwise it is blocked out by the buildings and it is small it is usually hoarded by fat people and screaming kids and if anything breaksit will take maintenance months to fixbecause they never show up on time   the management office is a joke no one is there to help you they look at you like your a problem i live in the biggest apartment they have and pay the most rent and pay on timeyou think they would try to take care of a tenant like meinstead i get harassed  worst apartment complex ever  do not move in here move anywhere but here"

   "in the world of cakes theres somehow an unspoken rule that if its pretty its okay to be subpar in taste and moistness in my world this does not compute it needs to be as tasty as it is pretty period  so i can only give kudos to the artfulness of a tammie coe cake but nothing more cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it thats not rightyou should be able to eat it alland yummily so if you like the taste of fondant youve got to be kidding meyucky  so take my review or leave it i just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second less of course its for a wedding than it needs to be both equally who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake not me so im putting my foot down and saying i wont eat a cake or cupcake that isnt tasty to me  now i must state that i am more a fan of cake than frosting frosting is secondary to me so if you are more for frosting than for cake ignore my note and have at all the tammie coes and sprinkles of the worldand have mine no really go ahead  if there is frostingfor me and others like me a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception if its whipped cream frosting then bring it on i like frostings more subtler relative so if its a whipped cream iced cake i wont make it a point to get an inside piece or scrape off the icing at all as i would a basic frosted cake  anyway tammie coes cakes or cupcakes dont do it for me if i have to partake in one of her treats id shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake  as for mj bread i have no complaints there their breads really impressed i cant remember which cenpho restaurant i had my first taste of mj bread but i remember being v e r y impressed"

   "about two months ago i needed to get waxed and i would normally head to the brow lady but thought id give the spa a chance since im there daily already i called in advance for an appointment i went in and was led to the relaxation room by the very friendly spa receptionist i had arrived ten minutes early for the appointment hoping she could take me sooner and i could be on my way sooner there was not one other person in the relaxation room with me there also isnt a wall clock and i soon found out why   my extra ten minutes pass no waxer approaches me another ten minutes go by and im sitting there twiddling my thumbs wondering what is going on i decide to go up front and see what the deal is the receptionist says she will find out and i tell her i have places to go and cant wait much longer i go back to the relaxation roomwhich is now not at all relaxing five more minutes passthe receptionist comes to say shes sorry and the waxer will be right with me it was at least another five maybe even ten and i was boiling mad the waxer finally strolled in and of course the waxing itself took a whopping  minutes  sure she was nice enough but she was almost half an hour late for my appointment the receptionist didnt think it was worth comping me the  cost so the waxer received no tip   the second time i used the spa was when i injured my back in one of the classes and had to run crying out of the class there is no sports medicine person on staff as far as i was aware so i hobbled to the spa and found the receptionist in the back of the salon i begged for a massage therapist to help me and she told me no one was there and massages didnt start until am this by the way was at about am im standing in front of this woman having trouble breathing and crying uncontrollably and shes telling me to wait an hour finally she figured out i was not kidding and said shed call around to see who could come in asap she helped me into a chair in the very unrelaxing room and i wept alone there for about  minutes she happened by the door again after that and said that a masseuse would be there in  minutes i had no cell phone watch or wall clock to measure that time nor was any other help offered so i just continued weeping it was am im guessing when another spagoer arrived for her day of treatments and went into the locker room to change i managed to get in there as well after a bit and ask her if she knew the time am   obviously my massage therapist didnt show up until am that would be too bloody much to ask when one has a crippling back injury sure the massage was decent not in price mind you i just feel like my time and money are completely unappreciated and i absolutely will not return there by the way the showers in the spa area are terrible the ones in the locker room are much better and on the whole the bathroomlocker room in the spa is a waste of space"

   "i try not to go to best buy at all cost because im accustom to receive poor customer service when i go there  every now and then i find myself going there because there simply isnt any other retailer who sells certain items  today for example i ordered a logitech bluetooth keyboard online to pickup in store  the website said that the item was instock at this local best buy  i like using the pickup in store option whenever possible because i like knowing ahead of time that they have the item and that its waiting for me  i made my order first thing in the morning and never received a confirmation email  typically you receive a confirmation email no more than  hour after you have placed and paid for your order online  i decided to go to the store to find out that they had my item in the back but that i couldnt have it yet  when i explained that i had plans this evening and that i wouldnt be able to pickup my item later they simply stated that there was nothing they could do  i asked them why they couldnt just go in the back of house to grab my item that i had already paid for but they said they just couldnt do that  this is frustrating for  reasons    it shouldnt take that long to purchase something online to pickup in store and  i dont understand why someone cant simply go in the back to grab the item that ive already purchased  i think i would have been a little more forgiving if the customer service had been better and felt that the person i was speaking with had an ounce of empathy  then again this is best buy  what did i expect"

   "perhaps certain places dont deserve the lowest rating because the person doing the reviewing is not a good fit for that particular kind of place and so cannot review it accurately because of this i gave this place an extra star just in case i am biased against these types of places  now i will paint humanity with a wide brush and put us all into two camps    those who would rather play with a dog outside on the lawn on a nice warm afternoon   those of us who would rather slip outside the backdoor of a rock club in berlin to snort a quick line  let me just say that in my camp we have no use for nor desire to ever return to this outback steakhouse type of establishment  what i truly think about this place is not suitable for public utterance but i will go so far as to say the food was dull the drinks were mixed as if they were for a teething child and not a grown man and the atmosphere looked as if the decorator was commissioned from the school of bathroom design  if you died and went to this place you would not be in hell but you would not be very happy"

   "this location never really disappoints the waitstaff is friendly a manager always asks how things are i stick with outback because the food is consistently delicious   today i ordered an  oz filet classic cooked medium when my steak came out it wasjust not what i pictured it normally looking like it didnt have the dark crusty seared outside it was thin it was cooked about medium wellclose to well and probably due to this it was tough the texture was the worst part because i get the filet for the texture despite the fact that its not usually the most flavorful cut its worth the sliiiiiight loss in flavor for the tenderness the classic seasoning  sort of crunchy seared outside completely makes up for the lack of flavor compared with other cuts   i am not the type of person who sends things back however my boyfriend confirmed my concerns by telling me that he didnt think it looked like a filet so when andrew the manager came by and asked how things were i quizzed him about what cut he thought it was he got it right oz filet i told him i only asked because it wasnt what i was used to a filet lookingfeelingtasting like he agreed that it wasnt ideal and insisted on getting me a new one i told him it wasnt necessary and if it was the filet id eat it despite the lack of the usual outback perfection nopeandrew wouldnt have that he brought a new one the new one was undercooked but since andrew waited to see the inside before leaving it with me he promptly took it back to be fixed    this time it was perfect it was thick like a filet should be and was cooked exactly mediumred in the center but not bloody the searing was precisely what i always look forward to at outback it was the best steak ive had in a long time  i was very happy with the way andrew and our server shelby made me feel like a valued guest and made me feel like it was okay to let them make my order perfect i dont think ill become one of those picky sender backer types but it was nice to know that at this outback location i dont ever have to settle for anything less than perfect   between andrew and shelby this location has secured me as a customer and i will be back next time i want a fantastic steak"

   "dismal abject revolting  these are words one would use to describe the contents of a garbage can or a snuff film you know nice pleasant things that one would enjoy on a sunday afternoon shogun however deserves none of this high praise these words are a lofty goal by their standards   i was so unfortunate to collide unwillingly with this place one saturday for lunch and decided to order the unagi roll and the panko udon i was expecting some common sense from the chefwank they picked up off the street but even hope fails occasionally in an explosion of misery the unagi roll was horrible the rice was not fully cooked the contents were soggy and tasted old the sushi would have been better if the chef had taken the ingredients put them down his pants sat on them for  minutes while riding a bull and then vomited on the resulting creation later the panko udon arrived and it was even worse i understand that it was panko breaded and not a tempura batter but still it was absolutely horrendous they could not have overcooked the vegetables shrimp and fish more  it was greasy bland insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring  the store bought cheap as you can find udon was undercooked and had the texture of noodles that had been sitting for about  minutes in a colander these little beauties were served in a pool of horrific bottled tsuyu sauce that left a lingering chemical aftertaste that was just a delight to behold  i would not eat here again even if my scrotum were stapled to a chair and i was chained to a table i have to give this place one star too many because yelp unfortunately has a one star minimum i would even rate any fast food chain better than this place i have had better airline food  cheers until then get the beers in just not at shogun"

   "we turned to greyhound to get from phoenix to tucson we were going to rent a car but picking up in phoenix and dropping off in tucson for  days was over  at one of the cheaper rental car agencies that seemed crazy so we bought oneway tickets on greyhound for  passengers for about    was there a better deal online interestingly enough the internet special costs more   would we save money on our tickets if we purchased ahead no but mr l bought our tickets a week ahead anyway since the pm sunday bus was the only time that actually worked for us he printed out our tickets which said we were confirmed that sunday would be daylight savings but it was arizona which didnt have a time change  that sunday when we showed up at pm for our pm bus we learned that theyd changed the time to pm the daylight savings in other states affected the schedule we should have confirmed our confirmed tickets the station agent changed us to a pm bus and we were bummed that wed have a few hours to kill and miss out on time with mr ls parents and theyd have to find the bus station in the dark  shoot  lesson learned buying tickets ahead with greyhound isnt the best idea if you do confirm them as the schedule may change  with hours to kill in the greyhound station my son started playing video games at  a pop and mr l and i gathered our thoughts there was some scary looking food sitting under heat lamps in the cactus cafue we rented two lockers to stow our luggage for  each for  hours and split in a cab for a while to go anywhere but the bus station  when we returned closer to our new departure time the lines for the buses were confusing the line for tucson was not the line for our bus it seemed like everything was backwards here luckily we asked or we mightve missed our bus again by the time we boarded our bus many seats were taken ichabod headed to the back of the bus and a kind gentleman cleared the seat rear spot for us   there was a bathroom near the back which mr l suggested i avoid entering he said it was a basic hole outhouse style with an empty jar of handsanitizer good to have the barebones bathroom if you really need it but ick  the driver made a bunch of announcements in english then in spanish he meant business i was glad when he told passengers to use headsets for their music since initially a nearby passenger graced us with his music now we only got to see his seated dance moves which were actually pretty good    affordable prices  capable driver  changing the schedule after had a confirmed ticket  for only one agent working the line   having a bathroom on bus  condition of bathroom  lockers in greyhound station  for the clusterfck of confusion of lines to get on buses  advanced degrees dont help here be ready to ask questions  grand total  stars  overall we were glad not to spend over  on a rental car or inconvenience our friends or family by asking for a very long ride we learned that we need to confirm or buy tickets lastminute like most greyhound riders hanging out in a greyhound station is not my idea of fun we would ride greyhound again but proceed with caution"

   "after many years of searchingwith no luck i was searching for a nice place to take my wife for a date when i came across sakana the site where it was listed offered no reviews or information besides a few pictures and location i decided being the risk taker that i am to give it a whirl we arrived at a little holeinthewall place tucked into a small strip mall outside we found a packed parking lot and a line at the door on a tuesday   sakana was just opening for dinner service and despite the tuesday dinner rushstill makes me chuckle we were seated swiftly and with choice as to where we sat once nestled comfortably at the sushi bar we were greeted by ramon not my idea of a sushi chef but boy was i wrong    itamae doesnt quite describe the skill level ramon was on he was masterful and strangely i was not put off by him at all when he engaged me in conversationi am not a public people person ramon you are great at what you do   now we are at the most important part of the journey the food which was delicious we ordered sever different types of sushi eel blue fin egg and octopus lets start with the bad first octopus i personally hate it always chewy tough and so citrusy i cant bear it so thats the bad now for the good blue fin melted in your mouth with the consistency of firm butter and was excellent the egg was great aswell sweet with a back end of head dizzying sakenot over bearing but noticable if you dont drink   now for my favorite part of the meal eel saying that i am an eel lover is an understatment i dream of good eel all i can say is that i was impressed and thats the highest compliment i could ever give to eel because ive never had bad eel also had a crunchy eel roll that was superb   my wife ordered calimari and ramen both of which were delicous aswell the sauce for the calimari was my favorite part of the plate as for the ramen if you want good authentic ramen with a smell that will cause people to come up to you and ask you what that is that you ordered look no further   all that for under  what ive paid over a hundred for far worse   after years of searching i have finally found my sushi destination thank you ramon for the many wonderful times you have provided us with we will be back soon  ps i have never left that place with out atleast one thing gratisfish ribs were great but im too lazy to eat them"

   "ok i had to write a review because i was very disappointed  i gave this place the benfit of the doubt only because i heard they had a great happy hour and it is a brewery plus they only had  stars when i looked over the yelp reviews i wanted to help improve thatbig mistake i shouldve listened to my fellow yelpers i decided to have my birthday dinner here on a friday we decided we would meet early for happy hour then move to dining area for dinner well my small party of  got there around pm we thought it was just in time to put in a quick order for cheap food and drinks but it took forever to find an available server one guy stopped by and said hell be back in a sec but never did so we decided to move to the patio where we thought it would be easier to put in our order the lady taking orders was nice enough to put our order in  minutes before it ended we were rushed and didnt even have the hr menus to look over because they guy never gave us them and there werent any on the patio table she was also pretty slow at getting them im sure we wouldve had  minutes to order if she knew the urgency of hr ending at pm  come on nowthere were alot of older people and it got pretty dead after hr ended  after that we moved to the dining area where other members of our party met us the menu looked good from the pictures and description they gavebut the beer selection was very limited  white ale red ale dark ale ok at least put some personality into naming them and make sure your server is educated on each beer  over all the food sucked and beer sucked no taste in either one it was a sad birthday dinner yes i ate all my food because i was starving i didnt get sick so thats good we had one beerdrink each and regreted the beer choice after the first sip we left right away to get a real drink oh i did have a choice of either a free cake or drink for my bday i chose the carrot cake it was good not the best she just sat it down on the table said happy birthday then walked offuh thanks yay happy birthday to me oh and she charged us for the cake but corrected it after we mentioned it   i know better now to stick with the good ol four peaks brewery for great food and beer  they have an extensive selection of beer to choose from even if it isnt made in their brewery  servers hostess were nice except for mr invisable   just dont gomaybe for hr but you wont taste much  excuse my spelling and sentences just so much happened and i cant think right trying to get it all out"

   "if i have to review the food alone i will give it a one star  the service is prompt and courteous so ill give it an extra one star  lets start from the beginning  we had a reservation and was seated promptly  the waiter came and greeted us gave us the menu and everything went well  appetizer we started with the alp  dell cheese fondue which is a white wine and gruyere raclette and fontina cheese fondue it tasted two dimensional exactly garlicky and salty  the raw cauliflower and carrot which i usually love to eat tasted bitter with the cheese  salad we went with california salad which is mixed salad greens with raspberry vinaigrette dressing  the salad came very watery very very sweet and it was swimming in the dressing we could not even finish it off  main course this is the worse of all the courses we picked the pacific rim cooked in coq au vin broth  it came with teriyaki marinated sirloin citrus pork tenderloin shrimp chicken pot sticker mushroom and veggies  we deliberately chose coq au vin broth even though it cost more because we read here that its worth it everything tasted bland and that citrus pork and teriyaki sirloin tasted very weird sour and salty and not in a good way at all  the chicken and the shrimp also tasted bland  it really tasted like boiled chicken meat thats a bit salty their solution  dip it in our sauce teriyaki sweet and sour and yogurt based curry sauce  the sauces tasted like cheap sauces you can find in a bottle in any grocery stores it has no character no complexities  very very disappointing  oh yeah this is what our waitress said  just cook everything about  minutes or so dont worry if you dont time it correctly its impossible to overcook anything here just leave it on the pot and thats fine  this is not just the cooking instruction for  our table  we can hear that every table get the same cooking instructions from different waiterwaitress  the problem is not overcooking for us but it just tasted bland  dessert we chose the smore with dark chocolate fondue  this is the best part out of this horrible feast  it comes with strawberry graham cracker marshmallow cheesecake pound cake and rice crispies to dip it with first the strawberry was fresh marshmallow was great graham cracker was crunchy  now come the bad part the part that they had to make the rice crispies was kinda stale the pound cake was crumbling like a week old cake and the cheesecake was just meh  we suddenly realized that the part that was good they did not have to make ie the strawberry the cracker and the marshmallow  the part that they had to make tasted bad ie the crispies cheesecake pound cake    we do not mind splurging on our foods on special occasion  we realize that it takes a lot of efforts to make special dishes  this is seriously lacking in everything cheap basic material for the food horrible taste and no cooking method involve at all by the kitchen  why are we paying that much again  i dont mind paying  for a meal if it is cooked properly and tastes great  its not the price at all its just there is no value to this meal"

   "note our stay could have been an entirely different experience had we not booked a stay the weekend after a livingsocialcom deal was made available  we did not buy that deal we were regular customers  ok starting at the beginning     checkin is pm  we got there at pm arrived to a line of no less than  people  no rooms were available for us  they temporarily checked us in and said we could go to the water park and call back in an hour to see if a room was ready but the only place to change was at the athletic club clear on the opposite side of the park  by the time we hiked over there and back it was pm  our room wasnt ready until  we called about  times until they finally had one ready     the room was hot  it was on the top floor and really never cooled down even after we removed a gross dirty air filter ill be posting a picture in case youre into looking at icky stuff  if youre one of those people who likes it very quiet to sleep top floor is bad   also on the noise topic our bathtub dripped so bad it sounded like the faucet was on a slow trickle the whole time  water wasters  side note the bathroom was so small you had to step out of the way to shut the door  a large person might need to step into the tub to shut the door    gross there were several places of sticky on the carpeting   were right in places where normal people put their feet all the time so that was annoying and nobody should have been in that room until that was cleaned but they were completely sold out because of the livingsocialcom deal   the railings along the walkways to our room seem flimsy to an acrophobe like me  if you have small children or rowdy older kids you might ask for a room on a different floor  a lower floor closer to the ground safer   the oasis water park was ok but the staff had no continuity  one person would allow a  child to ride the slide another wouldnt  one day they didnt care if your floats were by your seats while you ate lunch the next day they were collecting them just for getting out of the water  and so on and so forth  and any time you get a bunch of people staying at a resort they wouldnt normally be able to afford youre going to get a class of people that are subpar  we saw at least  instances of people just taking other peoples chaises even when they clearly had their personal stuff shoes shirts stored there  there was considerable pushing and shoving to get in the water lots of unsupervised rude  year old kids  all of this was a nuisance that probably is not a regular issue    the hotel did try to make right by us  we only complained about having to wait for a room for so long and they ended up cutting our hotel rate in half which was then less than those livingsocialcom folks and giving us vouchers for drinks  and enough vouchers to cover our lunch for  people  so they were aware of how screwed up things were  we didnt complain about the room or the park as it was so incredibly busy it didnt seem worth it"

   "ive never had a great experience at macaroni grill but decided to try it again since i heard their menu had changed  the menu may have changed but thats all thats changed  we sat for a good  minutes before the manager came over to take our drink order saying our waitress was bogged down with other tables  i looked around and the bartenders were waiting on other tables  it looked like there were only  waitresses in the entire restaurant i ordered fettucine alfredo and was disappointed immediately when it arrived because they had ground up pepper sprinkled all over the top of it  why would any restaurant put pepper all over someones food  well apparently they did it to disguise the fact that their alfredo sauce has absolutely no flavor  none at all  i have had alfredo pasta at fast food italian places and its been better than this  my husband ordered the chicken milanese and it was covered in some sweet sauce that did nothing for the chicken  the best part of the entire meal was the potatoes that were served with my husbands chicken  they were really good   overall it was a complete waste of an hour of my life and   i will never go back again oh and ps  who serves water in gross bottles with no ice  yuck"

   "aah old country buffet one of the first buffets i ever went to growing up as a matter of fact this and the superstition springs one were the two i went to  about maybe  years ago we went to the s springs location  we went there probably once a month and enjoyed it each time  until one day we noticed the rotisserie chicken wasnt cooked all the way  all my mom did was ask the waiter to tell the cook that the chicken wasnt cooked all the way  then they got the manager and he scolded us saying well you guys are just trying to get a free meal  after a little big of an argument mellow on my moms side we left  last time i ever been to one until a couple weeks ago  anyways enough about the past  went here for a lunch one day just you know see if it changed at all  walked in the door and totally remember the winding entrance be quiet its nostalgia for me  were greeted and seated right away  i remember the big drink station in the middle  there were a lot of tables of course then i looked at the buffet  wheres all the food  i know it was lunch time but the buffet was way small  ive been to dozens of buffets since this place and this place is childs play compared to others    the quality of the food is pretty much the same since i last remembered maybe a slight less  probably wont come here again though theres other buffets out there"

   "i came here early sunday  the place was almost empty i got a table right away i had a boston tealike a arnold palmer but with cranberry it was pretty good service was prompt and attentive yet not overbearing and annoying i ordered the crab steamer pot crab shrimp corn cob potatoes and scallops the crab was crisp shelled sweet and tender the shrimp was yummy and cleaned well the sauce that it all came inbutter and white wine was rich and delicious the scallops were well done and not gritty the potatoes were quartered and had a great crispy crust that absorbed the sauce well my only complaint wad that the corn was a bit over done for my taste but i like mine very crunchy the cheddar bay biscuits were great and bottomless to boot when i left the place was packed get here early my check was  and i left happy full and satisfied if yer not a seafood snob and you realize that yer in the middle of the desert try this place for a reasonable priced and above average seafood meal"

   "we visited streets of new york while on vacation in phoenix  it is a casual place  their menu is quite interesting and i was pleasantly surprised at their pizza  although not true new york style it is a very thin crisp crust they also have a handtossed option but that has no place in a new york pizza joint in my opinion  the meatball appetizer was very good and the pizza was great their menu seemed to have plenty of other options as well  like i said great food great pizzajust not true new york style  the reason for only two stars is because their service was awful  we went on a sunday night  they were not busy at all  in fact while we were waiting  minutes for someone to even acknowledge us two waitresses were busy rolling silverware into napkins and chatting  when we were finally able to get someone to wait on us it was clear this girl had no idea what new york style pizza even meant  youd think if that was the name of your restaurant you might want to educate your wait staff what in fact that meant  finally it took forever to get the check of which she had to be reminded twice  remember that they werent busy  had they been i might be a little more forgiving  its a shame that they receive only two stars solely because of poor service  but in todays world even with great pizza good customer service should be the norm not the exception"

   "okay here it goesthis may get long winded but i swear it is a truthful and honest review so please read closely  i lived at lakeside formerly known as lakeside village for over  years through  and i saw the old management company con am get bought out by another management company called madrona ridge con am wasnt the best but things went downhill when madrona ridge took over  when i first moved here they were literally giving apartments away they were offering less than  per month for a  bedroom in a nice part of town with a lake view so it was a good deal for the first  years there it was pretty solid the managers knew my name they cared about my problems and fixed anything i needed immediately im talking same day service they were nice people con am and the old managers were nice to me and actually tried to show customer serviceunlike the new management  around the time madrona ridge took over things just got ratty loud and creepy people started moving in bringing all of their loud and creepy friends with them supposedly they have a no crime policy and wont rent to criminals yet the very loud and vocal neighbors loved to talk about their duis and jail time a lot more weirdo people started showing up and walking around at night i saw a drunk guy smash someones windshield in a fit of rage and sped off and someone did a nice hit and run on my car while it was parkedand of course nobody picked up their dog poopat all the landscapers didnt care to pick it up the maintenance guys didnt care so there it sat madrona ridge promised all previous residents even better service than con am gave i was wrapping up a lease when madrona ridge took over and they offered me an okay deal so i stayed but right after they started to get sloppy and dissapoint they hired the current girls who manage lakeside a few months later and their awful service started to show   the current staff working here are probably the slowest rudest most impersonal women around these girls traci and lucinda are not right for this job they are not friendly or easy to deal with at all when you have a question or concern they are not accommodating or welcoming no smiles just a bland i dont care attitude if you do anything to displease them or make them think hard they will treat you like dirt they also wont bother remembering your name or showing you any kind of human service theyll just call you hey or you also if you have a problem or a concern be sure to just walk in and demand to talk because they dont listen to their voicemails or return phone calls    ive had problems with bugs repairs questions and rarely did they return a call or get anything moving unless you tell them again and again in the early days when i needed something fixed conam would have it fixed in a day or two these girls will make sure it takes over a week if youre lucky so either get good at fixing your own stuff or be prepared to wait because as these managers know you arent that important seriouslyhow hard is it to fake customer service at least try to remember someones name and care a little bit a fake smile anything helps especially in a sales positionyou kill more flies with honey than vinegar fyi  i left when they offered a renewal notice at the end of my lease they offered me a new lease agreement that was absurd and overpriced the one bedrooms here are  square feet just tiny little run down apartments from the s and they are now asking  per monththat doesnt include taxes pet rent if you have em and utilities so basically they are charging around  per month for a  sq foot hole in the wall in an old crumby complex when you can go find a nice new cleaner mark taylor or other luxury apartment for only a few dollars more per month uhhh yeah no thanks lakeside i did just that and found a better nicer newer place for only pennies more than here    do not believe the website it is totally false advertised what you see online is not what you will get in person what youll really see are outdated appliances from the s peeling paint popcorn ceilings cheap carpeting tiny closets and no storage space   lakeside used to be a lot better i used to love it at first and im grateful for the good times i had while it lasted the management used to be nicer the grounds used to be cleaner and the prices used to be reasonable this place has delusions of grandeurthe managers think its a luxury complex and are charging people ridiculous luxury prices for run down ugly little apartments that are not worth their price tag and the service you get isnt worth a dollar   the area is pretty good and the lake is pretty at night time there are nice walkways and some handy shops nearby but honestly look elsewhere if you want both quality and value"

   "after going to see eat pray love of course there was nothing i was craving more than authentic italian food ive been here before for lunch and dinner so pestos was the first place that popped into my head this place apparently has been around for years and im not surprisedtheir food is amazing i ended up getting takeout rather than braving the bar solo theres also a separate dining area and ordered the linguini with white clam sauce it was to die for mozzarella sticks with marinara olives not a huge fan of the sesame bread that comes with it and of course a cannoli for dessert the linguini was perfectly done and the clam sauce was amazing with just the right amount of clams the mozzarella sticks were soso nothing special about them that i was thinking i should have gotten the stuffed mushrooms insteadthese i know are worth itoh well next time the olives an appetizer were a delightful blend of  or so different types and it definitely hit the spoti love olives they come with sesame bread which im not really a fan of but i was craving carbs so i smothered some butter on it and was over it pretty fast now i have never had a cannoli as delicious as the ones ive gotten from pestos ever these are absolutely meltinyourmouth amazing from the chocolate chips inside to the crushed pistaccios outside sprinkled with a little powdered sugar and a fresh crispy shell your mouth will thank you everyone that works here is absolutely amazing its a family business and their pride of ownership shows in everything they do ive never had bad service here and even when theyre overrun with the high schoolers note to self dont go during setons lunch hour their service has always been topnotch i highly recommend checking them outeven if it is just for an amazing cannoli "

   "if you want to be yelled out and called a liar go to rsvp realty  a few months into a rental agreement the ac went out during a heat wave in august  rsvp told us to stay in a hotel and they would reimburse us for up to   a few weeks after we submitted our receipts for two days we received a letter stating that the tenants were responsible for the motor breaking and attached the  bill  and the hotel would not be covered  when my roommate and i spoke to rsvp we were told that we were to blame because the filter was not replaced  we communicated that the filter was replaced last month and he told us we were lying   he not only backed out on his commitment to fix the repair and reimburse us for the hotel but blamed us for the old air conditioner going out on a hot az summer day  i am not only completely appalled by the shady company but appalled by the lack of professionalism in yelling at us calling us liars and that the landlord wants to evict us    when talking to the owner of the home she profusely apologized for rsvps unprofessional behavior and lies   i will never use rsvp realty for any business and will share this story with people"

   "i dont think my fiancue or i will ever return to a black angus we dont go out oftenso when we want to do something special on the weekends we want to skip the dishes end enjoy some fine cuisine and have a pleasurable evening together howeverour last experience was anything but  we went to the black angus located in chandler arizona on march th so  and a half weeks ago from this point it it seemed like a normal enough place and we were shown to our table one of the first things we noticed and my fiancue asked about was if the place used to be an ihopas the tables seemed to have that kind of quality to them  our waitress emily arrived gave us our menus and asked us what wed like to drink as we usually do we ordered lemonades emily said that they had strawberryraspberry lemonades and thinking this was just a flavor we said sure she promptly returned with our lemonades and i will admit we were pleasantly surprised we just expected it to be a reddish colored drink but this had real fruit in it so being as thirsty as i was there was no water on the table up to this point i downed mine in a quick fashion and asked for a refill she then said shed bring me back a water with the lemonade because they were  a refill we were shocked we just wanted lemonade period we didnt know wed ordered special lemonades that were three dollar a drink we reluctantly allowed her to get another one because we didnt know if there were any normal lemonades at this pointsince after all thats what we thought we asked for we looked at the menu which to me was horribly overpriced and i asked my fiancue if she was sure this is where we wanted to eat since she was just trying to go with the flow of it she said itd be fine and that it wasnt a big deal if only  we ordered the  for  meal deal that offered an appetizer  sides per meal and then the entree per each person we got our sampler and were not impressed it was okay but ive had the same kind of thing at applebees and other restaurants  when we finally got our mealswellthats when things started to go from bad to worse one of the things i noticed when i ordered my meal which was a disappointment was that the biggest sized steak available in this meal deal was a  oz new york or ribeye not what id call large by any means when i looked at my steak and began to cut it up i managed to trim off about  of it in fat alone and the portions of the sides were on the small side my fiancues meal was not much better the grated parmesan looked and tasted odd and somehow to her utter amazement they managed to screw up the green beans somehow even two weeks later when we mention all this to people she still cant understand how someone can fail to cook green beans in such a way that they taste horrible the food overall was of average quality and not what wed expect from a place like black angus  our waitress made a guest appearance once or twice with the second time being to deliver the slice of cheesecake to top off our meal so we were left wondering half the time if we had a waitress at all  finally we elected to tip the waitress  of our bill since some of the problems were not hers and we didnt want her to have a bad evening which might boil over into someone elses bad meal experience this took our total bill of  up to a bit over    we were not thrilled with our visit to the establishment as you can see so we decided wed go home and leave a comment on the website listed at the bottom of the receipt like most restaurants have when i put in the website i was confused why is it asking what my opinions are on various combo ideas when i had a bad experience i discovered this was the entire purpose of the website i had to actually go to the black angus website and merely leave a comment  at this point we were fairly content to leave it at that now that we gave some feedback but the manager of the restaurant matt decided to contact us to discuss what happened and see what he could do to make it right i told him i didnt believe it was his or emilys fault about the prices as they are decided by someone higher up in the food chain no pun intended but it would have been nice to have been informed about the refill price on these special lemonades larger portion sizes and for the staff to be a bit more attentive its odd having to share a water at a place where it averages  a person i always believe in second chances but my fiancue was a bit harder to convince i succeeded as matt offered to send us a gift card   over a week passed by and nothing showed up in the mail i actually had to contact matt to find out what was going on and if one was sent at all he said hed forgotten it in his car but it would show up soon okaythats fine things happen then it showed up today a  gift card we found it insulting i dont know what we expected but not this"

   "i always like to try new restaurant after reading yelp with some mixed reviews i went on and bought a groupon  for  deal and thought it was a good deal it was my bf and i first time at ninjas the place was empty we were greeted by a very sweet waitress the first thing i noticed was the chefs i thought well its ok not all sushi restaurants have to have japanese chefs to make it good does that make me a sushi snob   the first thing our waitress ask if we have a groupon why does that matter i thought i said yes and she gave us the menu we look at it but nothing sounds appetizing is it a different menu cause we have a groupon we decided to order a lot just in case i think ive ordered about  rolls sushi and sashimi but when our food arrived it didnt seem enough our waiter didnt tell us what was on the first plate then the second round he just drop it off on our table and we have no idea what wed got the rolls were just medico nothing fancy or tasty i thought they were all bland felt like the foods were made from sushi  cookbook my bf loves sushi and can sit forever eating them but by the third plate he said he was done and wanted to get the rest home i was very surprised when the bill came it was over  without drinks i gave our waiter our groupon and it came down to  i felt like we were gypped cause i dont think we recieved all the food weve ordered i look at the order sheet and some wasnt cross off and we werent even stuffed  it doesnt take a lot for me  also we have very little leftover i would have check with our waiter but my bf didnt care for the rest of the food he didnt enjoy them anyway so when i thought about it all i spent way more than i wanted too just to try a new place and leftover i dont think neither of us would eat again this is one reason why my bf dont like to sway away from our favorite place with that the amount  we spent we could have gone to our favorite place twice thats what he said  needless to say i wont be coming back but if youre not a sushi snob and for  all you can eat sushi this place might be for you"

   "as jesse j said we went here last night for some sushi after i had looked here on yelp and man was it worth it so far this is probably the best sushi i have had in arizona  my favorite roll was the big and spicy roll the flavor was just amazing with the seared salmon and yellowtail on top with the pickled jaleneno the sauce on it was amazing as well this is one where no soy sauce is needed  also ordered a spicy tuna but asked him to go a little on the spicy side and he obliged and it was a nice fiery roll but not so much that the taste of the tuna got lost it but some burning on my tounge but was amazing  the rest of the meal was jut as good especially the tsunami roll which i can best describe as a vegas roll minus the cream cheesei am no a fan of cream cheese in sushi with its own special sauce the sauce was a great mix of hot and sweet where you got a bit of a kick but it was cooled quickly even people who dont do spice will like this  the only things preventing this from being a  star place was that i never got the water i ordered and some of my miso soup was cold i think the tofu had not been in long enough a return visit is planned soon and could easily up this to  stars"

   "our favorite waitress is back as is the old manager john i think they must have had an off night with a new manager subbing and it went dreadfully wrong we decided to try it again after they introduced a reward program and were pleasantly surprised   i had one great meal same items as last time went back a couple of weeks later and tried something different the italian classics delicious however i tried it again the following week and was disappointed the chicken parmesan was burned like dark brown bubbled cheese and the lasagna was unruly and tasted like it had cream cheese in it or something this time it just kind of stayed on your tongue too long after taking a bite and was strangely creamy weird   so ill just stick with the calamari sausage lentil soup and sirloin marsala   i guess i update my review to say when they are on their game everything is fantastic but they can really have off nights occasionally i guess like many places"

   "goodness gracious flancers is not for the light eater or the small stomach   it took me far too long to stop into this tiny little shop considering that i live ever so close and am always complaining about the lack of awesome food in this area  the menu was so impressive that i had to have my server come back three times because i could not decide what to order   i ordered the blta with fries and let me tell ya i dont know how anyone gets through an entire sandwich  i snarfed down the amazing fries and half my delectable sandwich and had to box the rest  i could hardly get into my car and dont tell anyone but i definitely unbuttoned the ole pants once i was out of public view  omg  my onestar deduction is because upon arriving home i flopped onto my bed for some rest because my stomach was working overtime on the blta and next thing i knew it was  am i lost my entire evening to my sandwich    all discomfort aside the food was outstanding the prices were right for the quality of the meal and i will definitely be back to try other items on the menu as soon as i can budget out the time to recover afterwards"

   "i had heard a lot about flancers from the mouth by southwest blog and was interested to try it  i had heard of multiple tap takeovers and other events so i was excited to see what beers they had on tap  all that stuff must have been at the other flancers location because this location didnt look like it even had taps or a bar  my husband ordered an imperial ipa from new belgium that he thought was pretty good in a bottle and i ordered the prickly pear spiked lemonade  there was not much prickly pear flavor but you could tell the lemonade itself was fresh squeezed    the sandwiches were the real highlight of our visit  i got a sandwich with pork arugula tomato relish and onions  it was amazing  the bread was incredibly soft but it still had a chewy outer coating so the sandwich didnt fall apart  my husband got the philly and he really liked it  he is very hard to please when it comes to philly sandwiches  he was a huge fan of the bread  i really liked the green chili mac and cheese too  the jalapeufo mashed potatoes were insanely hot but if youre into that they are right up your alley  i would love to try more of flancers sandwiches"

   "first i want to say from my experience chompies food is very good not excellent but very good  the service on the other hand was very poor  chompies is a bit on the expensive side if there service was good i might accept that but with poor service i cant give it higher than  stars   i went to the bakery during lunchtime on sept th it was busy so i waited in line like everyone else as i moved along in line i was asked for my order which included a few bagels some cookies and a takeout sandwich  so im pulled out of line by one lady who want to ring up my order at this cash register at the stat of the line not at the end of the line where you usually pay  i start to take out my wallet and she tells me credit card only if i want to pay with cash  i have to get back in line and wait for the other cash register  ok i give her my credit card to pay but im thinking that was annoying   she tells me my takeout order will be ready soon it was a simple bagel sandwich  so i wait and wait and wait  minutes later i ask the lady for the status of this and it turns out the lady never sent the order to the kitchen so of course its not going to be done   more minutes and its finally done  they need to get a bit more organized and provide better service or i can tell you i will never be back  there are too many other good places around to deal with one that couldnt care less about my business"

   "as soon as i walked into arrivederci in scottsdale i felt welcomed  the cute bustling italian restaurant was cozy but elegant with lots of chatter and linencovered tables and the staff at the door and servers were superfriendly the spot is locally owned with a second location in ahwatukee and my pal and i got a nice table in the corner of the restaurant to enjoy the homemade italian food at  we both liked how there were wine racks dividing the main dining area from the bar area and there were pretty paintings covering the walls while the restaurant glowed in a soft yellow light our server was excellent and professional and id say its a great date place if youre in the area  we started with the portobello reganato con fontina  a mushroom topped with cheese our server said it was one of their most popular appetizers and i can see why it was plenty of food for two people to split and had a ton of cheese the mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish and i really enjoyed it  our meals came with freshly baked bread and i ordered ravioli caprese gratinati  it was a pretty traditional cheese ravioli and nothing really stood out to me about the dish though my companion really liked the fresh tomato sauce it was smothered in the pasta was thick but a great consistencythere wasnt anything wrong with it but ive just had more memorable meals  my guest got the vitello madeira con porcini  which was veal covered in a mushroom wine sauce and served with pasta he said he would have preferred a cream sauce instead which is totally available to you but he really liked the veal  for dessert we had the epic chocolate tiramisu the spot offered it was a giant slab of my favorite dessert and it tasted pretty heavenly definitely get it if you go herei could have eaten the whole thing myself  my favorite part about dining at arrivederci was definitely the atmosphere and the service i love places that make you feel at home and arrivederci certainly does that with zero pretentiousness from the staff and i also appreciated the casual elegance vibe the place had not to mention im still dreaming of that dessert"

   "i was up there last week with a group of friends and volunteered to be the designated driver for the night it was a  cover to hear the house band which was no biggy and then i asked for a diet coke which was another  again no problem paying for the diet coke after about  minutes and some dancing i went up to the bar for a refill of the diet coke expecting the refill to be free the bartender told me it would be another  i mentioned that i was the responsible one for a table full of people drinking and that i thought the point was not to encourage drunk driving and to encourage people being responsible well that got me nowhere so i asked for a glass of water instead i was told that the bartender couldnt give me water because it was a two drink minimum to get water  now its july in az and i had been dancing we had a table full of people drinking and ordering their drinks from this same bartender who cant give me a glass of water really i dont mind paying the cover and the cost of the first diet coke im not being cheap but the point is that most bars appreciate and take care of the designated driver i was being responsible and they couldnt even give me a glass of water  really"

   "total rip off i went into the store for a price quote on a new motor and some replacement cartridges and they gave me a reasonable price but when i called them to come out to do the work they charged me an extra   on the cartridges then what they had quoted they would cost the repair man also did not bring the replacement motor that was ordered so he could charge me for an extra  minutes while he drove back to the store to get the motor he had forgotten i was also told that the new motor would come with a new pump housing in the original quote which it did not when i called to ask the manager about the pricing he was immediately standoffish and hostile i couldnt believe that they treat their customers this poorly the repairman had done about   minutes  of work and they charged me  dollars in labor alone not to mention a price increase of about  for all the parts quoted for about  more bucks i could have replaced the entire system i would advise anyone looking to have their pool serviced to go else where and avoid this dishonest company"

   "traditional s style italianamerican food in a strip mall mainly notable because you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee  dont believe the hype  this place is nothing special  contrary to the many reviews here that comment on how cheap it is i found it a bit expensive for what youre getting which is not exactly nuova cucina   for two small nonhomemade cannelloni a la carte is not a bargain in my book  their linguine with white clam sauce is some canned clams tossed with a copious amount of oil  a cup perhaps and some boxed pasta for   the  insalata romana is a plate of tired iceberg lettuce a tomato wedge or two and a few shreds of bland cheese swimming in a very tart vinaigrette     this is the kind of food that used to represent italian food in america before the food revolution of the s  the kind of place youd find not in new york or chicago but in terre haute or tampa at a time when eyetalian food was still considered a bit exotic  the many reviews stating that this is real homemade italian food are a bit puzzling since its neither homemade nor italian  this is very oldfashioned prefoodie italianamerican food and while its ok for what it is it certainly isnt real italian food by any stretch of the imagination nor is it for the most part homemade    nb no a visit to this restaurant is not just like going to italy  for that matter its not just like going to little italy  i realize phoenix is not exactly a mecca for italian food but wtf people      the mostly  crowd seems to love it  i can only guess that they are overwhelmed by nostalgia for a simpler time because while it may not be kierland pretentious nor a crappy chain restaurant the food just isnt very good  seriously   the servers have a strange attitude that i guess is supposed to be eastcoast or something rushed cocky borderline rude but seems a bit out of place in what is basically a mom and pop strip mall joint serving canned food with plastic red checked tablecloths and thin paper napkins  in any case they are very selective with their attention and you can wait quite a while to get something  also as several other reviewers have pointed out they give you a nonitemized bill with just the total due written on it which seems to include an extra  or so with no explanation offered   this seems quite bizarre to me but apparently no one objects  at this restaurant      somehow add up to   the nonitemized bill is a weird affectation at best  why would you do that especially in a cheap joint like this  but to do that and then miscalculate  theres a word for that in italian  its imbrogliare    for two with tip for a simple shared salad and two pasta dishes with no meat and no drinks"

   "weve tried this place several times in the past few years and each time that we do i end up kicking myself for giving it another shot  i just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here  once again the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best  maybe im just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had but the fish just isnt all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster  we sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled  we had some hamachi and maguro nigiri neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls one of which was the negi toro roll that i had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had  wed actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the maguro nigiri and were ready to leave but as soon as we flagged down the waitress he presented the two pieces to us nearly a half an hour after the last roll hed served us when the place was less than half full  i find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place  that would seem to follow the logic of visiting europe and seeing a mcdonalds filled with americans and drawing the conclusion that mcdonalds is a topnotch american restaurant  the point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and i find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the valley  our last visit to hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh high quality sushi in scottsdale i would highly recommend trying yume at the scottsdale promenade"

   "  hmm i couldve sworn i had written a review of this place before  at the very least i uploaded a few pics of our breakfast here many months ago  took my mom to try the ovenbaked pancakes once  do yourself a favor and pass on these  guess the review and photos were taken down  lets see how long this new review sticks before its taken down too  cousin texted me yesterday and asked if id join her for breakfast at jp pancake today and i texted her back guessing that it was too late to warn her not to buy the groupon yes it was  i thought it would be a good opportunity to see if jp had improved on its service and food prep  as you can see it hasnt  we arrived around  am to see a deserted parking lot with the exception of one car parked in front of jpp  it looked like we were the only souls there besides our server and the cook in the kitchen  i thought perhaps well get better service this time since we were the only customers  the young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted handed us the menus and asked if wed like some coffee or juice to start with  i asked for coffee while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa  he said hed see if they had any in the back first  he came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa swiss miss and canned whip cream and said hed be back with my coffee  upon his return we placed orders of a golden brown waffle  two full orders of french toast one with strawberries one with bananas  per and two sides of bacon  pieces each  per  i later asked if the side of ham is offthebone and after consulting with the cook he came back with a yes  i placed a late order of that as well    while the service was good food arrived fast server checked back to see how we were doing the breakfast we had wasnt as good  our french toast slices httpwwwyelpcombizphotosjppancakescottsdaleselectqshavhzdrrgjoubxna qshavhzdrrgjoubxna were very dry the menu stated challah bread but i think it was more like cake and the slices couldve used a longer soak in the egg batter  out of the six halves on my cousins plate she only had one and all but one of her berry slices while i had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter  i wouldve suggested we share a plate but she didnt want to get bananas and i didnt want any berries  as ive said the only winner this morning was the waffle and i think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success  also i brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup since most restos offer up a nonorganic cane and corn syrup blend  my cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurants own syrup ditched that and then used mine until she was finished eating  their sides of bacon httpwwwyelpcombizphotosjppancakescottsdaleselectopmgcncpdwtxijjaijg opmgcncpdwtxijjaijg were very costly considering that these were very thin slices and very greasy even for bacon  i wouldnt hesitate paying  for a very nice plate of thicksliced bacon allnatural even but these were patheticlooking  as unfortunatelooking as they were however they did save breakfast for my cousins  as for the miniature slice of ham httpwwwyelpcombizphotosjppancakescottsdaleselectchisixyvwudemaxumca chisixyvwudemaxumca i was presented with i sent that back  i may have been a fool to agree to waste my calories on a horrible breakfast this morning thinking it was time to give jpp another chance for improvement but im not that big a fool to allow my cousin to be charged another  for a paltry serving  also zero props to our server who freaked my cousin out by hugging the wall by the kitchen with what i thought was the hope of keeping out of our vision while being able to hear our conversation without success  her sister confirmed seeing this behavior and thought it was very creepy too  i wished theyd alerted me sooner by asking me to switch seats so that i could see what they were talking about  overall what a lousy way to spend  and a breakfast meal out    original ticket was just under  which showed the order charges totaling under  before tax  if you account for scottsdales food tax of  what was the extra  or so for  a hidden tip  finding this hidden charge was surprising because our server did not know we were using a groupon  there was a sign on the door that stipulated that all groupon customers will be charged an  tip at checkout and my cousin did not mention her groupon until we were given the check  perhaps just perhaps jpp assumes that all of their customers are grouponusers  not farfetched since the yelp reviews cant be helping jpp these days"

   "ive lived at san antigua for about  years  my apartment is not updated which is fine with me because it saves me money and i work only a mile away so the commute is fantastic  they did put in all new appliances about a year and a half ago but i think they are the lowest quality possible the original microwave had a tag inside that it was manufactured in august  and it was not pretty  but it was clean and it worked better than my new one  same with the other appliances i would have been happy if they had replaced the washer with a efficient front loader  but the one i have doesnt even have a delicate cycle  i wash all of my work clothes in lingerie bags i have about  now to protect them from the beating they would get in that washer  i have had a few maintenance requests and they have usually come right away  i noticed comments about the water being off and the water was off often  once until late at night when the notice said during the day only and there was no way to get an update  it was very inconvenient and annoying but that is resolved  my main issue is with the office staff which is what is driving me to write today  the two main ladies ive interacted with in the last year i think one is gone now but her replacement is no better are not helpful at all  last year i was going to be away for  weeks and i asked about how i could handle my rent and my water bill payment i was to return on the th of the month  i could pay my rent ahead of time not ideal but thats fine but for the water bill i should pay more than the amount i paid for that month to make sure i covered next months because they charge you a late fee if you are one day late  i think they should have worked with me for the  water bill that would have been  days late  their attitude was too bad and they werent even nice about it  there used to be a drop box that i would drop my rent into on my way to work on the first but that is now gone you can pay your rent online now but the water bill doesnt show up on your account until sometime on the st usually after  am i can usually pay at lunch time and its there  today however i went to pay a little after noon and the water bill did not yet show up on my account  i called the office and was told they were having trouble with getting the water bill online i could bring a check in to the office  i pointed out they dont have a drop box anymore  she pretty much said i would be charged a late fee if i didnt pay today  so i hope i remember to go back online to pay that portion and i have to hope it is there to pay its like i get a    if im lucky hour window to pay the rent and i better make it work with my life  it is very frustrating and annoying  ive never had issues like this any where else i have lived  last year i probably would have rated them  stars but with my issues with the office staff i am down to   and im considering moving out when my lease is up in the fall"

   "ive been patronizing mimis for over  years and i am sad to report that they have finally reached their lowest point at least at this location  i have always been a big fan of mimis but this latest visit for a late breakfast on a sunday morning was the most disappointing visit ever  after almost a  minute wait we were finally seated even though the restaurant did not appear to be full  the young girls who were taking names and seating customers didnt seem to know what they were doing  despite giving us one of those ridiculous vibrating devices with flashing red lights they came outside at least twice looking for someone they could not find    the biggest disappointment was the cost of our breakfast dishes for what we received  we each ordered a mimosa with a low end sparkling wine which cost almost  each  my wife ordered their bacon apple waffles which were very good and tasty but there were only  tiny waffles about the diameter of a tennis ball    completely bare and accompanied by the tiny cup of syrup with chopped apples and bacon bits  i have a french variation of eggs benedict which was also pretty tasty but pricey for two small poached eggs on some seasoned mashed potatoes and spinach  our server was efficient but somewhat intense and not very personable  even the carpet in the dining area appeared dirty and unkempt  just not a great experience  probably wont return to any mimis for some time because they have definitely lost their edge and reputation as an upscale value chain restaurant  although i am a budding senior citizen my wife is not im beginning to feel out of place at mimis which is often populated by a sea of white hairs and snow birds who dont seem to mind their mediocre high priced fare set in a sort of disneyesque french atmosphere  it just doesnt resonate with me anymore and it doesnt feel at all upscale middle of the road like it used when they first opened restaurants in so cal where i used to live"

   "a few weeks ago i started a topic about laser eye surgery in the valley because i had no clue where to start i got a lot of feedback thanks yelpers it was all fantastic but i chose bob bs recommendation of jay schwartz in the end because of credibility seeing that he is the team ophthalmologist for the suns diamondbacks and coyotes  i was immediately sold i called for an appointment and was immediately scheduled and even mailed a packet of information with pricing and forms to fill out prior to my visit i was already being educated before walking in the door  the consultation for lasik eligibility was free and were not talking a quick innout sales technique i spent almost  hours being informed even further about the procedure and then going through a series of vision tests with not onenot twobut  experts  doctors  the final tests being performed by dr jay schwartz himself  i had many questions and each of them were answered clearly in depth and with genuine care i was never left alone for longer than a few minutes at which time i was comforted by the signed marion jersey on the wall i dont even watch sports but the entire office has jerseys from our lovely phoenix sports teams and ill admit it was pretty reassuring   i never felt pressured at any time during my visit either in fact it was quite the opposite and i had to ask to make an appointment to schedule the procedure so next week i will be going in for the surgery and ill be able to see its obvious dr schwartz is an expert and i couldnt feel more confident about my decision i will post a follow up review in a few weeks to share my experience"

   "we had the pleasure of working with bradys florals for our destination wedding at the sanctuary camelback resort and spa   during our initial conversation with lorraine i asked her to show me something i have never seen before and boy did she deliver she produced some of the most spectacular arrangements i have ever seen not only does she have impeccable taste but she was a joy to work with  in fact we trusted her so much that we ultimately gave her complete creative freedom for the event   the difference between a regular florist and a designer is that lorraine was able to bring our wedding space to life by creating elegant balanced designs combined with unique colors and textures   i was overwhelmed with guests praising how magnificent the flower arrangements were my cascading bouquet of queenannes lace ranunculus and orchids smelled incredible but my personal favorite was her chuppah design of smilax which accentuated the incredible garden view of the mountains  every detail was considered every petal was inspected  it was simply breathtaking thank you again to lorraine and the entire crew at bradys and the sanctuary who made our wedding simply unforgettable"

   "oki just walked back into my hotel room after a meal at this place i think im being overly generous by even giving them one star  fact of the matter is i had no choice but to give them one because there was nothing lower  i had the   combination which consisted of one cheese enchilada which was th of a percent decent one shredded beef hard shell taco which was perhaps the best thing on the plate and one bean tostada stale tostada  i also ordered an overpriced  chile relleno a la carte that tasted more like an effen omelette  cmon now the consistency of the egg covering the chile relleno should be fluffy and quickly fried  this thing looked like and tasted as if they first made an omelette and then wrapped it around a steamed chilethe chile wasnt even fire roasted   friends i know real mexican foodfine mexican food for that matter and this place is not it  with all due respect to those of you who have written rave reviews about this place and of course to the proprietors but i think i would have had a much better meal at the nearest taco bell gladly paying the  bucks i laid down for a less than mediocre meal  my recommendation to you all is dont bother  they should really consider dropping the fine from the name of this establishment  on a good note  the lady tending bar that evening was very very nice and attentive unfortunately the service alone cant hold this place up"

   "absolute great place to learn or just squeeze in a quick hole round clubhouse serves a great lunchdinner live music at nights later in the week and icecold hopshock always on tap service of the pro shop and the restaurant is pretty good  the best part about shalimar are the lessons from tyler and paul i was a terrible golfer when i started earlier this year my swing is starting to get there with their help and i couldnt be happier buckets are reasonable priced to work on your swing and a hole round with cart is pretty cheap especially now  footgolf is a great idea and fun to play it can be challenging at times for actual golfers to play around the big groups but if you check their schedule on when the footgolfers are allowed they are easily avoided heck buy a pack from the clubhouse and play a round of footgolf for yourself and see why the popularity is growing  allinall i love going to shalimar i have made it my home course while i am learning to play the game and i would recommend it to others"

   "i found this dentist office through yelp and the awesome reviews were spot on  dr amy and kristen were great   dr amy was so attentive and didnt try to sell me on anything like other dentists in the past have she has a genuine interest in your smile health and helping you save money most new patient appointments are simply the xrays poking and prodding but they did all of the exam plus the cleaning all at the same appointment to me this was awesome and made the most sense instead of just scheduling to come back yet again just for the cleaning which is what most other dentists have done in the past in my experience   in addition i was able to watch friends while getting my cleaning done with headphones on so i could zone out and not try to not make eye contacthave an awkward drooly conversation while they are in your mouth side note  why is it that dentists want to ask you questions when they are all in your mouth ha   that really helped take the ease off and made it a much more pleasant experience friends makes everything better after all"

   "in addition to the name which i love by the way i really liked this place  i went here with some coworkers after work for a couple of beers  there were five of us we each got an appetizer and each had two or more beers apiece and our tab was   not too bad for a couple hours of drinking on the patio  they have a pretty decent selection of food and we all seemed to enjoy our fare nothing special just your typical bar food and they offer mini pitchers of beer i love that  my only complaint is that they allow smoking on their patio  its just gross  but the patio is big enough that we just moved upwind from the smokers and we were fine    this would be a great spot to go watch a couple of games on the patio in the gorgeous weather and have a few drinks  ill be back again"

   "i went here for a friends birthday and must say that it will be the last time i ever go to pranksters maybe im new to the bar scene but having servers with attitudes and being bitchy to customers isnt my idea of a good time my friend ordered a water another friend ordered an iced tea and i ordered a cider it was hot outside so it would be a nice break right well  minutes later there is no sight of our waitress and no drinks she finally comes out with an iced tea and walks away but not before we flag her down turns out she forgot our orders even though she had the receipts she did apologize but it still took her  more minutes to bring a water and  minutes to bring a cider  another friend was trying to order and she completely ignored him she didnt show up until closing time  hour later to give us checks and shoo us all out i went to use the bathroom on the way out and had a waitress look me straight in the eye and say ugh thats why we have a closing time im sure there are nicer waitresses working there and maybe they were just having a bad night but that was more than i wanted to deal with and the worst service ive ever gotten anywhere period i wont be going back"

   "really great little breakfastlunch place tucked into one of the most industrial parts of tempe  you might not even know it was there were it not for a few covered tables on a make shift patio  really great food super prices and almost disgustingly nice people who work there    the place is so cute  black and white checkered tiles  white bead board up to a chair rail  very homey without being overly kitschy    while they do all the basics and do them well this isnt just your basic fare  how about their muffelatta for   or their hot sweet italian sandwich  with sausage onion peppers and mushrooms w melted provolone cheese   and their spinach salad with egg and bacon for   all good  they even have a monte cristo  on their menu and their basics are great  i had the tuna melt  on an employees recommendation and its one of the best ones ive had in a long time  i havent had their breakfasts yet but ive got my eye on their egg chorizo and roasted green chile wrap for     and then there are their drinks  sure  when i saw i could get hires root beer or squirt with my lunch i was stoked  but then i saw their coffee menu  how about a large oz iced coffee for  or a large iced chai for   they also cappuccino espresso and lattes for similarly great prices    but in the end its the folks who work there that have knocked me out my first time there the girl who took my order remembered my name and checked on me twice at my table  by name  she wasnt a waitress just worked behind the counter  but when she came to clear a table she just wanted to check on things    i almost hate to give the place up but the more folks who come by the more likely i am to be able to keep this place around  so i definitely encourage you to come by  even if its to just grab a coffee and a baked good  yes  they bake things fresh on site every day  just one more layer of their oh so goodness  if only they were open on saturday  hours mf ampm"

   "in a wordgrody  the second i walked in the door i was lambasted by a serious stank it smelled like sewage and industrial cleaners i should have done an about face at this time but i foolishly pressed on  i ordered the red devil white calzone which was advertised as mozzarella olive oil fresh roma tomatoes and garlic the mozzarella was over abundant and flavorless the tomatoes were mealy underripe and were decidedly not romas likely beefsteak or mountain pride the garlic was nearly raw and jammed into the calzone by the fistfull   im not a restaurateur but in my estimation the two most oft repeated sins of italian restaurants is to not make their mozzarella in house and to overload every dish with garlic mozzarella is easy and inexpensive to make and i love garlic but there is definitely such a thing as too much  i will not be returning to this location however it should be noted that i ate at the pinetop location last year and both the food and the ambiance were excellent"
