1,gi samurai sees sonny chiba guys get transported back civil war stricken feudal japan particular reason much carnage ensues it s rather top essay sword vs machine gun ultimately yields interesting results the plot essentially runs along rails might expect title initial fish out the water antics what flying metal box etc etc are not better here discussions ultimately huge battle latter proof film does not take seriously all carnage taking second half samurai army battles chiba s platoon face one would fully expect title still manages overwhelm inventiveness extravagance it s certainly one unique battle sequences time does not drag despite extended length chiba gives gruff performance iba initially good leader someone finally finds questioning morals situation slowly effect him certainly one better vehicles terrific cv final act two worlds effect wonder bit nihilism part writers seem asking were not better back then maybe reading bit much generally described hugely entertaining two hours almost non stop action
