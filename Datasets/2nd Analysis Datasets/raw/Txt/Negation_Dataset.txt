Review_new
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why
the nurse couldnt even bandage my wound
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me
this phone cant be any more innovative
my friend did not like his bloody mary
never going back
 they never brought a salad we asked for
this doctor cant even diagnose a flu
would not recommend to others
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place
not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious
nobody should have to waste time on this game
i am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore
i cannot believe that they arent sold out every day
angelina jolie couldnt save this tragedy of a movie
the new samsung galaxy is not worth it
sauce was tasteless
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed
i havent even read 5 pages and had to stop this boring book
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever
it was not good
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying
i would not recommend this book to anyone
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible
i probably wont be back to be honest
stay away nothing good comes out this place
i dont suggest going here for food ever maybe for the drink specials and hookah but nothing else
never had any experience with rudeness here or any other problem
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving
i was very disappointed
not good by any stretch of the imagination
this place deserves no stars
i got the gold standard a  burger and was kind of disappointed
this software is not user friendly
id rather not eat here any time soon
the banker recommended me to not buy this stock and saved me a ton of money
i could not be happier
the selection of food was not the best
the food wasnt too cold or too warm which left me satisfied
the squiggler fell apart at second use with no way to put the prongs back into the base
this cup cant be any better
im not impressed with the concept or the food
this place is disgusting
restaurant is always full but never a wait
slightly overpriced but not unreasonable for the quality and atmosphere
soggy and not good
never again will i be dining at this place
the service was not up to par either
i couldnt put this down and laughed smiled and even got tears
the cleaning service cant be any more meticulous and clean
real sushi lovers lets be honest  yama is not that good
my friend didnt lie when he told me i would love this place
this shirt cant be any better
i wouldnt enter this restaurant even if someone pays me for it
talking to the policeman didnt really help me
i will not return
the food is not tasty at all
they do not keep to a high standard of service
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak
chris hemsworth cant be any more charming than in this movie
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed
contrary to other review i found my cell phone holder to be of very good quality and have used it for a long time now with no problems whatsoever
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal
this is not well manufactured
the servers are not pleasant to deal with
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it
the warm beer didnt help
it was just not a fun experience
there is nothing authentic about this place
we took our friend visiting here for some soul food and merts did not disappoint
the intern cant even print copies
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh
i cant wait to go back
i wish i had not found this place at all
this bar didnt disappoint me
so dont go there if you are looking for good food
get the pasta trio you wont regret it
the burger had absolutely no flavor
i cant believe that i paid for such a low quality product
you cant go wrong with any of the food here
did not like at all
unfortunately it was not good
i wouldnt trade my apple watch for anything else in this world
definitely not worth the  i paid
this is usually not my taste but surprisingly i did like it
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed
the company unprofessional period
dont go here
i cant believe i bought this way overpriced radio
i had great expectations that were sadly not met for the price of the room
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone
i would not recommend this place
my steak wasnt rare but cold
i only had pho so i cant judge the rest of the food but the pho was the worst ive ever had
the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems
i will not be eating there again
no complaints whatsoever
i wouldnt recommend this ralph lauren shoes to anyone
would not go back
drivers accept never show
you cant beat that
this is an unbelievable bargain
you cant go wrong with this microphone
the restaurant isnt bad like others try to make it out to be
the banker couldnt even tell me why my account has been frozen
the rooms are not worth the money
why this place is so popular i will never understand
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor
this place is not quality sushi
this movie should not be nominated for an oscar
i cant believe i had to pay for this
this is not what i paid for
the service is quick and its not very pricey
the stewardess was unattentive
service was slow and not attentive
i couldnt express how thankful i was for the policemans help
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop
this trump doesnt sound as good as it should
this place never fails
donald trump doesnt seem to be that truthful
the steward was unattentive
as for the mains also uninspired
the german banker had an inconvenient way of explaining
i cant believe how pleasant the cashier was
this apple product is a good for nothing
christians are not to be trusted
im disappointed with the porsche model
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless
i didnt really like the book
bradley cooper cant even act
the real disappointment was our waiter
nothing can trump this beautiful table
uninformative european tour guide
i cant live without my new apple watch
there were six employees behind the counter and one customer waiting for their sandwich to be made and i was the only person in line and couldnt get a single person to take my order
