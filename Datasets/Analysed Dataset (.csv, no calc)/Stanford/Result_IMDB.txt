disappointing film the story established protagonist chrissy young rather sullen individual drifting much actually little move narrative along did not surprise see focus shifting relatives it s pity though chrissy seem like interesting character story predictable times felt quite formulated question is going see campions jacksons tamahori s breaking ground compelling cinematically told stories inspire rather entertain toll two hours technically disgusting shot film.
