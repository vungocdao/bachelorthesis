ive never been to new orleans so i dont know if that makes me somehow less qualified to review this place  but i suspect a fair amount of people have never been to china and it doesnt stop them from reviewing pf changs  anyway the thing about noto whenever i have eaten there is that i am always expecting it to be way greater than it really is because of the way people talk about it  i am always expecting this transcendent experience but really all i get is a styrofoam container of some spicy slop that really has no real flavor underneath the initial tongue shock of cayenne pepper.
  Negative
overall felt like the food lacked flavor the jambalaya and gumbo seemed blah to both of us the bbq shrimp and cornbread were both good.

this west location is now closed   owner would like to reopen in the future.

opinions are a changing  went to pedros over the weekend  tamales were not good  the sauce had formed a skin on the top because it sat under the heat lamps too long  i took three bites before i found any pork  i ate half of one and the waiter asked if i wanted to take the rest home  when i said no my satisfaction was not questioned  ill stick with laredos.
  Negative
danger will robinson avoid this place stale chips pace picante salsa microwaved food i ordered a chimi and the middle was still frozen server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu the dining area is extremely shabby ripped cushions and dingy tables i do not know why i stayed after the first five minutes.

i am reviewing specifically the chicago hot dog cart in this home depot i love it  who in their right mind does not want to go to a store on a saturday afternoon shop and then have one of the best hot dogs in madison   im just saying for  i can have a chicago style hot dog loaded with all the fixins including a kosher pickle its great  my wife gets the chili dog and swears by it she also has said on multiple occasions at the home depot that the chili dog is one of the best in the area   who would guess that a small little hot dog stand sitting in the home depot was so awesome   im telling you instead of running out to your car to drive back home and think about doing your weekend warrior projects take a minute and snag a hot dog at the cart located inside the entrance of home depot  vienna dogs true chicago dog style great hot dog.
  Negative
another chain sit down by the mall  but not at the top of my list the food hasnt seemed to change since ive gone here except for less options  waiting for a table is common unless you go at really off peak times recently got a burger there asked for well done  and burger arrived bloody and red  waiter took it back and about  minutes brought the same burger back and was still pink on the inside  was offered something else  but the others i was with were already done  did get a coupon for a return visit good deal with the  for  and an app if your food is cooked right.

the bridges has become my default golf course for meeting up with friends and getting in   it is a cityowned course on the northeast side of madison south of the airport  most of the course is situated amidst lowlying wetlands while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along anderson avenue  it is an fairly easy course to walk except that the proximity to water does mean a good amount of mosquitoes  the recent rains led to a lot of flooding on the course but i played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition  i especially like the bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you but there always seems to be a bit of both  other courses are either too hard or too easy mostly too hard but the bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible  its enough of a challenge to keep you coming back without demoralizing you and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the area   the major downside to the bridges is the proximity to the airport  most of the course is right on the flight path for landing jets and this is distracting at first  once youve played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts and dane county regional isnt exactly ohare  another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy  the vegetation in the ob areas is thick reedy wetland stuff so just go ahead and consider that ball lost  lastly the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow  however since i prefer to walk this usually works in my favor  for some these drawbacks are a dealbreaker but given the crowds on any given weekend i have to assume that this is a minority opinion  the price is very reasonable  from  to  walking  depending on the time  there is a twilight special where after  pm you can golf as much as you would like for   the only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow  the bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the cityowned courses  the bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps  the last time i was there i enjoyed the new capital prairie gold from a frosty mug  you can always count on getting a can of capital out on the course as well  the menu is surprisingly broad and wellmade  the wraps are a satisfying end to the round as are the sandwiches and the appetizers  you can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating  several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too  i think that top to bottom the bridges has about the best layout of the cityowned courses and is my personal favorite.

i came through this dive while pubcrawling amongst friends as we lined up at the bar to order beers and grub  the bartenders muttering under her breath oh shit should have tipped us off to the piss poor service that awaited us apparently theyre not accustomed to seeing a group of  people waltz in this dump go fig mind you we were very accommodating and considerate of the surprise rush we created however when they served our table separately and completely forgot my food i was forced to demand a refund theyre lucky i wasnt a complete ahole and demanded the portion of the tip that i already paid toward my food order  sure if youre looking for a very lonely dive all to yourself and a few friends this might be your place but for us it was a complete and utter disaster  oh did i mention the incessant flies throughout the establishment yeah not cool.
  Negative
i dont live quiiiiite close enough for this to be my neighborhood bar but it meets all the requirements laidback atmosphere great food and seriouslygreatcraftbeerlist their beers are all of the cantpickupatthegasstation variety and its worth coming by just for thatthe menu diversity is the cherry on top of my craft beer float.

used hotwire to find a last minute deal when traveling through madison we generally aim more for country inn or hampton but this was the best deal  at checkin i was told they only had king beds left  though the parking lot was quite empty  when we got to the room there were no sheets for the hideabed we went to the front desk and asked for some we were told that the security guard would bring them up  minutes later it was close to  am at this point we had to call and remind them   the room was pretty rough lots of ding marks on the doors and trims the light over the mirror didnt work things were just worn out  the bed had clearly seen better days  crowne gives you these silly relax packs with aroma therapy stuff  a good bed would do more for making me relaxed   in general i wasnt impressed  well stick with country inn  hampton inns.
  Negative
this place is huge and that is good because it can get packed pretty quickly on the weekends this is especially true when the weather outside forces us to look for indoor activities   unlike the previous poster i initially had a hard time figuring out the computer seated at the table i kept jamming my fat little fingers onto the screen expecting a touch screen response fortunately the other bowlers in my party realized that my genius was showing and helped me figure it out durrrrrr   the bowling was fun even though i probably should have had the bumpers on like the minors in our group did at least then i would have not looked liked the biggest dork in three counties just a weeny   we ordered deep fried cheese curds and deep fried macaroni for snacking no healthy eating here they were yummy and just as good as culvers but since ive said that now ill have to hide from rabid culvers fans yikes   well go here again and i can once again provide comic relief with my mad bowling skillz   werd.
  Negative
the food can be good here not great but good but the biggest problem for me is the awful service  somebody teach these people some customer service  i swear that the guy who waited on me the last time i was there was high  the interminable waiting for refills on drinks and the check drove my blood pressure through the roof  ive determined that the secret to getting good service from anyone here is to be a hot looking college girl  that seemed to keep the waiters attention focused on the table next to mine  maybe she was one of the more positive posters here.
  Very negative
yummy yummy yummy  has always been one of my favorite diners in madtown  delicious veggie chili spicy cornbread malts and desserts as well as the amazing array of other veggie options  just yesterday i tried the new spinoccoli quiche with fruit which was pretty darn goodcoffee is always hot and refills frequent  still have yet to try the famous zucchini pancakes but next time i must  i must also remember to save room for dessert  look forward to returning sooner than later to try some of the other new lunch options on the menu  only downer is the waitlack of parking on a busy day  overall two thumbs up from me monty.
  Positive
ive been to montys at least once for every meal the omelettes are to die for huge in quantity unique in ingredients highly recommend the spinach and feta the salads are the same thing definitely large and delicious last night i went for dinner and got the meatless loaf and now i want the recipe for the cashew gravy if my memory serves me correctly it was cashew to put on everything amazing shakes and malts complete the perfect comfortdiner food experience.

friendly staff and nice selection of vegetarian options  food is just okay not great  makes me wonder why everyone likes food fight so much.

if i could give this place  stars i would ive been coming here since opened and it is consistently the best breakfast all day more than just burgers and fries deserts beer selectioni cant rave enough  the meatloaf of the gods is to die for and their just coffee roast their own blend is so amazingly good i have my mom buy it and send it up to me in minneapolis its that good  some of the people that work there have been there since i was a kid its a neighborhood place where youre bound to run into people you know and i make a point to go there at least twice while im home to visit  yay montys.
  Negative
if you have poached eggs on your menu and do not know how to poach an egg do not offer it as an option i got the breakfast item with spinach mornay sauce and poached eggs only to receive hard boiled eggs it completely ruined the dish and my want to ever come back not to mention that the food is always mediocre not happy and not coming back.
  Very negative
one of my favorite places to eat   zucchini pancakes are awesome  we mostly eat breakfast here but im sure lunch and dinner are just as good.
  Negative
looking for a big hearty breakfast then look no further because this place has got exactly what youre looking for and for a pretty reasonable price i went here with my friend after a night of ahem good old madison weekend fun and this was exactly what we needed i got the eggs mornay which has this sausage patty and poached eggs with this very nice sauce on top of an english muffin and if that wasnt enough carbs for you it comes with a generous helping of fried potatoes good stuff  also a random note despite its appearance as an old fashioned diner i got a very hipstery vibe from it once i got in.
  Positive
tried this place based upon the yelp reviews my girlfriend  i had hamburgers i also had a salad with the best  island dressing ive ever had  my girlfriend did not want onions and her burger came out with them they quickly brought her a new one we finished up with a huge turtle sundae we shared caution this sundae is not for only one person  our service was satisfactory and we arrived before the dinner rush pm so seating was easy at pm the place had a significant queue but it was a saturday night and the barrymore had an event   overall the fare the cost and the atmosphere make this a must try.

food is consistently good we often go for weekend brunch im from nj which has a lot of  hour diners this is one of the only places in madison that offers breakfast all day so its great in my book dont come if you mind long lines or kid.

very busy and the for the floor show i watched a small child dash back and forth from the dining area into the kitchen area and back again multiple times i didnt like the floor show so that was the last time i went there.
  Negative
i have only been here a few times service is pretty good but my big problem is the shakes first time i got a shake it was really thick and almost worth the  bucks i looked forward to having another some day last friday i went there for another shake and it was really thin like chocolate milk maybe when teenagers are making milk shakes for minimum wage you get varied results  is way too much for a watery shake get it together people.

everyone already knows how awesome montys blue plate diner is so i dont have to tell you that your carnivore and herbivore friends will love the menu they source local ingredients cook real food and even bring in local products such as yumbutter and create extra superduper healthy menu items by partnering with jon hinds at monkey bar gym  however i write this review because i recently ate the most amazing curry dish there ive been craving it ever since and cannot wait to return im serious it was a hot steaming bowl of freshly steamed vegetables with rice and a fantastic curry sauce i want to eat this every day our server even told me that she actually does eat this every day and has since they put it on their menu it was a huge bowl so i took half of it home with me so i could enjoy a second meal of leftovers   now drop everything and order this curry  and order a piece of pie or enjoy an iced sugar cookie too.

i really dislike menards  for every positive interaction i have i have two negatives ones  my husband and i just bought a house so you can imagine how much time we spend here  i prefer home depot but the prices are so much lower at menards  in the matter of two weeks all of this happened   i bought a can of paint for our guest room  i wanted the best paint with the primer all the bells and whistles  i was covering purple  i needed it  the salesperson said i could pick from any four  yet he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other  it was weird  like here are your options but i can not tell you what their difference really is  and some were the same brand   when painting the ceiling of said room we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it  this paint was about six months old  nothing happened to it  so we go back to menards  we have shopped at several area menards because we are about convenience  the lady at the counter was so rude  we did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system  we pay for most things in cash and apparently this is not a good idea at menards  it had a menards sticker which this location does not use but other locations still use    every time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here  we then had to repeat again that we do not just shop at this location  we shop outside the city sometimes  we pick things up on our way home    another rep interceded and offered to return it for us  she was so nice  i wish i remembered all of their names  but she needed a person from paint to approve it  before looking at the paint a rep spoke to this rude customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back  it must be our fault and that is that  then they said they could not take and dispose of it  nice huh  no one asked us anything  the paint was brand new     the same day we went to return the paint we wanted to look at screen doors  there was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone  he was so short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions  it was ridiculous    so the prices keep us going back but the rest  awfulhellish.

so good we went as a group and everyone loved the food they ordered  the food was very reasonably priced yum.

maybe the most disorganized store i have ever seen now add that in with trying to bring my dog with me into this storepure chaos   my last visit of many ive made to this petsmart made me realize that im better off heading to either fleet farm or tabby and jacks to get whatever i may be looking at locally for my dog    i enjoy the fact i can walk my dog into the store to get what i need but when i head to the footwear isle to find nothing for medium to large dog sizes i get a little irritated  do the employees working here know how to stock the shelves why are all the socks and footwear thrown all over the bottom shelf of the clothing isle   not everyone has a  lb dog im not even asking much i have a  lb english bulldog and i still could not find anything in his size   the last thing i want to do is sift through items thrown all over the floor and shelf forget it   i asked a employee if they carried socks for medium to large size dogs  their website says this store does have these items in stock and instead of even helping me sift through their ridiculous isle i was told what you see if what we have  come on man really is this your best customer service  not sure if you will be seeing much more of me and my bully anytime soon coming back in here.

lots of fun little bit of cash   these games are great for getting a bit of fresh air hanging with a few friends drinking afew brews and munching on some ballpark goodies very family friendly but still fun for those of us who dont know who the hell the jonas brothers are   i personally have never been in the duck blind but i hear its overrated  bring sunscreen if youre on the thirdbase line.

i have a new found love for indian food and when i found myself in madison i had to check this place out it was most excellently delicious the staff was very nice and the price for  people including  drinks and an appetizer was about  if you ever find yourself on the east side of madison you should really check this place out.
  Positive
heres the lowdown  theyre like every other shop that makes you take it in the chili ring they only did the bare minimum amount of work possible to align my vehicle i know a lot about alignment i would have done it myself if i had access to the equipment they only adjusted the toein and reported back that the bolt which actuates the upper control arm eccentric was frozen so they couldnt make the adjustment to the caster angle   i then informed jr pinhead that i have a benzomatic torch and can heat the bolt to loosen it which he replied that his tech had use a torch on all the bolts funny thing is in the report from the equipment all the angles were within spec that would have required heat to loosen the adjustment hardware with the exception of the frozen one  i used to work at a firestone and i thought that lazy shit was just at my location i was expecting this type of work from a local shop with a couple of random dopers not firestone.

famous daves is so much better i use to go here all the time when i was growing up and i loved it i dont know what happened but there food really went down the drain the ribs are dry and black on the bottom and the fries have way too much seasoning i think jon needs to get back in the kitchen instead of spending all his time at the bar next door.

a few of us hit smoky jons for lunch today  it was insisted that its the best bbq in madison so i was game to try it  the place has character  you order at a window and go take a seat  they bring the food out to you  nothing fancy  paper plates styrofoam cups etc  i got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries  i snarfed a fry to start  not very hot warm id say but tasty  salty  could have been better if fresh but theyll do  the coleslaw was the creamiest ive ever had  the flavor wasnt strong but it was okay  could have used a little salt and pepper  neither to be found  the pork was tasty  definitely smokey  the side of sauce made it however  sweet tangy spicy  while i was eating it i thought yeah its okay  but i wouldnt rave about it  later however thinking back on the meal i thought you know that was really good  while it doesnt best the bbq ive had in memphis it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth id have it again  i think my meal was around  no drink  had a water  i was full and content  mission accomplished  my coworker had some ribs and they looked very good  not too fatty cooked well  i would like to go back and try them sometime  tip  limited seating so show up early or late.

having returned from a bbq binge in kansas city a few months ago we decided wed get ribs in celebration of the royals making the playoffs then winning the pennant and then again for game  of the world series so weve had smoky jons ribs and pork shoulder three times in three weeks  heres whats excellent the pork shoulder and the sauce are fantastic right up there with the best there is just yummy  heres whats not extremely inconsistent ribs i completely agree with another reviewer regarding the membrane it really ought to be removed every timenot doing so is laziness by the pitmaster  for us batch   was pretty good  not kc level but totally fine batch   really was kc level just excellenttender juicy ribs clean bones very nice food heaven batch   was terrible  dry meat thick membrane difficult to even cut into rib chunks theres no way what we received could have ever won an award from anyone  so after spending about  here in the last three weeks i cant recommend it hey ribs aint cheap and thats fine but its hard to justify if the quality isnt even close i realize there will always be slight variationsthats what makes bbq great but the incredible inconsistency here kills it for me.

my previous review was for an oil change which i still stand by  this time i brought in my car because it was making a rattling noise  i was told that the bracket holding my flex tube was broken and it would be around  to replace the whole pipe  the pipe itself was not damaged and i asked if there was a cheaper option to attach the pipe back to the car either by welding it or creating a new bracket the mechanic gave me a rude answer about coat hangers    i called around and was quoted  to replace the pipe at speedys muffler when i brought it in there to get it replaced they told me the pipe itself could just be bracketed to the car for    make sure you call around before getting work done here in case there are other repair options that chets didnt consider.

i usually take my car to the honda center for maintenance but thought i would try a locally owned shop and found the chets car care  had excellent reviews the staff was very friendly and the service was excellent i will definately stay with the chets car care for all of my cars needs.

i hate giving star reviews but im not sure how else to rate the overall experience  the atlas court location appears to be quite aged extremely cramped and lacks quality customer service they do have a ton of equipment available but thats about it  i arrived on saturday morning with my reservation for a  truck firmly inhand there was a line of people waiting to checkincheckout equipment and only one person working behind the counter   the employee a younger gentleman appeared to be struggling with everything he did and he wasnt shy about hiding his frustrations after waiting for around  minutes another employee i believe hes the manager jumpedin and helped folks the manager was much more proficient helpful and friendly i was third or fourth in line and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer  when i went to get my truck there was an equipment problem so they substituted another truck for me unfortunately the truck that i was provided was ancient  it had  miles on it the check engine light was on and it ran so poorly that i thought i was going to breakdown at several points along the way the steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire tim.

for all the hype michaels is quite a disappointment   maybe its because i didnt try the custard but seriously i didnt need more weighing down in this weatherso i ordered an orange crush float instead for something that would have cost me maybe cents to make at home i paid close to  for a oz cup that is ridiculous in general i think their prices are pretty steep for what you getyoud probably have to order a burger to really get a bang for your buck  like rb i also had an issue with the service it was slow disorganized and not very friendly the line was almost out the door but the employees behind the counter didnt even attempt to speed up the service one of them just disappeared into a back room tsktsk i also thought it was hilarious how one of the employees crumpled up an order form before the order had been completed and then had to uncrumple the paper so she could reread the order to her coworker really   anyway i will probably give the monroe st michaels  and their custardsburgers  a shot but im not going to get my hopes up.
  Negative
dont go to this store  the service is always poor the people working there are unfriendly dont know what they are selling where anything is located and to top it off you are likely to be overcharged  so if you do go you best check your receipt  plus they tend to get in your face when questioned about store policy  sure they have the food i want but i can get it in a different friendly store  lose the attitude  what ever happened to good quality customer service.
  Negative
for tax levys late paperwork and apologies after the fact come to sorge  we had every penny in our accounts levied by the state because sorge didnt do what they agreed to do in a timely manner  in fact they never did it at all just forgot about it  wife is  months pregnant and all of our money thousands we saved for the baby coming is gone.

i drove by this place many timeslooking at the allyoucaneat tue and thur meals  well i finally took the bait  as i entered the place i was surprised with amount of items on the wallsi thought it was in good taste but i am sure others will find it tacky  the food was above average but not the best i have ever had  the chicken was smokey and moistthe ribs were good but a few on the dry side  waitstaff very nice and attentive  great nightill be back.

barely ok service was flat out terrible its always bad when your server throws another server under the bus for taking  minutes to get service after sitting downnot impressed service throughout the meal was extremely slow and it took  minutes to just get our food for  people   the food is ok not even close to the best in madison the ribs were very dry and tough the flavor of the rub was good however the bbq sauce on the table was also very good   will not be going back.

yes i am reviewing a starbucks  the reason for this review was for the exceptional service i received here this past weekend  my wife has been saving the points up on her starbucks rewards card a gold card it turns out that you have to cash in free drinks within  days on your card now and they can not be stored and used when ever you like so instead of have multiple free drinks on her card for us to use we only had  free one the employee at the counter explained this new rule to us and still hooked us up with a second free drink any size any kind of our choice  it was truly awesome customer service so thank you lady employee behind the register this last easter sunday around noon  other things i noticed about this starbucks it was very clean a well organized pastrymuffin area there is no drive thru so that kinda sucks i counted at least  people working behind the counter so staffed properly our drinks were made quick and tasted great   out of  only because it is a starbucks and there are just so many of them its not original  again excellent customer service.

we recently bought a midcentury house and had no furniture for a couple of the rooms we went to the rubins clearance center and happened to catch their moving sale which meant that everything was marked down below their normal clearance price nice you wont pay ikea prices but this is for the most part highquality stuff real leather real wood for most items etc there are a few with scratches and dents and many items are floor models but for the most part that doesnt bother me we got a really good deal on a chair that apparently someone had ordered but came with the wrong fabric we also left with a shelfstorage unitdrawer thing a desk and a rolling chair the manager threw in a few gifty items i had picked out too   the downside is the salesperson not the manager kept reminding us that it was  minutes until closing time this started a half hour before believe me i used to work in retail and i know the oh you have a half hour before we close trick we were out of there ten minutes before they closed so its not like we were making them stay late if youre making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars it ended up under k but still you shouldnt be pushing people out the door i might have picked up a couple of other items if i hadnt felt rushed out.

the worst arbys i have ever eaten at if you want a good one visit the one on park  so here is why it is bad  the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered four different sandwiches this is compared to other arbys ive eaten at  they say they dont have any monthly deals i was told they belong to the same owner as the one on park and they have monthly deals  tried it twice and both times they messed up our order we paid but did not get things  their customer service is awful i dont expect much in life but when i go somewhere to give them my money  i expect better than what i got here.

i have been to the ultimate several times for massages with ellen and would highly recommend her  she is very personable friendly and professional  i feel extremely relaxed after our sessions  i also used ellen for a prenatal massage when pregnant being as big and uncomfortable as i was i was worried if i would be able to relax fully  ellen has blankets and pillows just for that reason super comfortable and she remembers to ask about the baby after she was born highly recommend  the only reason i did not give  stars was that the hallway outside the room can get a bit loud if people are walking down talking or laughing they should maybe make that more of a quiet space with notices that people are in session  nothing ellen could help though.

horrible service inedible food tremendous swivel factor but my drink was fine  their advertised drink specials are good but most concentrated on shots and lowend liquors think smirnoff for  the service at the bar was hard to come by although there were at least two bartenders working  i asked for a minute with the menu and spent the next  minutes trying to flag down a bartender to take my food order  ordered the shrimp special which was not very special at all  although there were  grilled shrimp that were actually pretty good the rest of the plate was a mess of flavorless watery rice pilaf and a virtual stalk of broccoli steamed but otherwise unadorned  at  it was definitely not a good value  plus it took forever to arrive the gentleman next to me ordered the meatloaf special and his cafeteriastyle serving arrived in about  seconds  that didnt make me very happy for him however as it looked equally disgusting  i cannot recommed this place for anything other than a drink although the pool players seemed to be having a good time.

i have given this place multiple tries now and finally have decided to give it a proper review general tsos is my go to dish for chinese take out an this place failed miserably on that nothing but over cooked chicken with a lot of sauce and breading and yucky skin yuck the lo mien was also horrible there was just no flavor what so ever and nothing but noodles and what looked to be whatever mysterious vegetable they had lying around  if i wanted to order leftovers i would order leftovers  there saving grace is their hot sour soup very tasty but i had one bad experience with it where i ordered a large to go and instead of telling me they only had enough for a small container they put the left overbottom of the pot in and filled it up only  of the way talk about shady service i even watched them do it from behind the counter trying to pull a fast one on me i think not  im still giving it a solid  stars because their egg rolls and ragoon were at least tasty too other than the tasty soup that is when they have it available but in all honestly nothing special i can go to any chinese take out joint and get the same thing any day of the week   so yeahif you want good chinese this is not the place i recommend if you want quick chinese just because your craving itwell maybe rethink it or just settle for the china inn.

i had not taken my family to rr in quite some time  everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive friday night dinner  pulling in the parking lot i was surprised at the lack of business  that should have been my first clue  we were seated promptly and our drink order was taken  then we waited  and waited  finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken  we ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals  again we waited  our appetizer finally arrived  but no soup  it was mediocre and sadly the best food we would have that evening  our entrees arrived shortly after  it was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup  soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl  it almost looked as though it had been full at one point then dumped out  the fries were cold on all our meals  the burger i ordered well done was extremely pink i did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable  more than halfway through our entrees a gentlemen in what appeared to be a managers uniform came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours  my husband laughed and told him no i already got this half full bowl  a few moments later i bit into something hard like bone in my burger  at that point i was disgusted  and done  i would have told the waitress that the food and service was awful but we were never asked  when she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a  bowl  so my husbands comment must have at least made it back to her yet there was no apology for it nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entruee   for  people lacklusterslow service and terrible food  no thanks rr  we wont be back.

this review is solely for the flavor waffle cone  boring  it has a vanilla custard base with waffle cones and chocolate pieces in it  first there was not many piece of chocolate or waffle cone in it  it was not a fun and interesting mix of addins    i like their vanilla ice cream this flavor did nothing for it.

i love culvers as a company first  they are solid through and through    each location varies a little but i think on the whole the parent company does enough to keep the franchises in line very well  ive never been disappointed with any culvers at which ive eaten  this location does everything well  i work near here so i go here at least once a week for lunch and have for probably the last four years  i have never had a single complaint  even when theyre busy they manage to keep the place looking well and getting the food out fast and hot  the only knock i could issue against this place is the layout of their parking lot isnt great  it could get fixed  if you park on the righthand side of the lot you can get stuck in your space if theres a long line at the drivethru.

note  i only just got my car back so i cannot yet comment on the longterm resilience of the paint job  my wife bought a new vw passat in december and was hit by a dump truck in january there was body damage to the driverside front door back door and rear quarter panel our insurance is with geico who has an agent that works right out of abras office so i took it there for an assessment  everyone was extremely kind and helpful the process of getting the estimate both by geico and by abra was very quick and easy also abra was nice enough to provide me with a rental car on their dime enterprise came out to abras location and we took care of the rental there  all i paid for was the insurance which was like day  abra sent daily updates via text message letting me know their progress and as soon as they had an estimated completion time the let me know that as well  i dropped it off on tuesday january  and they completed all the repairs and paint on friday however i couldnt pick it up until monday january  as the paint needed to dry  the car looks excellent.

the staff at urbana tire company have always been very friendly knowledgeable and incredibly helpful  they always provide real timely service at an affordable price and they dont give you the runaround with repair costs or deadlines  they are located close enough to downtown urbana that if you drop off your car you can take a peaceful stroll down main street maybe stop by the book store or drop into any one of the diningdrinking establishments to have a cool beverage and a tasty bite to eat while your car gets fixed.

we have been going to caring hands with our dogs and cats for many years  dr curt saw us through the aging and passing of two cats and a dog all well into old age with great quality of life    dr curt also saw us through the adoption of a new dog who has a specialized problem an urge to eat every inedible object and substance he encounters  at  months old our new puppy developed a serious bowel obstruction and required removal of  feet of his intestines and reattachment  this was a complicated and risky surgery  because of curts supreme surgical skill that dog is with us today at  years old happy and loved  dr rebecca is also an outstanding vet both in terms of skill and caring feeling for animals and their human families  we have now seen dr rebecca many times for the regular care of the dog who lived and the newest addition to our family another rescue dog who came to us with a number of minor healthcare problems  we trust dr rebecca implicitly  the staff at caring hands are also amazing  good with people competent at the animal health care business loving to animals and able to calm and handle them  the staff has low turnover and some of them like gigi have been there as long as we have    you could not choose a better vet service in the champaignurbana and surrounding areas  if you are at some distance in an outlying small town as we are they are well worth the drive.

brought my saturn to fairfield automotive and i couldnt be happier the fuel pump had a component that was cracked and they were able to repair it rather than my purchasing the entire unit which saved me the equivalent of my mortgage this month  i will definitely return and would recommend their service very personable and friendly staff and an overall great experience.

i went here today because my car needed an oil change badly id been putting it off because i just moved here in august am i allowed to say just still and wasnt sure how to go about finding a reliable place i chose meineke from the five or so car places i had coupons for by looking at the reviews on yelp for  or a little over  including tax with my coupon basic oil change is usually  i had my oilfilter changed and the oil disposed of properly fluids topped off and a basic beltstires overall inspection the men there were so friendly and speedy they didnt give me the runaround just my oil changed with a smile i would recommend them to anybody and will be back  also from drive up to drive away it took maybe  minutes even though there were several other cars in the garage i went at pm on a tuesday afternoon.

ok this place has decent food  well depending on the day  sometimes its good sometimes its not  however for a small mom and pop place they dont seem to do much to make people feel welcome    the last time i ate there was the last time  i had breakfast with a friend of mine and all was going well weak coffee aside  we ordered some breakfast and the waitress who turned out to be one of the managers or supervisors asked if we wanted gravy on our potatoes  my friend said id love it on the side please only to be told no  when he said no she replied gravy is complimentary and you either have it on the potatoes or no gravy  i made the choice then that if one bowl for gravy was too precious to wash then i would save them the time and effort by not going back  problem solved all dishes are clean  skip it and go to sams cafe.

pizza in the cu seems to be an overall disappointment we like papa dels but it is pricey and takes forever to deliver and although we like jupiters and timpones for a good thin crust they are more involved than a simple good delivery or quick bite  stepping into that gap my wife and i find papa murhpys convenient and tasty their veggie delite is great what i like about the pizza is that the toppings are good particularly the ample fresh veggies   one of their pizzas has a garlic sauce that we also like  maybe its just me but these pizzas seem much less oily and overall slightly healthier than what we get when we order out and of course in baking ourselves get second to none freshness  so weve had great experiences here and really enjoyed the flavors and also feel that weve ate slightly healthier and saved some money it also doesnt hurt that were a mile away and we can grab one on a trip to schnucks.

id give it a zero if i could this place is weak as fuck mexican food please id rather go to taco bell theres a taco truck down the road that youre better off spending your money on.

ive  reviewed another cracker barrel in the past and this location lives up to the allamerican constant that ive come to expect from cracker barrels its a tradition for my sister and i to have a meal at cracker barrel when i come to visit her so we headed straight over there when i got off the train yesterday morning i was pleasantly surprised to be seated without a wait it was about  in the morning and the parking lot was packed postchurch crowd  but we must have come in at the perfect time because there was one empty clean table and it was ours our server was very nice our food came out quickly and tasted great you know how sometimes when food comes out really fast it tastes old like they made it earlier and waited for someone to order it this wasnt the case it was all piping hot and fresh the odds were ever in our favor.

for my th review i thought about writing about beaches in san diego art centers in los angeles cafes in new mexico or bookstores in boston  but it seemed right to focus on the mass transit district of champaignurbana the bus system that keeps my life in order    i moved a month ago to chambana and it has quickly become apparent that i do not live in southern california any more  the land is flat the wind comes sweeping through the place is smaller in scope and im rapidly realizing that im not going to want to rely on my car when the snow falls from the sky  enter champaignurbana mass transit district  theres no need for a parking permit when there are countless continuously running lines covering the entire area  my weekday mornings find me checking my house looking through my backpack making sure all my stuff is in order before frantically hustling down the street in order to catch the  silver south line to campus which runs twice an hour    if im worried about catching the bus the mtd has a text messaging service where you can text the bus line with a number and get real time information for when the bus is arriving  let me tell you a text message has saved me more than once from missing the last bus before class starts   the website is unfortunately abbreviated httpwwwcumtdcom but wonderfully comprehensive  ive had generally great luck with the drivers on the    and  and im really glad to have made it to a place with really accessible constant reliable mass transit  im slightly less worried about gas prices as its free for university students to ride the everpresent cumtd system   in short thank you so much chambana mtd for getting me where i need to go all the time every time.

well i went to school here and loved it and i feel like i got a great education it may be huge but once you find your niche you will do just fine you just have to make sure you go to class and take good notes because most classes are so huge they wont harass you to come yet just expect you to i loved the big ten games and the energy of the campus i would never have picked a different place to spend four years.

now thats what i call mediocre  im not a snob when it comes to chinese food at all ive experienced both unnecessarily authentic chinese cuisine and hyperamericanized chinese food and i will go for something inbetween every time  so this place seems like it will fit right in with that but it doesnt the service blows they have a  minimum charge for creditdebit cards  when i told them that was not allowed withiin their contracts with the credit card companies they gave me a blank stare i walked out  the couple of times i have eaten here i was not even mildly enthused about anything  the fried rice has no soy sauce flavor or any particular flavor at all it reminds me of those microwaveable rice cups the meat was chewy and decently flavored but the portion was pretty small not worth the price  dont worry theres about  asian restaurants on green st  im sure that youll find something.

when i went in it smelled overpoweringly like barf remembrance of the stomach bile stink still haunts me whenever i think of or pass by this eyesore it was so strong i couldnt talk listen or even think i could hardly choke down the swill and nod to whatever crap music was playing or in rough acknowledgment of what i thought someone else was saying what did she say this play duckling bucks its pretty loud   needless to say it was also too crowded dark and dirty i realize that i am not exactly in their target market being over  and all but this place is just horrifically bad those that characterize this bar as anything but an unmitigated crapdungeon are either lying to themselves or have never been to a decent bar.

i adopted a dog a few months ago she is a  year old border collie lab mix named lily i know when the dogs are given up the humane society relies on the former family being honest about the dogs behavior i was told she was a friendly sweet lap dog that has never had issues with other animals she gets along with my cat great but when other dogs come along on walks she flips out she even attacked one recently im positive she was abused by her previous family cchs didnt take great care of her either her pads were all torn in her front paws which had her limping for the first few weeks her gums bled like crazy and her teeth were in awful condition and she was too skinny we were ready to give her back because of the strain it put us through we have since turned her around with training and gotten her back to full health but it took hundreds and hundreds of dollars.

we went in there on sunday for lunch it was packedwell the foyer was at least after sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe  full of customers i was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess there was one person taking names another checking the names two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and im hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice so my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with chicken she has a standard and i ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef toss it with some pasta and voila dinner  the humorous moment was when the server asked me how i would like my braised beef doneits braised look it up anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley to make it appear fresh though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good  minutes the salad we got was marginal i dont get what the big deal is and the breadsticks seemed like theyd been sitting in the basket for  minutes not so hot while our food  wasnt absolutely horrible i dont understand why this place is full all the time i would love for it to be another  years or more until i eat here againglad i wasnt paying for it.

common ground gets a lot of flack for being expensive but really its only expensive if youre comparing common grounds organic items to the conventional items at schnucks or meijer  and several time ive noticed common grounds organics were actually priced cheaper than those at the chain stores you also have to consider the fact that common ground is a small independent grocery store that has to have a higher margin in order to survive  and it tries its best to practice what it preaches in its business practices from biodegradable americanmade produce bags to decent employee wages all those little ethical steps cost money  and since the coop is community owned ultimately the money you spend there is going back into the community rather than in some corrupt ceos pocket and thats always a good thing  apart from my pricejustification rant this is the most awesome grocery store in town great deli with vegan options everyday and beautiful produce  often local and organic  that you cant find anywhere else.

this is a small shabbychic french restaurant serving simple french food  the style of cooking is from the brittany region of france in the north and hardier less complex and less delicate than the stereotypical french cuisine  the menu is small is its a little more expensive than the average place in cu but the food we ate was tasty filling and a nice change  i recommend the salmon starter and specials  service was relaxed and friendly but not slow  my parents both enjoyed the coffee.

very good greasyspoon mexican place  my husband and i both had margaritas and they were great not too sweet nice amount of salt  make sure you look at all of the options we ordered fresh which uses fresh lime juice  they have tons of tequila choices  nachos we shared were good and the small order was more than enough for two of us  my husband had the mixed fajitas and enjoyed them  portion was huge and we brought about half of it home i had the pozole and alex taco  both were flavorful  pozole had a nice amount of spice    well return.

i guess there is no way to really make amtrak improve by making a onestar review but i think its awful how expensive it now is to go to chicago given the quality of the service i live in stockholm now and was entertaining notions of going back to champaign to do another degree but reallyits an isolated place if you dont have a car it shouldnt be a big deal to go to chicago it shouldnt use up all my money or my patience ive had  hour delays on amtrak chicago is a major travel hub and the closest major city the fact that it is so difficult to get to hurts the university   sweden benefits enormously from having fast relatively cheap and hasslefree railway i dont have to sit on a cramped bus next to a mcdonalds eating elementary school kid or endure six hour delays on a crappy train to get to places like oslo and copenhagen im bragging now but uiuc needs amtrak to shape up.

did you know the specials are here at the top because the greasily myopic server will remind you of this no matter how frequently you visit  you could get the best damned french toast in the world at sams every weekend and im pretty sure hed still point out the special  did you read what i wrote there  best damned french toast in the world  how is it so good  thats a good question  somehow the combination of totally ordinary white bread and totally ordinary pancake batter transcends the potential of both parts to result in something truly droolworthy a giant slab of golden brown toast in a pool of butter and syrup  if you like french toast theres no reason to consider anything else on the menu  but if you do youll find that they also have grits  a rarity above the masondixon line  swimming in butter crispy bacon truly overmedium eggs and delicious pancakes  the coffee is well blackish but its really not fair to judge a diner on the quality of their coffee  your mug will always be full for better or for worse  my husband and i moved away from champaign in  but make a point of having breakfast at sams whenever were back  there are betterforus breakfasts in champaign  there are fancier breakfasts in champaign  but theres only one sams and well keep coming back as long as it sticks around.
