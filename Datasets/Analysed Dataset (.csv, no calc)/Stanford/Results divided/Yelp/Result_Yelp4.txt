might not be the easiest location to visit or see but its a good option because of the people that work here  tucked away across a parking lot and underneath an overhand is this showmars location but there are a lot of regulars that frequent this place  the servers and folks running the register are super nice and they recognize you call you by name and ask how your work day is going  i take my lunch around pm so way after the lunch rush but i can imagine this place being super busy  there are a lot of tables and booths to sit at and the food comes out fast  with daily specials  super affordable and predictable you can have you food in front of you pretty quickly  especially if you are trying to do a quick lunch  now this place is pretty practical if you work uptown and can walk here for lunch  probably not a place to drive to since you would have to pay for parking somewhere even if you park on the street at a metered spot.

this is a beautiful museum  the space is used well  like a maze though an easy maze as you wind through the exhibits  the cotton gin was my favorite part of the museum the barbers chairs are cool too  there is a small theater also which plays an introduction to the exhibit.
  Positive
interesting museum in uptown from california so it is always interesting to learn about the history of the south great family location for an outing to make the day also educational brought my daughter who enjoyed the interaction displays that made the experience more fun.

for the price i was incredibly disappointed my steak medium rare was totally over cooked our waitress forgot to place one of our side dishes so it came out when we were nearly done our waitress didnt offer any type of modifications for one of our gluten free diners and completely forgot the extra plates we asked for   the only shining items from our meal were the mashed potatoes and wine.

i love chicago hot dogs i have loved them since i was a wee girl therefore any place that makes a real deal vienna beef loaded chicago dog is aces in my book   is matts the best chicago dog ive ever had no is matts the best chicago dog in charlotte maybe for those who are not up to speed on a traditional chicago dog it consists of an all beef frank onions uber green relish yellow mustard sport peppers tomato and a pickle spear hugged into a poppy seed bun matts definitely delivers on these components the dog was a bit snappy like i enjoy and all the condiments were fresh and tasty   the hot dog meal deal   came with the loaded chicago dog a drink and your choice of fries or chips for  i went with the fries and i have to say i was a little bit disappointedthey were a little smushy you can also read tonyas most recent review on her description of the fries regardless though i enjoyed my hot dog so much that i will overlook the limp fries   i definitely want to come back and try a few other menu itemsi see a cheesy beef in my future.

ive been here quite few times and while fh isnt perfect its better than so e of the reviews here make it sound first the bad like other reviews have mentioned sometimes the service can be bit slow its usually fine but it admittedly has a few more bad days than some other places on the other hand they have pretty solid lunch specials great wings the hot bbq are delicious and some nice beer specials  drafts on thursday  domestics yes please they also have plenty of tvs and a pretty good customer rewards program and when it comes to a sports bar what more do you really need.
  Negative
we just received the worst service ever i will never come back its shocking that on wing special night it was merly  tables one person actually went to the back to fix their own drinks we had to ask for everything numerous of times service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly i personally was not thinking to take pictures of all the screw ups due to all of the complaints the whole table was making i hated to make so many complaints but ive never experienced such horrible service it was awful we couldnt find any positive in it as a matter of fact the waitress didnt even come back to pick up all the checks it was  of us and  ppl got their checks we told the management we needed to pay another check and that we didnt know why the waitress would leave one out his response was unprofessional  .

i went for a saturday afternoon world cup game for third place between germany and uruguay  most tables in front of the screen were taken but not packed so it wasnt too noisy  service was really slow but the waitress was authentic  not the best review since i ordered a salad at a pub but the salad was good  fresh  i tried the sweet potato fries too  the fries were a little soggy but will go back under different circumstances to try them out since the beer selection is extensive and within walking distance.

ri ra is one of the coolest bars in charlotte from a decorambiance perspective after work its loud and crowded and energetic  exactly as it should be   what i really wish is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance i ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes  cottage pie what i was served was sparse ground beef frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes i know they were frozen mixed vegetables because i really dont think corn is typically used in cottage pie its just not that hard to make cottage pie or shepherds pie with lamb even in a restaurant environment   stick with a jamesons or guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner.
  Negative
great food i had the hooley kebab for dinner it was on the lunch menu but they still let me order it huge portion tasted my dads lamb stew and loved it it was trivia night so winning  bones certainly helped w that th sta.
really nice outdoor patio sunday drink special on whiskey was really good very reasonable price for uptown nice variations on irish cuisine  worth checking out.

what a place my wife and i came for lunch and left with a new favorite restaurant we dont eat out much but when it comes to sushi we definitely are picky   we showed up early as it was an early day all around for us this place is quaint and just kind of tucked back in the corner of the arboretum we started off lunch with a crunchy california roll as we really didnt know what to get first with the huge menu selection they offer the sushi was phenomenal with just the right amount of everything but not really being in a sushi mood we didnt give any of their amazing sushi a try yet we both decided on the hibachi chicken which came with so much food it was hard to eat it all and the price was so low it was perfect the vegetables and meat were cooked great and the taste was just right my wife is extremely picky about vegetables and she ate them all with the soup and salad and all the other things i dint have any clue why we got the sushi roll im very impressed with this place and will definitely be coming back now for the long wait until next time.

this is a great  stop for a meal if your going to a bobcats game or any event at time warner arena they have covered garage parking for just  and a menu that just wont quit theyve got something for everyone try the mahi tacos two fresh and flavorful  crispy tacos covered with a soft flour tortillathe flavor screams at you if its busy you can get a game of pool on the two billiard tables or sit at the bar and enjoy on of the many big screen plasmas  its a five mimute walk to the bobcats and the blue line lynx with easy access stop to panthers.

while i am not much on chain restaurants rock bottom is certainly a place we will be visting again    my boyfriend and dining partner in crime is a huge beer lover  rock bottom offered a great variety that he was pleased with and the brewery atmosphere is really cool  the spirit and wine offerings were also pretty good with a solid variety of wines and the usual spirits with some fun cocktail options  the menu is huge and offers enough to please anyone  our server was extremely sweet quick and very knowledgeable of the menu  she passed the test when she offered solid beer recommendations with food pairings  the food was surprisingly good  we tried the southwest eggrolls to start holy carbs and cheese and then split a salad with flat bread pizza  once we finished dinner we moved to the barwhich i made a note on to visit for game days  spectacular set up with plenty of seating    the gem of this place is actually the bartenders  im sure that its no surprise that if one sits at a bar they are most likely going to chat with the bartenders  these girls were hilarious and carried on great conversation with us without seeming imposing  which is the key to a great bartender  we were enjoying the atmosphere so much we moved our evening plans to rock bottom and had friends meet us there    good food great service great drinkswe will definitely be back.

went here for a bachelorette party of  girls we had a reservation waited  minutes to be seated was seated a four different tables that we had to asked be pushed together  we then sat at least  minutes before we were greater and our drink order was taken but the drinks took almost  minutes before arriving  when our drinks did arrive the server ran off before taking our dinner order more time passes we order and our food comes out pretty reasonably  minutes  when the food did come out three orders were missing completely our server did not bring our food and was nowhere to be found we sat waiting until finally she came by  at this point weve been here well over an hour  the manager comes by gets the food out says that there would be a free round of drinks for the whole table  i didnt receive the drink promised by the manager and when i asked the server i got a look this was the first and only time i asked her about anything  she brought the drink as i was returning from the restroom and said that an entire bottle of wine would be brought out due to the issues we explained that we had other commitments that it wasnt necessary  then the manager threw in two bottles of champagne at this point im pretty sure he knew that nobody had a great experience and was trying to save face    in the end the manager was great at covering up for the lack of service we received but with so many options in downtown charlotte i would chose another place next time.

after two recent visits here i can honestly say i am torn on my review but overall i know i have had better most recently we arrived shortly after  and were seated indoors because the patio was full and it took our server over  minutes to take our drink order we started off with the spinach artichoke dip and chips which arrived  minutes before our food before i get to the food the appetizer was cold and came with about  chips being there were four of us we asked for some extra chips and some salsa the chips were warm however the salsa stay away unless you like paces from the grocery store really are they kidding serving store bought salsa on to the food  we ordered a good variety stuffed peppers chicken enchiladas burger and chicken sandwich the chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn the enchiladas and peppers were so spicy we had to ask for more water only positive the fries great seasoning as for the service i wish i took her name but our waitress could have given two shabout being there and you could tell no refills never saw her except our order and bill and very blah  not sure we would return anytime soon.

the beer was pretty good but the food was a real disappointment i have always enjoyed the beer at rock bottom and miss their location in atlanta buckhead we sent back the guacamole because it was warm from sitting under a heat lamp i had the pizza and it was mediocre at best  the wings were fine but nothing special  the restaurant was busy but wasnt packed   our food took a long time to come out  we were sitting near the kitchen and could see a number of items sitting under the heat lamps for  minutes  it seemed like the kitchen was putting the food out fast enough but the servers werent getting the food to the tables.
  Very negative
first time here  only thing nice about this place is the location the food from the frozen baked wings  bland mac and cheese  tasteless stuffed brisket burger  and lets not forget the pepperoni pizza that sams food club can do better  this has to be the worse bar food for game watching in charlotte nc .

i recently attended a wedding at the charlotte city club and it was gorgeous not only is it a beautiful venue with a fabulous view but the meal was highquality hands down the best macaroni and cheese on the planet it was definitely one of the best dinners ive had at a wedding they also did a great job of ushering everyone to the reception and the service was excellent  reason for  stars  i wondered if the bride and groom were paying based on consumption because the drinks were incredibly stiffoverly so i had to ask them to water mine down more than a few times  also the top floor can accommodate several people but there are a few rooms rather than one large one so we missed out on the cake cutting because we were in the room with the band for that reason i would prefer a location with one large space for a wedding reception but overall it was a very beautiful space.

im really trying to branch out more into uptownye though i walk through the valley of deathoops i digress  the hubbs and i had a guest in town and he suggested we eat here  i happened to take a chance on this place without consulting yelp and i have to say im glad i again see golden taipei went out on blind faith  i got the ravioli peccasomethingitaliansounding and it was tasty  had those cute broccoli and sundried tomatoesmmm mmm  my husband got some sort of roast beef sammie and the meat was cooked au jus needless to say he was full and happy and our guest joyfully guzzled down some chicken wings because apparently where he lives in west bumble virginia no one makes chicken wings but thats another blasphemy for another day  what makes me a fan is the fullyloaded bar and drink selection  our waitress made a wonderful recommendation based off of how i was feeling libra love crown royal malibu rum pineapple juice and raspberry somethingorothercan you tell it worked and i appreciated how she kept the rounds coming our guest enjoyed jack  coke  the atmosphere was pretty chill and they can cater to larger parties so im already thinking about some type of girls night outing including presto  this would also be a great date night spot reserved for pay day weekends.

im visiting charlotte for work and found this place through restaurantcom  im glad i did  i went with a friend from the area who was a little weary about its location but was pleasantly surprised by the inside  its cute and quaint with a touch of modern flair  we each started with a martini as they are all  dollars on thursdays normally   the waters didnt actually come until after the martinis which is a little backwards but the martinis were welcomed with open arms  and were yummy  the food came out quickly and hot i ordered the pasta primavera with creamy pesto and added shrimp  it was nicely flavored it was chalk full of goodies and the portion was more than enough  i was disappointed that i didnt have a fridge in my hotel to take home the leftovers  my friend ordered the grits  definitely a good dish but i would not recommend it to those who dont like spicy food because it had quite a cajun kick  all in all a good experience  check it out.

great service but this is honestly the worst food i have ever eaten out at a restaurant in my life i dont suggest going here for food ever maybe for the drink specials and hookah but nothing else.

summary  beautiful hotel highly errorprone staff   it is rare to find a hotel as beautiful as this the look is very modern which i happen to love it has a decent gym which is also rare for a hotel there is a very soothing bar area with live gentle jazz music  the staff are very professional in demeanor and friendly  this could be an awesome place to stay   i experienced the following over two stays  i arrive pm exhausted from travel only to be told that the hotel is full  the only room they have left to offer me is half a parlor room i was given a sofa bed to sleep on i had made the reservation several weeks prior with guaranteed late arrival   i get to the room and the electronic key does not work i call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall  minutes half asleep for a guard to show up his key does not work either    ok this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels right    i gave a shirt and slacks to laundry that evening i receive someone elses underwear instead of my own clothes   i gave a pair of jeans to dry clean specifying not to wash because they would shrink well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size  a pattern develops  on the third night around pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door he claims to be security but show no identification  he wants to see my id  highly suspicious i dont open the door and i slip my gym copy of my license under the door later he returns with police and insists i accompany them to the front desk later they apologize for the error  what were they were thinking  a waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a  minute period the bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time   a gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen   the weather report button on the phone gives you a recording describing yesterdays weather  etcetera  bottom line  stay here for the serenity and beauty of the decor but you will need the patience of a saint.

like most other westins the decor is very nice and rooms are spacious and full of amenities the bar and the restaurant is pretty good location is in  downtown but certainly on the edge of town  deducting one star since they dont have a platinumconcierge lounge.

there are much better choices in uptown charlotte  let me start with the goodthe front desk staff the three people who assisted me at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful great customer service  now the badstains there is no other way to describe everything in my room multiple stains on the carpeting and the comforter the bathrobe hanging on the back of the bathroom door had a huge brown stain on the sleeve that i kept telling myself was makeup from the last occupant every yes every bath towel had a stain either black or yellow there was stained grout behind the toilet like it had leaked sometime in the past even the shower curtain was stained then there was the hair dryer it was sooooo sticky that i didnt even want to touch it it appeared to be covered in about  years worth of cheap hairspray   i can appreciate that the hotel is getting older and may need a renovation soon but come on people  how about you splurge and replace your bath towels and hair dryers now    let me be clear that i think the cleaning staff is doing the best they can with what they have been given they just need a better starting product.
  Negative
ive stayed here for four years in a row and this go around have noticed a serious decline in service and quality  there was only one employee available to check people in and after a full day i waited  minutes to check in  as a result i didnt have time to go up to the room before leaving for dinner  they said that my bags would be delivered to my room but when i got back at  pm ready to collapse they were no where to be found  there was standing water in the tub and the shower head was only partially working  not the kind of experience i expect from a hotel where there are additional fees for everything  im talking  for one day of parking    i have high standards for this place since my previous stays have been great  why are you slacking westin charlotte.
  Negative
quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life noisy dirty poorly renovated and the worst customer service known to man the way i was treated by the front desk was enough reason to never step foot within a mile radias of this place doesnt even deserve one star in my book   avoid at all costs.

i totally agree with you that time warner cable has one of the worst customer service i have come across  sorry for the comment  they may be the only service provider in this area that they do not care or the employees have not been paid enough that they do not care about their job  i signed up as they knocked at my door  like someone said we need internet nowadays  we need cable tv in order we can get national or world news more informatory program or some quality programs  they were fast to install for you  but when you do not have service it takes forever to talk to someone on the phone or they hanged you up after waiting forever  however when i wanted to seek their help they would not answer you without a pin and kept transfer you to so many departments really that big i dont know till your phone call dropped  that will take you hours on the phone without a solution  as i need to move and cancel the account they will give you a hard time  watch out this company.
  Negative
time warner cable is an incompetent company that runs a monopoly on internet services in certain neighborhoods  they will enroll you in bill pay then charge you late fees when their service fails to draw funds  not failure to draw funds from a lack of cash in the account  no this is a failure to draw funds because their billing department is complete and utter garbage  their services are sub par and they over charge for this shit service because as previously stated they run the only line available for entire neighborhoods and small towns through out the charlotte area.

after taking three afternoons off work to wait for technicians that never showed up my internet was finally installed at which point i was informed that even though i ordered wireless wireless isnt available unless you pay an extra  monthly fee for the router the technician a very nice guy advised me to purchase my own router which i did when i called time warner to register the ip i was informed that there is a separate  a month fee to use your own router  horrible horrible company i hope all the ceos get halitosis and their wives leave them for john mayer.

it is the first time i gave rated review while i normally gave  stars regardless of service quality the worst service came from twc took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done all they did is to transfer the phone call to another representative after telling me i cant do this i cant do that worst service ever.

ok so i finally dined here and lets say disappointing wasnt even the wordif im going to be dropping a large sum of money down i want it to be on food that i actually enjoyed   i went a few weeks ago and we opted for the three course chefs tasting menuwell lets just say if these dishes were a reflection of any chef well they truly shouldnt be one right down to the presentations   for my first course i had the baked beans as we called it not at all what i expected to get and  barely any duck confit in it as it said on the menu very boring and missing lots of flavors so yes they tasted and looked like baked beans then second course i had the tomato with goat cheese and peas i had one bite and did not go back for another the plate was filled with tomato liquid and the goat cheese was running right in it  yuck is all i have to say then finally our last course my favorite is rack of lamb so of course im now anticipating my lamb i had asked for it to be cooked raremedium rare just in case they were to over cook it well sure enough it came out medium wellnow i would have sent it back but my friend had ordered his steak medium well and got his rare so i didnt want to be that table that sent everything back  only good thing about this place was my company it is outdated they may want to rethink theyre concept again and possibly add a few woman servers in there to bring some life to this place finally this place was stale like the bread.

taking in a surprise   taking a light outdoor walk from camden southend to the streets of uptown charlotte sure makes one hungry the first place that caught my eye was a resilient green light coming off south tryon it was so bright it was reflecting off the mirror statue at the betchlor museum across the street the next thing i know i am staring the menu at the best table in the house if you have ever walked past this place you know what table it is the light music and privacy of the booth makes for intimate conversation and romantic situations the comfortable and spacious booth allows you to play footsy all night without hurting yourself   i had the mussels which were euphoric cooked in some type of wine butter and cream which happen to be damn good when mixed together my palate was very pleased and upset at the same time pleased with the sauce from the mussels running down my face but upset when the last empty shell fell with the others happily in a coma after being satisfied by a taste i could only once wonder about i got myself the check i didnt care how much it was it was good the service was astounding and i was so comfortable at this point i could not even set a price on this kind of experience popped it open and to my surprise i walked out of there paying less than  for two peoplewines appitizersdesserts   after stumbling to the door trying to shake off my coma i gave one glance back at the place of magic and thought to myself ill be back here before i know it to take on a new adventure for my taste buds.

ive gotten massages from modern salon several times and loved them all there until the last time when i lost my penchant after learning the masseuse i had used before no longer worked there his replacement was a woman who did nothing but make me more tensed up than when i came in it wasnt until after i already paid for the service gave her a tip and went home that i started thinking in retrospect then got mad that i actually paid for something that made me feel worse it was some time ago so i will have to call them to see if her names on record so i can recommend not using her i dont think she listened to a word i said i had the hour massage and i explained to her before hand that i wanted her to mainly focus on my upper back  neck because i had a lot of pain in the area from working on the computer  until finishing a job that week i also told her i prefer harder pressure i have never had a massage like that before she did nothing but tickle me i told her at least twice that she can use more pressure but i guess she didnt care then she ends up paying the least amount of attention to my problem areas i asked her to focus on i guess i was being too nice i should have asked for someone else but i didnt want to hurt her feelings   i havent had a massage there since then but i love getting my haircuts there ive had a few different stylists but loved each one they were especially helpful when i had to undergo chemotherapy treatments which made me lose all of my hair when it finally started growing back in it was a mess they helped my hair to look  feel so much better and healthier   the staff are all friendly and pleasant the spa upstairs is nice and separated from the more chaotic salon and registers the spas waiting area is comfy and quiet and the dressing roomsshowerssauna room is nice and offers a nice assortment of aveda products to test out.

im maybe im missing something here because i found the place to be really underwhelming the service was excellent friendly and fast but the food was    eh i kept getting a chemical taste off of the food and im not normally someone who is sensitive to that kind of thing i got the brisket tacos and they ended up being  kind of chemical artificial tasting and  watery from the salsa not really a good combination maybe i chose poorly but i wasnt impressed at all.

knowing my love for salsaritas on rea road a coworker and i decided to head there for lunch we arrived shortly after  and like others have mentioned the line was out the entryway  however even though the line was long it moves smoothly and didnt take too long  salsaritas has a rhytmn that seems to work like an assembly line i ordered the two taco combo with chips and queso and a side of salsa  i chose two soft tacos which are steamed and topped with a meat of which i chose chicken and pulled pork onto the toppings lettuce jalepeno sour cream guacamole and cheese to complete my order  the chicken just like the other location was great and the pulled pork was awesome i wil definitely try that again  the chips were fresh some with a little extra seasoning that i love  the queso was a little cold but overall good  a definite great spot for lunch but may need to think about getting there a few minutes before  just to get ahead the large crowd.

i have been to the actors theatre for several productions now and i always forget to review them  from chaps to the evil dead to rocky horror some are packed some are well less than packed but they never disappoint  if you should happen by on opening night they typically have an extra special event where you get some tasty goodies from the sponsor seems like it is usually the same one but it may change from show to show as well  they also have a cult movie night on all many some mondays with free admission and popcorn so be sure and check that out if you are looking for something to do  like most places they have a nice little bar and drink prices are not too bad but it would be nice if they would give you the whole beer instead of pouring  of it or so into a cup  i do not know if they keep the extra little bit for themselves or the next guy in line but it is just one of those things that can be a little annoying you know.

wow this place is excellent  i grew up in charlotte and sadly never discovered this place until after i moved away i heard a couple of great recommendations and my family decided to try it out   the meal starts out with some outstanding cornbread so buttery it seems light and almost melts in your mouth we also got a fried green tomato appetizer which was really good between the four of us we had  orders of salmon cakes delish fried chicken and ribs and probably one of each of the sides i would definitely recommend the salmon cakes again fried chicken and ribs are a bit heavy for me but my dad and brother went to town everything was really good and made me lament living so far away from good southern cookin  then there was dessert while my mom brother and i were unbuttoning the top button of our pants and trying to make a little bit more room my dad was going strong we ended up with a slice of sweet potato cake divine and a slice of coconut cake to take home for later the waitress told us that all of the cakes are made by a woman in her home and we could just imagine what her house must smell like   our server was super friendly and comfortabl.

cool restaurant  i went here on a monday afternoon with the wife dad and grandpa while paying a little visit to charlotte  my dad and grandpa live in charlotte and told us we had to try merts  cornbread was excellent  we all got our own little loaf as a starter  entrees come with two sides and i got the pulled pork as the main dish and okra and green beans  the pulled pork was a little stringy and very vinegary but unique    wife got the salmon cakes and i didnt really care for them  i told her she shouldnt have ordered that but oh well  her mac and cheese was great though  my grandpa ordered the fried chicken and it looked great and he really enjoyed it  i tried a few bites and it was very moist and crispy  i dont remember what my dad ordered  i like how they have tons of cool side dishes here and theyre all soul foodtype items  we have tons of good restaurants in southern california but nothing like merts  if i came back id probably order the fried chicken or the catfish if im feeling exotic  they probably have about  or so sides  a good mixture of carbs and veggies  i wish i tried the fried green tomatoes  well ill be back someday to try something different  im glad my dad and grandpa took us here.

i really wanted to get grub at prices but they dont have a dining area and i didnt want to get take out  came here for lunch  waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved  free cornbread was average   i had the fried chicken and sides of mashed potatoes and mac n cheese  surprisingly none of it was really that good  service was cheerful though  i guess the best part was i was able to park in downtown charlotte found a free spot and wasnt towed when i was done eating here.

not a lot to say other than great southern comfort food good fried chicken great beef ribs small servings of ribs but great flavor loved the collard greens and coconut cake id go back definately worth trying.

merts is true southern soul food  not the new american type but the real stuff  macncheese green beans cooked in animal fat salmon cakes fried chicken  its all good  i love the macncheese and will often just order a veggie plate where i can pick  different ones to eat  they always have vegetable specials so i can try something new every time i go    they also had  different hot sauces on the table  i made a point to sample them all on the delicious corn bread they make.

the worst customer service by server and manager weve been coming here for years tonights experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences ive ever had supposedly there was a computer error with our food fine i understand it happens sometimes however while waiting two hours we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner we got the same response every time itll be right up he did not consider actually checking on the food all the tables around us came ate and left meanwhile our server could not even remember to bring water to the table without being asked multiple times   after i stopped asking nicely about our food the server finally went to inquire the manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave how generous otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers she did not even follow through on that promise we were given one free beer each pathetic over  of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention people who make it a point to dine here every time we come   the server never apologized nor did he bother to even clear our plates  there are plenty of other places to spend your money where it will be appreciated.
  Very negative
such amazing soul food seriously some of the best collard greens ever its a shame that such awesome food can be disappointed by such horrible service we waited for over an hour for an omelette and a vegetable plate the waitress could have cared less that we had to wait our drinks stayed empty for most of the meal and it took  minutes and repeated requests for a small packet of mustard we are from out of town and had heard such amazing things about this place once again great food but super horrible service not sure due to the service that we will return the next time we are in charlotte.

stars   one of the few places where i can safely say that anything you order from the menu will be sure to please mimosa is one of downtown charlottes original great restaurants there long before all the big chain steakhouses decided to take up residence this place is as safe as it gets and doesnt break the bank doing it the decor is very fashionable and presents a really nice atmosphere without feeling too white tableclothlike  i really like the upscale southern idea and not many places in the country can pull it off as well or as consistently as mimosa does they specialize in local produce and meats doing a great job of supporting all the great foods natural to nc any time one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant is a beefsteak salad you know they focus on all the details because it takes a lot more than you would think to make a really good salad  whether youre a charlotte native or just visiting the city for business mimosa should definitely be on your list of places to try if you want a real taste of charlotte it may be easy to go with the big chains like mortons capital grill and ruths chris but your money will be much better spent and go a lot further here.

mimosa is fantastic i went there for lunch recently for my friends birthday i had the best cheeseburger ive ever had in my life it was topped with bacon and cheddar cheese but the burger itself was just seasoned perfectly mm mm it is on the pricey side but its definitely more reasonably priced for lunch so id recommend checking it out then as other yelpers have said its just one of those restaurants where everything you order is likely to be good.

i enjoyed a  course brunch at mimosa we had a good discussion with our waiter about the area and the meal nice ambiance and food was top notch i look forward to trying lunchdinner in the future.

we had a disappointing experience with customer service regarding a group reservation in fact they have yet to call back to confirm or cancel if they cant get a reservation right what else would have gone wrong.

youve gotta get the fried fish sandwich while down here for a conference my coworker who was local convinced me i had to try the fish sandwichand get one to take on the plane too while the crinkle cut fries are uber tasty theyre not the most amazing thing ive ever had the mac and cheese was a good call more on the gooey side and the fish while messy was simply astounding all for approx  too plus theyre a local charlotte family chain which i absolutely adore service was prompt the only thing is that they close at pm   if i ever get to come back to charlotte ill pick up some showmars.

ok so i was in a pasta type of mood and decided to try luce to see if all the hype was legitand ill just say that luce has been added to my italiano list  i had the express lunch which includes bread soup or salad an entree and a drink for  guaranteed in  minutes or less  the soup of the day was lobster bisque which was super yummy with the bread and my entree was the butteratubular pasta italian sausage sweet peas and tomatocream saucedouble yummy  hand clap for luce i may just have to check out their sister restaurants too.

since i have promised myself that im not allowed to move away from charlotte until i have eaten at every restaurant i figured that restaurant week would be a perfect time to visit luce a small uptown spot that has been on my list for years  upon arrival our table wasnt quiet ready  no problem there because the suggestion to grab a drink at the bar was a given  tucked away in the corner the attentive bargoddess quickly poured us wine and presented us with nibbles  supercrunchy potato chips which appeared to be made in house as well as a heaping handful of olives were placed in front of us    these olives    i wanted to fall asleep in a bowl if these olives  i dont know what kind of magic the cooksakaolivewizards behind the scenes of the closed kitchen put into them fresh garlic fresh rosemary tears of their first born but im talking life changing like little baby angels    the food was great service attentive and friendly ill definitely be backfor the olives.

not impressed  if there were  stars thats the rating this place would get  i ordered a cheeseburger and it was worse than what youd expect from a school lunchroom   and why is this place called an irish pub  one would expect typical irish dishes but not here  i honestly have no idea how this place stays in business  sorry hartigans i wont be going back.

what the hell phils tavern every time i come here usually before a show things just dont work out i wanted them to but they just didnt  food the only food ive tried here were the jalapano poppers and then i never tried anything here again how do you burn something in a deep fryer normally id just be impressed but i was hungry   drinks their drink specials are nothing to write home about the dirty martini was weak and the tiny shrivelled spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress at least it was only  unfortunately the corona of the person i was with only cost fifty cents less than that  for a warm corona do not want  service nice but few and far between  atmosphere dank dirty sticky these are only a few of the descriptors for this place i fear the day where i will have no choice but to use the facilities here  overall  dont waste your time and money i hear theres better places in this area i just need to find them.
  Negative
i dont much like the look of this place  i never would have ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews  but they serve some pretty good pizza    i have eaten trillions of pizzas  maybe more i lost count  and im not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza  i grew up in chicago where i was weaned on deep dish pan and thin crust pizzas  i lived in nyc for years and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet  for the record my favorites are difaras in brooklyn and coalfire a relatively young pizza joint in chicago  brixx does a fine job of the thin crust  we had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks  both were pretty tasty    ill go back for more whenever the opportunity arises  but heres what they could do a little better  get that oven hotter and change the flour blend so that theres a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust  theres an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like if that shit dont crack that shit is whack  so when the pizza is folded the bottom of the crust should crack  ditto for the edge of the crust  allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust like spinach ricotta etc  brixxs pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere  it was cooked only to the point of being breadlike  still tasty enough but not quite there  i hate to sound snotty about this but i think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning  that crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible  also the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula but when that was added the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didnt melt at all and the arugula didnt wilt  the result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza  pizza aside they offer local beers at least one nc wine and have ecofriendly waterless urinals in the mens room i applaud the effort though that probably wont be the highlight of the review  next time i go in ill see it they can crispify my pie.
  Negative
this is our first time coming to brixx and we really enjoyed it we ordered the pear and gorgonzola and the bronx bomber the  pear and gorgonzola was unique the bronz bomber had good flavor and a nice balance of ingredients personally i would have like them to be a little more crispy but thats just a personal preference   what i really liked was that the manager came to each table to introduce himself and make sure the customers were happy its rare to see managers touch tables great customer service and great food.

good food at the right prise the wait staff was friendly and helpful when ordering enjoy the night and eat outside.

i finally got a chance to eat here thanks to one of my friends very generous christmas gift ive only ever been in for drinks so dinner was a first  we sat in a big booth for just the  of us and i started with the pineapple stoli doli and it is dangerous i could have had like i didnt but i could have we started with the shrimp cocktail and wagyu beef carpaccio both were good   for my entree i had the porcini rubbed delmonico ribeye when it came out it was huge and perfectly cooked we had gotten  sides starting with the lobster mac n cheese which was very good but like my friend said there was nothing that made it omg we also had the onion rings and sauteed spinach which were also good  we had the creme brulee for dessert and that was perfectly lighter than i thought it was going to be and just the right amount of sweetness to finish the dinner  our server was very nice and helped when it came to picking out the wine and his suggestion was great we all enjoyed it.
  Positive
my mouth is watering just thinking of the capital grille in charlotte i dont get to come here that often considering the price tag but when i do its always nothing short of super fantastic this particular capital grille is very classy from the service to decor to the selections of food and wine the staff is very attentive professional and informative the food is insanely delicious and could feed you for days on end   capital grille hands down receives my best cheesecake in charlotte award i usually describe their cheesecake as this its a ny cheesecake with a cookie doughlike crust instead of a graham cracker crust and with a cremebrulee sugarflambeed topping its freakin unbelievable i would get just that cheesecake togo on a random night if i ever wanted to   but i digress they also have a nice patio on the sidewalk of tryon and th st if you fancy peoplewatching while you enjoy a  course meal theyve also just added a lunch bites menu that is for those who need to eat and run at a much smaller price than their usual dinner fare  capital grille is just the place to go if youre looking to impress business clients for a classy date night or for a special occasion with family or friends make a reservation and be prepared to eatdrink like royalty and drop money like youre makin it rain.

to quote espn cmon man  how about putting a decent product on the floor  and where is michael jordan  does he attend games  the night we went they were playing the celtics  btw we are big celtics fans  it reminded me of seeing a red sox game in camden yards  in other words felt like a home game for boston  as in most sporting arenas the concessions are ridiculously overpriced  two sodas that you would pay    for at a fast food place cost   i also ordered a jerk chicken sandwich  did it come straight from the refrigerator  cold cold cold  back to the concessions why do we the joe q publics of the world put up with that  next time im eating before and will visit the local water fountain for a drink  at the end of the game i went to meet a fellow yelper and we were chatting for no more than  minutes when an usher came along and said we needed to vacate  thanks for coming now get the  out  haha  he was very pleasant about it  well no more celtics visits until next season  see you then.

maybe its because i went on a thursday with colleagues but apparently its rb night or jazz night or something  they play some old school cds really loud so its hard to maintain a decent conversation  on top of that its old school cds bc the music would skip  we asked them to turn it down off and their response was its rb night  uh so who cares literally there was us and  old cougars sitting at the bar  thats about it note we were not sitting with these cougars but the amount of times they were looking over at our table i thought it was feeding time  feeling like a piece of meat sheesh  hardly a rb night if you ask me  beers were fine i liked the multitude of screens  but its so dead on thursday bc of jazz night  just giving them a heads up lets trash that idea yeah     lol  other corporate dudes walked in was looking around saw cougars  music skipping and peaced out  we totally should have done that  dmo out.

avoid this place at all costs the food is disgusting i honestly never had food this horrible in my entire life from the frozen crab cakes to the unseasoned grouper my experience left me confused and hungry this is simply a marriott hotel restaurant  not an award winning restaurant by any means.

went to the belk bowl here i couldnt believe how nice the stadium is inside when atlanta builds a new stadium they need to take note i was impressed by the food selection  quality the bathrooms stayed clean  the attendants were all very nice  smiling kudos to the designers  managers of this facility we had a nice visit to charlotte  a w in the boa stadium.
  Negative
only two stars due to the lack of selection  no food menu and inside is like a dungeon  they do have a nice outside area with tvs and a rather secluded environment  one of these stars is because of their sunday special   car bomb shots  other than that they really dont have any other specials  i asked the bartender why that was his response we dont want to attract that kind of crowd  what crowd would that be sir hmmmmm pass on this place    ian m.
when im out and people ask for advice about where they should go next i send them here  i love this place it could be packed or completely empty doesnt matter i always have a good time sober or drunk yes i have in fact been here sober go ahead bring the jokes  connollys is like a family many of the bartenders have worked here for years they are all super friendly and damn good at slinging drinks these are the same masterminds involved in tyber creek dandelion and prohibition they know what theyre doing  the patio is huge perfect for after work cocktails or sunday funday cornhole tables tvs pick your poison speaking of poison if youre in the mood for a car bomb go here to get it and be sure to buy me one   fridays and saturdays you can typically expect a cover its usually just  youll find that at several bars in uptown  im happy this uptown staple is not only still kicking it but also remains one of the most popular watering holes in center city i know i dont have to say this but dont ever change connollys.

fastest year of my life the growth panel is complete and we couldnt be happier the last session was the most fun since our daughter has started experiencing separation anxiety i didnt think wed get huge laughs and smiles i was wrong jeff and becky worked really well with her and helped direct me to get the best shots they had great toys that she responded enthusiastically toward   when i returned for the proof appt it was difficult to pay attention because i had my daughter with me and she was all over the place becky walked with her to the next room where they had more toys and i listened to them play she didnt cry remember shes been having separation anxiety she actually had a fun time they were really nice and patient with us.

theres a reason i avoid bagel sandwiches but i thought id give it another try i ordered the thai chicken sandwich which consists of a plain bagel smeared with cream cheese lettuce cucumber and a  chicken breast and it comes with a cup of thai peanut sauce tasty indeed however what a large mess this made as we all know bagels arent the easiest breads to bite smear on cream cheese add slick things like lettuce and cucumber and now you have a very messy meal the cream cheese is of sort of like grease on a bush hog  everything wants to squirt out no showers are in bathroom which is too bad as i needed one after eating my sandwich with this said the staff was very nice i just need to avoid bagel sandwiches.
  Negative
this brueggs kinda sucks every time ive come they are out of multiple kinds of bagels so someone isnt doing their counts correctly use to work at a brueggers the service is lousy also apparently brueggers discontinued sproutsnot this stores fault but wtf sprouts are awesome going to poppys next time.

staff was very friendly but food and drinks were disappointing this place markets itself as martini specialists but i had to ask for my martini to be remade a second time as it came without olives also  olives were standard jarred fair a much better martini can be had at urban sip above the ritz  they have spanish giant olives handstuffed with blue cheese.

in the tradition of full disclosure i never really liked quiznos that much anywayim more of a firehouse or harris teeter hoagie guy but the other day i was hungry on lunch and decided to give them a try  the roast beef and cheddar looked pretty good  but it wasnt  it had a weird sort of taste and with every other bite or so i would notice these odd little mushroom bitsyou know like the canned mushrooms and the seasoning and added flavors were not to my liking  not to mention the after effectsugggghnever again quiznosnever again.

we went to dixies tavern before the bobcats arena opened ie when you could find free parking in uptown  we parked in seventh street station for free back then and walked across the street to dixies   places like roadhouse grill logans roadhouse and texas roadhouse are designed to look a bit rundown andlike a roadhouse  dixies was unpurposefully like that  it was smoky a bit dirty and a bit haggard in its appearance    we had a large group and dixies was able to accommodate us together  the service we received was slllllllllooooooooow  it was a good thing we didnt have anywhere to be but i was losing my buzz in between beers  the food was averag.
  Negative
very poor customer service have a special listed saying  items for  but if you have  items they charge you full price and you are not eligible for the cheaper rate they also dont count your items and list the number on your claim check so if something is lost your out of luck there are too many options in uptown i will not try them again.
  Negative
when parking uptown they are really your only option  which is fine as some of their lots have reasonable rates  my reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing and their overall customer service  my main problem with them aside from rude people is that there is no way to update your payment information online  my credit card was cancelled and upon receiving my new card midmarch i called immediately to update my information so come april they would have updated information  obviously i would have much rather done this all online but alas there was no other option but to call  they assured me that the new card was placed on file and we were good to go  fast forward to april th and i receive an email saying that my card did not go through and i would be fined an additional   they had charged the wrong card  they sent me this email on saturday afternoon and i immediately called only to be told that the people who handle payments dont work on weekends and i would need to call back during business hours the girl could have been a lot nicer  i call first thing monday morning and explain what happennot in an accusing tone by any means because im well aware that the likelihood of the girl i was speaking to having made this mistake was slim so why yell at the messenger  she immediately responded in a defensive tone saying there is no way that error could have occurred and it was my fault for not giving them the new information  i tried to explain again the course of events and she would not have it  she updated my credit card information now for the second time so lets see if it goes through for may  overall here is how i feel  tremendous amount of parking options offered in uptown poor customer service poor user experience overpriced  if youre going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year at least give me decent people  and if you dont give me decent people then give me a way to do what i need to do online so i dont have to deal with them.

the toenail in the carpeting and booger on the desk told me all i needed to know about the omni  i wont even go into the mildewy bathroom ceiling   i can scarcely believe this is an omni after staying at pittsburgs omni  the lobby is beautiful but they have a long way to go to be a decent hotel  there are swatches out all over the place connoting a redecoration but i wonder if its all because the ritz is being built across the street.

gross  i can not believe my experience with this hotel i started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in i was at the westin  weeks prior which was amazing and a very great experience so i thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more people are coming i want to get an even better place so the omni i thought would be great and its right next to epicenter were made reservations at flemings  we took pictures of how disgusting the room looked there was a cockroach wing not in a corner but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor the chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained i stayed at the westin just  weeks before and the omni couldnt even hold a candle to that place i have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel it is the worst room i have ever stayed in ever  there is nothing modern about the hotel there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date the last time i saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach i dont care how close this is to epicenter its not worth the price we had friends from out of town that just couldnt believe how gross the room was we only stayed one night thank god  the front desk people were snarky and made you feel as if you were being judged you have to walk by them any time you leave your room the whole experience was awful and uncomfortable i am going to post the pics.

avoid this place like they serve salmonella  our dining experience at this restaurant was the worst i can remember  we sat for over  minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up  i ordered what the waiter claimed was their signature dish paella latorre  it was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm  i called over the waiter and explained   minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had reheated it  while the plate was hot the food was still tepid  i called the waiter over again and told him  he argued that he saw the chef reheat the food  by this time my business associate had almost completed his meal so i ate as much as i could and left about   we told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check  he returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do  we called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he would do  the following week i contacted blerim meta the general manager of this restaurant as well as aquavina  he has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience  avoid this restaurant  avoid aquavina.

i have had the baked chicken thursday special and it is wonderful a great change from all the chain and fast food restaurants downtown it does get very crowded and little awkward when it is that way  the food comes fast and is delicious i have only been here for weekday lunches usually thursday my coworkers love the other specials too  if you are looking for a change from the everyday this place is a great one to start.

bleah  i went here because i was staying at the westin across the street  we had about  people for dinner  the decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired  i started by ordering a couple bottles of wine and one came incorreclty which was pretty bad considering i ordered it by number  the waiter had all the personality of a rock  ok no biggie but then came the food  i ordered a  chicken breast that was supposed to come with hushpuppy breaded shrimp and some type of ravioli  the food came out at different times which left some of our food getting cold  when my chicken showed up it appeared to be boiled and had some really bad sauce on it that i cant explain  it was pretty unedible after a couple of bites  also the shrimp came  butterflied and sauteed definatly not as described on the menu   all in all i would skip this place the food is bad one star for the decour and wine list  but they even managed to screw up the wine order.

i used to love this restaurant and have brought out of town guest there for dinner in the past years but this restaurant has gone downhill and should no longer be in business  my last visit was at lunch with other work colleagues a couple of weeks ago  i ordered seared ahi tuna salad  when it arrived it was pretty obvious that the ahi tuna was old and on its way to being rancid  i was appalled that any real chef would ever serve anything that looked that bad  i was in a business setting where i did not want to make a scene so i ate only the vegetables and did not touch the tuna for fear of getting sick  the waitress never ask me if there was anything wrong with my dish even though it should have been obvious to her that i pretty much left the fish untouched  if youre uptown do yourself a favor and go to halcyon mimosa grille ruth chris or bernardin before going here for lunch.

i like to refer to this place as the key shack if you drive by thats exactly what it looks like a little shack in the middle of park road shopping center it make look a little sketch there was some homemade bbq for sale next to the shack when i was here a few weekends ago but they get the job done  i went here after a referral from a friend i was looking for a hard to find key to duplicate for one of the uptown residential buildings sure enough they had the key here i had a new key and exchanged cash in about  minutes if you have a hard to find key to duplicate  this is your spot  plus one youre done you can stroll through the rest of park road shopping center if you so desire cupcakes coffee michaels antiques its all here.

zero stars for this guy  i called because we had a flood in our home but when the floors were ripped up the water mitigator said we had a problem with our dishwasher and needed to have it checked for leaks  my home warranty company gave me the number to carolina appliance service  i left a message and got a call back right away  when i told the guy my situation he stopped me and said he was not interested in working with me because he was worried that if he did a bad job the insurance company would be coming after him  he actually started an argument with me  i assume he was the owner because he said my company  but my simple question was isnt that what you do  fix dishwasherswhy is this company even on my home warrantys list of providers  he argues so much that i didnt even get to tell him this wasnt part of an insurance claim  so to recapvery rude with obviously no confidence in his own work  dont call these guys.

carowinds in my opinion is crap poor customer service in all parts of the park managers of the park know this and they dont do a thing about it six flags a few hours away is so much better carowinds for that they offer is not worth the drive or the money the food is very pricey and its not that great.

i wholeheartedly agree with mike k  for your money this is a great deal in charlotte the dowd y is a very nice gym that offers a bevy of group fitness classes up to date and always functioning equipment and a super clean atmosphere   why i love this y in particularthe machines are always in service and ive head that techs are out fixing them weekly if need be they also do not allow any children under the age of  in the workout areas now dont get me wrong i love kids just not when im trying to get my sweat on   as mentioned before this y offers so many great group classes im a big fan of total strength pilates mat and kickboxing ive also heard the spin classes are great ive tried athletic conditioning and while it certainly is an awesome workout make sure youre at least in decent shape before you partake in that class its a rough one   as other reviewers have noted this gym can get packed especially after  pm during the weekdays so be patient while parking some classes can get a bit crowded too so keep that in mind when youre sprawling out your mat or equipment   i havent had any issues with theft in the locker room but im a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker for the money and the friendly service the dowd ymca is a great deal for anyone looking to slim down or tone up.

wait  mins to get a parking spot then wait  for a machine no thanks just cancelled and move to fitness connection for  bucks a month for that price i can go to a swanky yoga studio on the weekends and still be cheaper than the y this place is seriously over sold stop selling more memberships when you dont have enough space or equipment to accommodate current members serious over crowding issue.

this is the place to be in charlotte i am a nighttime gymgoer and i needed a gym with late night hours the dowd is open until  during the week which while i would prefer  works for me also going at nonpeak hours saves me from the parking and crowding issues that others seem to face aint no crowds at  pm i generally stay in the womens fitness center which is a gym inside itself but every now and then ill make it upstairs the desk staff is always friendly and there are plenty of amenities to utilize the one area i havent ventured into yet are the group exercise mainly for scheduling reasons but i am eager to sneak into one one day.
