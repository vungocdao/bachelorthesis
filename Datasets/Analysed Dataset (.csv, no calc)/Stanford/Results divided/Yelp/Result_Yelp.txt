contrary to other reviews i have zero complaints about the service or the prices i have been getting tire service here for the past  years now and compared to my experience with places like pep boys these guys are experienced and know what theyre doing  also this is one place that i do not feel like i am being taken advantage of just because of my gender other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars and have sucked my bank account dry but here my service and road coverage has all been well explained  and let up to me to decide  and they just renovated the waiting room it looks a lot better than it did in previous years.

last summer i had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time i also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on they fixed it for free and the very next morning i had the same issue i called to complain and the manager didnt even apologize so frustrated never going back  they seem overpriced too.

friendly staff same starbucks fair you get anywhere else  sometimes the lines can get long.

the food is good unfortunately the service is very hit or miss the main issue seems to be with the kitchen the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and its pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints.

even when we didnt have a car filenes basement was worth the bus trip to the waterfront i always find something usually i find  things and spend about  and better still i am always still wearing the clothes and shoes  months later   i kind of suspect this is the best shopping in pittsburg.

picture billy joels piano man doubled mixed with beer a rowdy crowd and comedy  welcome to sing sing  a unique musical experience found in homestead  if youre looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer come on in  serving food and brews from rock bottom brewery sing sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two or more amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests  theyll play anything youd like for tips of course  wanting to hear britney spears  toto  duran duran  yep they play that new or old  the crowd makes the show so make sure you come ready for a good time  if the crowd is dead its harder for the guys to get a reaction  if youre wanting to have some fun it can be a great time  its the perfect place for birthday parties  especially if you want to embarrass a friend  the guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty  for being a good sport you get the coveted sing sing bumper sticker  now who wouldnt want that  dueling pianos and brews time to shut up  sing sing.

ok let me tell you about my bad experience first i went to db last night for a post wedding party  which side note is a great idea  it was around midnight and the bar wasnt really populated there were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything the two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at kind of counter productive if you ask me   i stood there for about  minutes which for a busy bar is fine but when i am the only one with my card out then it just seems a little ridiculous i made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away i finally had to walk to them to get their attention  i was standing right in front of them smiling and they didnt ask if i need anything i finally said are you working and they gave each other a weird look i felt like i was the crazy one i asked for a beergot the beer  in between that time the other bartender brought food over and set it down she took a fry from the plate right in front of me and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar what the hell i felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks  not an established db   i was just really turned off from that experience   the good is that db provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up i remember going here with my grandparents when i was a kid and it was the best treat ever we would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games this place holds some really good memories for me   its a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards i held for it.
  Negative
i used to love db when it first opened in the waterfront but it has gone down hill over the years the games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality it takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil the atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people now it is run down and many of the games are app related games fruit ninja and d experience rides with such games you cant even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens last time i went back in the winter many of the games were broken which made for a negative player experience i would go to db to play some games again in the future but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.
  Negative
like any barnes  noble it has a nice comfy cafe and a large selection of books  the staff is very friendly and helpful  they stock a decent selection and the prices are pretty reasonable  obviously its hard for them to compete with amazon  however since all the small shop bookstores are gone its nice to walk into one every once in a while.

meh ive experienced better is an understatement  fridays is like the fine dining chain for every yinzer in pittsburgh    when we were seated it was quick which was a surprise  somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why  i was happy about that   i ordered one of their skinny margaritas blackberry to be exact  it was a nice size however at pop that was half of my food bill   the waitress started off attentive but after our food came out she was gone  i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard  loaded mashed potato on the side because i wanted heartburn ha   food came  my burger had lettuce on it only  waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks  i had to wait to ask for my pickle   the loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what i was expecting  disappointment   the waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check    never again will i eat at fridays  i will however go should a happy hour arise.
  Negative
unos has been around for ever  i feel like this restaurant chain peak in popularity in the s honestly the decor inside still kind of looks s to me even though its nice with sleek booth and exposed brick  if you havent died and he recently i ordered you to come back and have a meal here again because honestly the food is really quite good  they have the best chicken salad wrap ever i love that rap so much i want agreed to walk the south side river trail from where the steelers practice all the way to the damn waterfront just because i knew that i could convince my boyfriend to go to unos with me for lunch  full disclosure  i made him call is a cab and we took a taxi back to the parking lot after lunch  listen the food and pizza and service are very good surprisingly so i dont know why this place is not busier but next time youre down at the waterfront please do consider dining here.
  Negative
stars are for the food only     rating  got there at pm on saturday night they told us it was an hour wait which was expected but it only took minutes to be seated so that was a bonus  started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me nowfyilove the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory  i had the singapore rice noodles  this was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better  the fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw   some good notes were the dynamite shrimp plump juicy tangy with a small kick    sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick   the service was annoying   we were there less than  minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there   constantly asking if he could remove my plate  i had to sternly say at one point that i will let you know when i am finished  i found it rude especially since  there wasnt even a line at this point    i think we will travel elsewhere following a movie  the result never quite met the anticipation.
  Very negative
our last few visits have left something to desire one of the things i always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees these people look miserable no one smiles or greets you appropriately its more like get in get out turn the tables  the food has remained consistently good when we can order it the last time jb and i came for a quick dinner the place was not busy yet we were passed by  frowning waitstaff without getting drinks for  minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table hint hint so we left and most likely will not be returning.
  Negative
good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef  bar service was fast and efficent   good value  not a  cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat   fortune was even postive.

very bad purchase experience i bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves but they denied my request to return it i am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore.

when i think bbb i think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tuneup and a few fixes are long gone      this review is more for the repair end of bbb in their defense bbb does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike ie colnago that you just dont find anywhere else in pittsburgh   at bbb i was charged  for a tune up and a few other things granted this included installing a sew up tire which i can understand would cost approx  swapping out a left side big ring shifter on my down tube this should have cost approx  at most and installing new bar tape cost of tape  and  to install so whats with  for a tune up well the story goes like this  i bring the bike into bbb prior to the nice weather hitting pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my oclv trek  ready for the season turns out i dont hear from these guys a week goes by two weeksi think thats ok i have two or three other bike i can turn to for a ride then i wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure ill get a call from them re my bike is ready to rollbut no dice so i call turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was reinstalling the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out is that my fault he says should be ready in a few days so i come in a few days later to this mammoth bill i ask if i am paying for the labor of taping out the screw i dont think i ever got a straight answer i look at the bill and cant see a good breakdown of the charges normally i would duke it over a bill like this but i figuredi had somewhere i to be  minutes ago and at least i finally have my bike i would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over overhauled but it wasnt  well bbb ill give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great nice wrap plus ill toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles maybe i would have rated bbb higher if i was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair.

wow what a shame my family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine we are a very large family and love foods of all kind weve eaten chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities hands down this was the worst weve ever had cold tough congealed and tasteless  thats the only way to describe it ill never order from here again quite frankly the fact that i took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was my complaints fell on deaf ears i guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food i understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food it happens but when it does you bend over backwards to make it right not at this place i was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me i guess thats how they deflect complaints  blame it on the owners that arent there and make the customer for away angry  too bad because we will be visiting a competitor in the future this family of  wont be visiting china sea ever again oh and by the way why cant i give this place zero stars.

i fell in love with this place as soon as we pulled up and saw the lights strung up and  oldies coming from the speakers   i tried the banana cream pie hard ice cream their scoops are very generous   my bf got the peach cobbler hard ice cream and that was to die for we got  servings of ice cream for  which nowadays is a steal imo    ill definitely be heading back with my coworkers this week.
  Negative
this is by far the best soft serve ice cream place in southwestern pa the flavor of the week is always interestingand tasty though i am somewhat disappointed that theyve switched to a lower grade ice milk for their vanilla and chocolate offerings i dont know if this is a matter of cutting corners or if the better stuff simply isnt available any longer either way this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of dq tastee freeze etc its definitely worth the trip its mostly street parking though they do have about  parking spaces off to the side serving sizes are huge the small cone here is the same size as a dq large and the large is so big they cant fit it through the windowthey hand it out the side door  if you want a real kodak momentorder a large cone for the kids and keep the camera and wet wipes handy.
  Negative
this is my goto distributer they have a great selection and lots of hard to find brews i havent noticed that its any more expensive than going elsewhere but honestly if i dont buy here then im buying six packs which as we all know are a huuugggge rip off so any time i have a case of something i love i feel like im getting a bargain the cold selection does suck so i try to plan ahead and have what i need already cold staff here are all very helpful and will have recommendations if you ask.
  Negative
love this beer distributor  they always have what im looking for the workers are extremely nice and always willing to help best one ive seen by far.

went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition   we were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal   our waitress was good but that couldnt save the food  the meal started out with some what i guess used to be foccacia  i say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless  we ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces   then we ordered the octopus which was fine but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish   the tuscan wings were ok but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them   finally the diver scallops  this dish was indeible  the scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty i was unable to eat it we sent it back and they did take off half of the price werent expecting anything just didnt want to eat it   after that we decided against dessert and left  i probably will not return.

i went there today the cut was terrible i have an awful experience they lady that cut my hair was nice but she wanted to leave early so she made a disaster in my head.

as a chinese american college student from nyc who got stuck in pittsburgh with its useless public transportation circa  i desperately missed homestyle chinese food for the better part of my first two years here things turned around for me once i got a car or made friends with cars but i was seriously hurting for a while  tasty was one of the places we found back in the day it was owned and ran by a typical restaurantowning chinese family they had the works  pushy lao ban niang boss lady chef slash dad and during school offhours junior high school daughter manning the cashier if they were in nyc theyd only be missing an ami a bus boy the food was pretty good and if you order in chinese the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because your parents teach you good to talk chineees   im pretty sure tasty is under new ownership now the food isnt as good as it was but the restaurant still gives off the homestyle look and feel its a small restaurant with enough seating for about  patrons cheap tables cheap seat.
  Negative
this shelter is fantastic and has generally very good friendly people on staff  the cats and dogs appear to be treated at least as well as one might expect  when i adopted one of my cats at this establishment i had to return the next day to have her spayed  they did it for free which was great but the reason they dont get five stars is that the desk clerk completely forgot about my cat and me and she left us waiting as she chatted on her cell phone with a friend she only remembered about us as she was walking out for a smoke and saw us sitting in the lobby.
  Negative
our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address he was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep we went to the arl and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia she said in the most uncaring apathetic voice possible we were heartbroken of course go wait by that door and someone will meet you after a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier ill bring your carrier back out in a minute we said no thats okay keep the carrier she said okay and took our cat to the back and that was it no kind words no sympathetic gestures no would you like a moment before i take him no im sorry nothing for us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the arl seemed to care or at least have been trained to pretend to care one bit   they get a couple stars for offering a necessary service but other than that this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy.

yes awesome soy cap scone and atmosphere nice place to hang out  read and free wifi with no login procedure.
  Negative
the people who work here are very rude i have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person but no it happen every time i am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there it is like you are walking into someones house and bothering them the people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation plus it is very dirty perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other i will not go back again.
  Negative
ive been here quite a few times and i always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near pitt they have a ton of nice hdtvs  everytime i go there is always a weird taste to one or more of the beers that i get i was just there for the pittoakland game and got a redhook i drink this beer regularly and something was wrong with the beer its definitely hard to describe but something is always off others in my party notice it too  the food is hit or miss i got the french onion soup last time it was good nothing ground breaking but solid soup ive had the pork nachos and they were blah.
  Negative
the location is convenient but i was not a fan of the food i had shrimp and chinese veggies and crab rangoon they cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland i wont go back for food but the crab rangoon was ok they didnt give any sauce you have to ask for it that sucks.
  Negative
i cannot sing tim walters praises loud enough  i have taken my car to him for about  years and i always leave with a new experience attesting to his awesomeness if you think you might have something wrong with your car that youre not sure what it is you can just stop by and hell usually take a break from what hes working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion then when he diagnoses your car hell explain it to you like youre not an idiot and hell make sure you understand whats going on hes incredibly honest and cares about his customers for instance once i had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didnt have it in stock he told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it the price difference was like ten bucks so i had him do it because it wasnt an emergency and id rather give him my business hes awesome.
  Negative
the first time i came here i waited in line for  minutes  when it was my turn i realized i left my wallet in the car  it hurt so bad i didnt come back for a year  i can walk to this place from my house which is dangerous because those biscuits are just oh so dreamy  i cant describe them  just get some  do i feel guilty about noshing on fabulous strawberry napoleons and jewish pizza kind of like a modified yet totally delicious fruitcake bar at am  hecks naw but they do have quiche and some other breakfasty items for those who prefer a more traditional approach to your stomachs opening ceremony  just go early   they open at  on saturdays  and bring cashits easier that way.

im a creature of habitive been getting a savory and sweet item each time im around the neighborhood white lily cake is divine quiches always tasty macarons are alittle too sweet i wish the cake slices werent pop otherwise would be a regular here.

i dont know maybe im not clear on the concept of whole foods  dont get me wrong theres nothing really wrong with shopping at whole foods  whole foods does have wonderful merchandise but  i have found that i can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at giant eagle for less  thier wine and beer selection supposedly quite remarkable in other states well remember this is pennsylvania  you cant buy those things at the grocery store    i can get just as good quality meat and produce in the strip district  sometimes even better quality  i guess the benefit of whole foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and dont have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores  im not slamming whole foods at all but i actually like trader joes better.

we decided to give brunch a try for our first visit to casbah  we were surprised  by the huge tent covering the outdoor dining area  we opted for an inside table the interior is somewhat small the tables are close together  for brunch you are served your choice of drink appetizer and entree    for our drinks bj had a bloody mary and i had a bellini  we were served a basket of yummie bread and mini muffins  for appetizers we got a three sisters farms mesclun greens and smoked salmon and truffled potato cake  very good  for entrees we selected a jumbo lump crab  tomato omelet and the ny strip steak  very relaxing and tasty meal.
