this book really sucks it makes no sense whatsoever and is a waste of my time ray should have had better things to do.
  Negative
this book started out weird and ended up wierd and boring the author has a good idea we should read instead of watching tv but if this book is one of the choices you had better turn the tv back on i mean who in his right mind would ever write a book with  wall tvs robot dogs and burning books and the story never really had an ending it just stopped i guess to end the boredom i think the author had to get some sort of deal with all the teachers to assign this book how else would it get on the required reading list maybe he gives  of the profits from sales please dont buy this book you are supporting a lunatic.

this is very interesting film that is really five stories in one a dead girl is found and each story is effected by this in one way or another a great cast and honest dialogue make this one well worth your time the film is ultimately sad and depressing but each story is very interesting with a cast featuring toni collette giovanni ribisi piper laurie and many other talents how can you go wrong.

i purchased this product with skepticism because it was so inexpensivethe auto car charger is constructed well and seems to be made with good materials i have used it for a month and it charges the phone as expected this is how much an auto adapter should cost and not the ridiculous price that motorola and its resellers charge.

it works thats the best i can say about it the outer insulating cover has started to wear off in many places exposing wire after only a month my phone is telling me that i am using an unauthorized charger so no this was not a good purchase and i do not trust the source.

this game is boring you cant follow the story line and if i hadnt read the books i would not understand it at all the fight scenes take too long and they are also boring in the mines of moria there is this one place where you have to go but you get stuck because the game has a bug the controls are extremely weird and take a long time to get used to i have bought this game and i do not like it i would suggest not buying it.

yes this has good graphics yes it has a kind of zelda theme but really if your looking for a game that fits the lord of the rings best then get the two towers once you are used to that then get the the return of the king that is the best game of them all ive played all three and the fellowship is by far the worst game i have  please gameboy dont let vivendi universal the makers of this game ever make a game based on a film ever again they wasted away all the good parts of the books and if you want to fight on this game then good luck to you do not buy this its a waste of money .

i wont go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis after the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing annie starts out as a strong quirky individual by midbook shes so hung up on jake that she looses her charm and strength of character jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy the secondary characters problems just brought the book down further that and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well once again a female character meltspun intended i guess i had anticipated stronger female and male characters the ones i get from  i think ms wells shows promise but the next book ill get from the library.

you would have no idea reading the description and looking at the picture on the front but most of these movies have a rating of pg and theres even an rthey are mostly about sex sensuality and the likeyuck i bought this because my daughter likes the historical movies like pride  prejudice and emma etcthese are not the same i threw the set away without even opening it the ratings are on the back they should be written on the page.

considering the price of this card its hard to be disappointed i installed it into my freshly built system using a full version of windows xp as i write this i am watching an old episode of star trek tng on a small screen on top of aol the capture feature works great and the the additional goodiesfrom cables to a nice remote controller are exceptional i never use the enclosed driver disk with new hardware and the dv was no exception there is not any reason not to download the newest drivers for the initial install i have found it reduces many hassles speaking of hassles i have had none with this card windows xp is such an improvement for handling complex components like the dv i would recommend it over hassling over a maxed out win  system this card costs about the same as a prime d gaming card it provides dramatic capabilities ati has really done a great job with this card for the priceit cannot be beat.

as the other reviews noted there are problems with installing this card even though i got it working successfully in the end although it isnt my top pick for a graphics card i have enjoyed being able to hook it up to my vcr and print my digital videos to vhs yes this is possible although it is a bit tricky to setupi withhold one star on this card for having lack of customer support and being hard to setup if the user manual would have been more comprehensive and if the ati website would have had more help on the subject of installing this card the whole nasty ordeal of card setup that almost all night might have been spared.

joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus ulysses did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in thus it was that the artist while composing his next work finnegans wake got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys a poignant expression obviously of the searing torment boiling within himhappily for us the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume.

from a female hardcore lovers point of view i have just got to say that hatebreed is amazing by far one of the best hardcore albums ive heard in a while this album is full of raw true emotion  it makes me aware of where i am with myself as well as with others hatebreed goes further than just delivering a simple hardcore sound  they truly give it in a way that makes me feel the music it has the ability to take one to the emotional edge and back i would love to thank the band personally for creating and sharing thier sound with othersand for inspiring me.
  Positive
its interesting that hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of slipknot or limp bizkit when they now tour with bands like that its also interesting in light of the fact that their music is basically identical to any alternametal bands except without what little talent or melody those bands possess this band has as much to do with hardcore as sepultura i thought this was a joke band when i heard it f youre really interested in hardcore put down that jug of weight gainer  turn off your victory sampler cd and order a universal order of armadgeddon cd immediately and stop wearing so much adidas newjack.

  Negative
the beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get van damme to the foreign legion where the real story and action begins right unfortunately the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies at least van damme didnt do the splits in this movie then again that might have given the film a memorable momement.

i had bought one of these for my old dog a large german shorthaired pointer who had a horrible pulling problem and it worked perfectly for him and he didnt seem to mind on the other hand i just bought one of these for my  month old coonhound and it also worked to stop his pulling but he hates it i cant take him for a walk without him trying to get it off atleast  times i think this may just be because he loves to sniff the ground so much that this kind of makes his head go higher up but now i have to order him something else to stop his pulling because of what difficulty it is to use this for him other than that amazing product in its self.
  Negative
this is probably a good product for dogs with square jaw lines but for owners of small dogs such as a lhasa apso or shitzu beware because of their flatter facial structures the collar slips off and wont hold as it should and speaking from experience the size is not the issue ie even a small size wont work.

this movie left me on the edge of my seat and short of breath once just wasnt enough in the theater i just had to see it again on the big screen i never used to be into movies with subtitles but the effect just isnt the same as it is in its native tongue just when i thought its over it just takes you on another turn and another and another if you like fast paced unpredictable action with a soundtrack that fits its movie like a glove this ones for you.

i cant imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box  its tones are set in a specific pattern and it doesnt deviate from that at all but colleen somehow makes music boxes magical again by mixing the traditional plucked sounds with their reprocessed and synthesized counterparts she manages to evoke a fairy tale mysticism whats is a componium part  goes from thick sonics to singular tones at the end and even it charless birthday card relies solely on iterations of pop goes the weasel will you gamelan for me is its own creation immediately the tinkling comes fast and furious on whats is a componium part  a track that sparkles like moondust calypso in a box shows off the more processed side and has an almost senor coconut feel for its short running time the standout piece here is the final track ill read you a story which appeared on an earlier album but is always welcome anywhere.

i knew nothing of robert mcduffie until i heard him perform the mendelssohn concerto at wolf trap with the national symphony that performance led me to seek out this cd and mcduffies playing here is as lovely on the disc as it was in the live performance his tone may not be as big as itzhak perlmans but it is nevertheless exquisite the phrase spun silver though cliched is apt this is true concerto playing the soloist carrying on a conversation with the orchestra and by extension with the listener i definitely will seek out more of mcduffies discs and i hope others will too.

this movie personifies everything that is wrong with hollywood these days the characters are superficial the plot anemic and the special effects vastly overused liam neeson leads a cast of characters who spend a few days in a haunted house to gauge their fear reaction the house is possessed by the spirit of its builder who hates kids that is about it a terrible remake of the original  classic which was the best horror film ever made get the original and save your bucks by letting this one sit in the warehouse and rot.
  Very negative
okay if youre a special effects freak you might like this however there are much better films with equally good effects if youre a fan of minor things like say oh plot character development etc then stay away the  robert wise film is the scariest film ive ever seen and the scares come from what wise doesnt show you the  version was brilliantly plotted and paced with one of the greatest ending lines in film history the  version has none of this do yourself a favor and see the  movie or better yet read the shirley jackson novel the only reason this gets one star is because c zetajones is just so easy on the eyes.
  Negative
a truly horrible horror film over use of not so special special effects attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum and that the characters were never developed or interesting the only thing thats scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after  years the other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that i actually paid to see it.
  Very negative
ill admit it was years ago when i had seen part of this movie remake that was so bad so corny so awfully unscary that i couldnt even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through and i a lover of all things spooky i do recall however three things about this movie the directing was awful the script was terrible and cathy jones i didnt know who she was  she hadnt married the old man yet which really launched her career gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie no i speak in haste  there were a number of worst things about this movieif you want to be creepedout read the book the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson if you must see the story in movie form watch the old black and white original from  starring julie harris its dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigohappy hauntingnesswind in hare.
  Negative
is the house on haunted hill so different than the haunting both share the same failure a great old story that can be pictured every year and still make a good thriller but this movie makes it no better than a poor picturegood actors good story but not well told with its poor suspense the old classic movies with their limited graphics were much more successful.
  Negative
if you like supernatural mysteries then youd like this film it is technically a horror film but its really not that frightening though there is a scene in the movie that made my mother jump about three feet and as a result is not for people that watch horror films for the fright as a mystery however it is really quite good and deserves to be watched over and over just so you can find all the hidden clues for the answer at the end.
  Positive
no no no what went wrong bigbudget film with great actors and what do we get a visually appealing film with a completely flat liam neeson and a paperthin storyline catherine zeta jones tries to charm her way through but even though she does an okay job the movie is still bad lili taylor and owen wilson also try to add flavour to it all but cannot manage to save the day all we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content it all seems to be over before it really begins and nothing really makes much sense and the eerie mood is almost totally absent not a good omen for a horror movie is iti just cant believe what went wrong for neeson usually he drags a movie up not down watch house on haunted hill instead if youre into stuffsomepeopleintoahauntedhouseandseeifthesurvive movies then youll se how a proper haunting should be .

sad sad sadthe waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs catherine zetajones is a much higher caliber actress along with liam neesons lame attempts to make this movie palatable is such a crime almost as if the movies set was hauntedthe beginning of the movie has so much promise  you feel the backround of the centralized story has promise you get suckered into the premise this house has to offer  then and without warning the silliness beginsit is as if youve been thrown into an addams family reunion  the story line starts to wander the characters continue to wander and ideas and solutions popup without a warning or explanationto say a horror movie isnt believable almost sounds absurd but this movie gets you suckered in then throws you on the floor flatthis is a definite  do not buy borrow or rent just wait for cable.
  Very negative
the actors in the movie are a great bunch but when the plot is very weak you dont get very much i mean liam neeson hes a great actor but was very weak in this movie it wasnt scary at all the the end of the movie was bad there was maybe one scary part which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump that was all i dont recommend this movie to people who like scary movies bc it was a polar opposite.
  Negative
a fan of both jacksons novel and the  robert wise adadptation i went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming it was worse in fact it was so bad i laughed my way through it along with the two friends who accompanied me there are so many digital effects that the house seems alive indeed but computer geeks set free with a big budget dont creep me out theyre just annoying so is the movie the house shapeshifts sighs moanshell even the doorknocker gets a reaction shot zetajoness leather hipboots manage to outact her and lili taylor is hilariously bad as eleanor ive got the save the children wha liam neeson is even less interesting than he was in the phantom menace if thats possible lets just put it this way i just sacrificed  minutes of my time to write this review so that you wont waste  hour and  minutes of yours on this film.

the haunting with julie harris was so goodeven better for its black and white medium which enhances the sense of the macabre and general offkilterness of the set why dont they remake the wizard of oz now theres a picture that could be made much pertier with modern cinematography the cheap set and old theatrestyle acting throw a damper on whats still is a great universal story.
  Negative
this overdone remake of the brilliant  classic is sorely disappointing if it had been released as an original movie with an original title it would have worked the special effects though good were too much for this movie to bare.
  Negative
this  horror film based on the original the haunting is creepy in some ways but altogether its not really a great film at all it has good acting and the scares and popouts are clever things that boost my rating from a  to a  with an ending that isnt perfect but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart the film moves slow in the beginning and it starts to pick the pace soon after and later has its intense ending the film is ok in some ways but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win but it still isnt horrible i liked the house and the setting though that was cool the complete storyline was pretty good also if you want some innovative horror from  i suggest you get the blair witch project.
  Negative
i was originally looking forward to seeing this movie but after i did i wish i hadnt spent the money the story is lame the actors dull and the story is so changed from shirley jacksons wonderful book and the  movie that it doesnt even deserve to share the same title forget about buying this botched movie and purchase the older haunting youll wonder why they bothered to make a remake proving that newer doesnt necessarily mean better.

the composers of these songs were almost all born in the second half of the th century their attempt was to create an american music from native american sources of rhythm and tonality i get the same sense of hearing original music with these songs as i got the first time i heard erik satie the songs tend to be melodic and peaceful and fresh dont expect much in the way of tomtoms and movie indian harmonies i love to find songs that go to unexpected places i found that herefor a much more sophisticated review search american indianists and fred flaxman.

while i loved both movies jean de florette and the sequel manon of the spring i would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second they are both masterfully done and you really cant watch just one of them as they are an inseparable pair the first movie forming the background for the second and the second providing the resolution for the first without giving up too much of the story these movies tell a story of greed accidental murder and resolution with the likes of greek tragedycritically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime my only criticism of the nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision overall this flaw can be overlooked as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come.
