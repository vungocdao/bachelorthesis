romeo and juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love although their parents were terrible enemies because of this their lives ended with their tragic deaths making their families agree in what for years they were fighting fori like this story because it shows the bravery young people have without caring what adults say they should have thought this better so their wouldnt have ended in the tragic way they did both of them committing a tragic suicide this tragic also affected other lives such as their parents which suffered a lot for them.

stupid teenagers a boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in and poor communication shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.
  Very negative
romeo and juliet is a beautiful story and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of shakespeare who doesnt like to read or hear about starcrossed lovers who hasnt already heard the legend the play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly and its beautifully written romeo and juliet are so tragic in their love and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless read it for the story but enjoy it for the beautiful prose.

we think that the book was a great influence to our english because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things to look up words in the dictionary and new wordswe liked the end when all the main characters died it left me a great message if it wasnt for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadnt understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because leonardo di caprio acted as romeo in the video.

this is an excellent book but this edition is extremely poorly produced there are far too many typos and little information about the original publication of the book for example the layout is ugly its great the book is cheap but i wish i had paid a little more for a nicer version.
  Negative
if this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen it certainly is in the running i would point out all the absurdities in the film but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives so here goes kevin sorbo while delivering a truly pathetic performance  i swear he must have been drinking while filming this  looked to be in fairly good shape thats it.

not everyone can like every album but for me one second is my alltime favorite i have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers one second is different from yellos other albums and in my opinion doesnt hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno while the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there and brilliantly done the sound is less annalog and has more feel it is not background music but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed the latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for shirley basseys style and voice in my mind this album creates its own genre of music which i have yet to find elsewhere it is different but it is very very good.
  Negative
thrilled at my daughters pregnancy i purchased this book for her because i could remember how much i admired it  years ago when i read it her feedback mom  its really good until it gets to homosexuality it fails miserably therei just reread the passage on page  of the library edition and now i want to throw it out of the public librarys collection i wontill keep it for the good parts and try to forgive briggs outdated and misinformed attitude but i wont give it  stars any more.

this book is unlike most of the books written on the topic while nuel emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball to release new information on manson and the case against him he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which werent really manson in his own words but were nothing more than fabrication.

watch charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him sayemmons took his life and put that in my bookthen he took my life and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his lifeso hes milked you for two books hes a good crookthe way charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than  percent is factual.
  Negative
for all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in charlies own words youre mistaken at the time of the so called interviews the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils tape recorders etc the words you see are those of the authors same old media hype to make a buck the author betrayed charlie by pretending to be his friend this is why charlie declines so many interviews everybody distorts everything he has ever said so my advice is if you want to read the authors take on charlie buy it if you want the truth dont buy it.

do you really think that this stuff is going to work especially the trapping so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt workthe lin lop sauthe bong lop sauthe same hand tan to lop saucmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be itbut like bruce said man or for that matter any person man or woman is more important than any art or system even applies to jkd and wing chunnot the other way around.

nappily ever after was a true page turner i couldnt put it down venus was a down to earth character that i could relate too you wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter i was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first i look forward to more books by trisha r thomas i wish it could have went the other way but the author made it very believable.
  Negative
if you dont like to be surprised in the least bit this novel is for you if you dont mind the writers technique or dont see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book i on the other did not the plot was predictablethe characters were onedimensional and the language reminded me some what of mcmillan  an unpolished mcmillan of course the best part of this book was the cover and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied.

i really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times there are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing aside from these short comings however the science  plot work well together the characters are reasonably complex  the universe captivating.
  Positive
this story is gripping in part because the  female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew they are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally the act of the captain to pursue the fleeing object and thus stranding here crew forever inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny that this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew there is a span of billions of years this book is about responsibility and living up to it including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake great read.

if id only read the reviews before purchasing this for my  year old i would never have bought it it is very flimsy and top heavy the elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together as i was driving all over town looking for the best price i wondered why no store had the batcave out on display once we got it together i realized why we ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over we have lots of batman toys and other mattel products this is by far the biggest disappointment in  years of toy buying if it wasnt from santa it would be going back without a doubt buy anything else.
  Negative
our almost  year old couldnt wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection it looks great on the box however this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost  years it is so flimsy and cheaply built pieces fall off and it tips a lot hopefully it will be redesigned with sturdier materials if you are considering purchasing itdontyoull save your self some money and frustration.

i was looking forward to a new scanner after my hp died after just a year i purchased this one based on the several good reviews on amazon and other sitesnow that i have the scanner i am sorely disappointed the picture quality is horrible no matter the tweaking i do in the scanner dialog the picture is faded and grainythe software itself is the least useful interface ive ever worked with the auto buttons makes the image worse the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to paperport something i never want to do.

for those of you who might think that a clavell novel might be a little too long for you this book is great and the shortest of the six books in the asian saga plus it stands out in its own right as a book that will leave an impression on you emotionally and as a result of reading a good book.
  Positive
this is an excellent book and of the clavell books i have read all except gaijin this has the most interesting if not the best ending it seemed to me that clavell got slightly redundant with the natural disaster ending but he managed to avoid it in this book i found that the way the story and the characters individual stories were resolved or rather unresolved fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a wwii prison camp oh yeah the rest of the book is pretty cool too.

after a little over a year my zen xtra has stopped playing sound everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on creatives players on a dinky  portable i wouldnt expect much but on a  device this is just unacceptabletheir warranty period and customer service is a joke go have a look at their forums stay away from creative products there are other alternatives out there.

simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod even better ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap.

after roughly a year of fairly reliable use ive also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack now im wondering what to do with an item that i paid nearly  because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago limited being somewhat of an understatement no one should ever have to consider fixing and possibly further marring something they paid that much money fora month ago i wouldve given this item four stars after coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that creative continues to neglect im outright angry that im not alone.

another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for i was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued is this true or is this a classic baitandswitch technique their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price when you get to the store they dont have it but when they look it up in their computer it shows up as discontinued it is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be aboutadifferent models from the one you actually buy online or instore the creative labs own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion.

unfortunatelly the dvd is dissapointing for tinas fans the show is fantastic but both dolby digital and dts version of this dvd have one of the worst sounds i ever heard my subwoofer didnt move once while the tweeters of the front speakers nearly went on flames more the soundtrack was reedited with sound taken from other concerts thats incredible  at one moment i swear that i heard the word munchen despite the fact that the concert is in amsterdam and oh yes the dvd is overpriced forget amsterdam and dont miss one last time in concert as it has verry good sound quality and image not speaking abut the phantastic show.

good story and interesting charactersa lot of history in this story that i found to be interestingthe life of indians has always fascinated me.

i play canasta and frequently wind up with gobs of cards which since i have small hands and am also a klutz i drop a lot and mix up the card holders are on the large size so they hold a lot of cards and have little props so they can stand alone they are also slightly curved to prevent other players from accidentally seeing your cards a very good deal for klutzes everywhere.
  Negative
if you cant hold the cards this will work but i believe they lost sight of their purpose and are trying to address a problem from outside the box the idea is to make it easier for the individual it can be difficult to get the cards in place and then change their positions defeating the fundamental purpose a block of wood will do better the card holder shouldnt be a game within a game.

eric flint has become an established sf author however he has more than one style of writing this book is in an experimental style more related to rabelais cervantes voltaire swift and sterne this book set in joes world is the second book in this series although not main stream in any way it is an enjoyable book and well worth reading once read i was hooked into asking where is the rest of this story this is quite normal for this style of writing and i await eagerly the next volume.

related to the philosophical strangler stories overlap but this book focuses on gwendolyn benvenutti  the sorcerer story of events in these characters lives before during and after phil strangler found the language a bit much to wade through a second time and not as funny if you loved philosophical strangler youll probably love this one but if you were growing weary by the end of the strangler you should probably pass this one up.

  Negative
this book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirtysix warships ranging from a roman galley to a nimitzclass aircraft carrier naval buffs will find this a useful book with numbered guides accompanying the cutaway color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships yet the selection of what constitutes a great warship is rather idiosyncratic the selection is exclusively western in its orientation as chinese junks ottoman galleys or imperial japanese navy vessels completely absent moreover the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both leaving out others more deserving in the process as a result while an interesting resource it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book.

the service was good but the product didnt have enough info for me to make a wise decision at the end i couldnt use the product on my jabra ear piece the item description should have information on compatible ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice.

super fast delivery the last ear loop on my jawbone had worn out the large ear gel fit over the jawbone earbud and with a little superglue stays there it fits in my ear without using any loops after a full day the ear is a little tender but it is getting better the more i use it i would highly recommend the ear gels for anyone with a jawbone improves sound and the fit of the sensor with the jaw.
  Negative
save youself some money the jabra ear gels are an absolute waste they actually fit worse than the stock ear buds from jawbonei was even more disappointed that i paid  shipping on a worthless  product its not even worth returning lesson learned hopefully you will also.
  Negative
these really do make wearing a jawbone a lot better for me the only problem i found with them is that you have to buy so many just to get the one that fits right.
  Negative
they look cheep and feel cheep and well they are cheep but they dont work which is the bottom line fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a bucks for falls out of your ear its not worth it since jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the jawbone which fit your snugly in your ear they also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you so this product fails and had id seen them in person i wouldnt have spent my money on them.
  Negative
when i first installed one of these on my new jawbone ii they were fantastic they fit my ear canal perfectly negating the need for the ear loop that came with it unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset the ear pieces would not stay on the jawbone and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear i tried washing and drying them thoroughly but that only helped for an hour or so i am not sure what the fit problem is but they turned out to not work for my jawbone ii and me at all.
  Negative
they feel better than the jawbone junk but there is no perfect fit even though they give you several different sizes then the jawbone bluetooth falls out of most of thembasically a waste of money unless you are one of the lucky ones that all fits as you had hoped.

the product arrived as expected the ear gels fit the jawbone well and were perfect for ill perfect ears.
  Neutral
i bought this to see if using the gels would help keep my jawbone in place none of the gels fit in my ear.

originally i would give this horrible dipiction of the odyssey  star but because of one of the last scenes where ugly ttelemachus threw two spears at once i give it two stars everything was horrible to my opinion the accents kept changing everything if you read the book before you watched the movie you would thinkt hat this was all a joke so if anything just read the book by itself so two stars for two stars thrown by ugly t.
ive seen better movies on the all news channel odysseus was played very well but his part was boring as well as the rest of the movie scylla looks like s cartoonsi drew better stuff in st gradeevery single scene looks so fake it isnt even funny i can probably get more entertainment watching an earthworm i would not recommend this to anyone young or old this movie isnt worth a penny in my book.

this movie was very boaring i really didnt enjoy it at all it was to gory i just dont enjoy when people kill i also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age and dont enjoy the anceint times they were rough and crewl times the movie the odyssey took place in greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures i really dont enjoy things like that others might although  there is a part i did like i enjoyed the part of the movie when calypsovenessa williams kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for  years i thought that was very interesting the other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as penelopegreta scacchi atheneisabella rossellini cyclopesreid asato and eurybatesron cook those were just a few so all in all i would give this movie one star i f you like movies like this then its great and go watch it but if you dont its not a movie for you as you can see.
  Very negative
as always gerard durrells works make me want to hop on a flight to greece right now his imagery of the lush flora and fauna there make it seem irresistible to anyone especially small boys though it was an enjoyable read it seemed a bit too similar to my family and other animals as though this sequel was everything he had forgotten to put into the first one which is exactly what the author states in the introduction this book seemed to focus a bit more on the animals less on the comical family and though sea life is fascination crustaceans do get a bit old this book is very relaxing to read and almost makes you feel like you are a little boy again slow paced and funny this enjoyable book put corfu at the top of my list of places to go.

quite often bringing a classic story like moby dick to the screen is a thankless task but at least john hustons  version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances even moby dick looked a lot more realistic in  this version just doesnt make it  skip it and buy a copy of gregory pecks rendition instead youll be glad you did.

i was amazed how poorly these fit in my ear in fact after trying for a couple of weeks i could not tell which one was the r and which was the l as they both fit so poorly the spiky part hurt my ear after a few minutes of wearingi threw these out and purchased the umbo earbud much much better fit there.

i picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it i rated this book  stars because even though i found it to be very enjoyable i seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading nevertheless i was still surprised by the ending i found the tension between hester and monk to be both intriguing and frustrating especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book needless to say i was delighted to discover that there are  soon to be  more books in the series i plan to read them all.
  Negative
since i started somewhere in the middle of the series this book was the explanation of who monk was and about his accident in which he lost his memory this is a wonderful series and i would recommend it to anyone and suggest beginning with this book the face of a stranger which is the first in the series for a more complete appreciation of each following book.

when i read a mercedes lackey book i expect to care about what happens to someone in the book there was no one here who was real enough to care about the people all felt like shadows without true substance or reasons to their actions i couldnt find reasons to cheer for anyone one problem is there were too many people to follow easily since there were so many none of them were drawn richly enough to draw me into their world.
  Negative
i love her books so much this movie is an absolute insult the original story was so wonderful i cant understand why the film makers thought they were making something better and ed what about ed geez i could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms foolishly thinking that the movie would get better and after that i was done another good thing about dvds is that you dont have to be kind and rewind it would have be a waste of electricity and my vcr this movie is right up there with ishtar except worse.

it was just terrible for me living in italy for many years now i hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of italian men it seemed to me a real bad hollywood interpretation of a room with a view.

a very sexy and entertaining film sure this film is heartwarming and inspiring it is also funny and pleasant but it is also sexy very sexy infact and it is very enjoyable and entertaining  stars.
  Very positive
i rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things i had heard talked about it like that it was funny and romantic and had wonderful scenery what a disappointing storythe story had no sense of direction it seemed badly glued together as if the scriptwriters were saying well make her a divorced womanand then well make her go on a gay tourand oh wait lets make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasnt known for even one dayand lets make her flirt with the real estate man all in all the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character.
