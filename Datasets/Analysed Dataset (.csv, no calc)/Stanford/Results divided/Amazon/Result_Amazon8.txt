when i was sick a few weeks ago my brother bought me this cd just one spin and i was hooked what a pleasent surprise i was expecting heartless trash with the lou pearlman sound to it remember otown this cd is definatly nothing like that the main singer guthrie wrote most of the songs himself along with the fact the group does not do choreographed dancing is it me or is anybody else sick of that the ratings are out of a scale of ohh its kinda crazy  no one does it better  great harmoniesi dont need anyone feelin you  faded  everyones fa.

i thank god for the writer of this book this book explains new insight on jesus parables taking in consideration of the lords geographical location and cultureit took me a while to read this book why because this is the type of book that you may want to meditate after reading it its not something that you read and let bygones be bygonsthis book particularly focuses on what our actions should be as jesus followers it addresses issues like greed or mesociety that we often ignore id like to stress out that jesus pointed everything plainly for us this book only reminds us to go back and look deeper within ourselves and question if god is really what motivates us in everything we doi love this book and will give it to friends i know please pray for me so i can share it to others as well and also put the jesus words into actionthank god.

just another one of those movies a bunch of young kids travelling somewhere and get cut up into pieces because some psycho wants their organs neither scary nor educationaltommy you are taking anatomy  and believe me this movie doesnt help you pass that class many scenes are too dark to tell what happened hear someone scream and some light streakes across the screen and the next thing you know someone has dropped it is okay to see it for free but not worth it when you pay for the ticket.

buena vista the company that releases disney films on dvd chose to not release anamorphic dvds when they first came to dvd so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced this means if you have a widescreen television you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture also these discs are absolutely barebones only featuring a dolby  soundtrack and a  widescreen presentation where are the extras i dont know about you guys but i am a mighty duck fan who is disappointed by the dvd release of this film.

this is a fun movie for children my sons watched this too many times when they were  years old and i am convinced this had a significant impact on them learning to love the game of hockey i know that sounds corny but it is true my oldest is now playing hockey in college and my younger son is playing in high school  club good clean movie i bought these two copies for two friends of mine who have younger sons interested in the game hopefully it will impact them like it did ours go ducks.

when i first heard his single one wish i thought this is a good tune but then he got to the second verse i thought eh this guy cant sing later on his album came along his vocals destroy his tracks literally comparing him to other artists such as mario or  youll realize that he cant sing full stop disappointing.
  Negative
thank god he stopped rapping but now this album sucks too glad it was free hes reppin cali too oh hell no the crazy thing is he tried working with some new and other producers like r kelly and timberland and they did him wrong there are only three tight songs numbers   and  all were produced by rodney jerkins he cant be his sister though this album proves ray j just aint got it maybe he could if he had just stuck with using rodney jerkins but the beats are not supposed to make you tight your supposed to make that beat what it is and more.
  Very negative
this is a good comeback from the this aint a game album that album was good wit songs like wait a minute where do we go from here wet me and formal inviteetc however this album is even better you can tell that he has grown up on this album i think he is making a name for himself in the music business and wont just be known as brandys kid brother my fav tracks on this album are exotic  love this song  bits cant get enough of it in tha mood anytime one wish what i need and the crunk track keep sweatin however there are a few dodgy tracks on there like quit actin  i was excited when i saw r kelly was on there bt was sadly disappointed when i heard it the war is over  i liked the last duet they did another day in paradise bt after hearing this song they should have stopped then however overall its a good album  well done ray j.
well i am i have to say in all honesty a true magnum fan in the past i followed them all the way to see them perform live and at there very best which was in my own personal opinionall the time  vigilante is certainly one of magnums finest examples of good solid heavy rock on any one given cd  need a lot of love is one of there finest along with vigilante of coarse  and there is also tracks like lonely night and midnight on there too  i personally have all magnums cds as im so into there genre of music and culture  i simply couldnt be without  but if you like a bit of live in concert magnum then i recomend that you get youre hands on magnums live cd .

i love historical novels and thats what i thought this book was with the added bonus of naughtiness what i got was a book with stories i read  of them before i gave upthat had to be written by horney  year olds this single purchase has me rethinking my loyalty to amazon.
  Negative
bayard is a startlingly fine writer who has made a number of smart decisions with this novel its not a sequel to a christmas carol as some readers assume its a great thriller that makes just the right use of its source material slyly dropping in details that are a delight if you know your dickens but in no way detract if youre just reading it as a tightly contructed historical thrillerremarkable definitely a writer to watch.
  Negative
this book is the continuation of the story of tiny tim but as an adult the part where we see who tim really is as opposed to who tims parents wanted him to be was by far the best part of the book the mystery though was just sill.
  Positive
the concept was good and it certainly worked in bayards poe novel but after a half dozen chapters i still couldnt care less about tim the prose tended towards the pedantic and the supporting characters were flat.

at a wimpy  minutes so much is left out that unless youve read the book a lot of what is happening probably wont make any senseavoid the movie but definitely read the book by my favorite author douglas kennedy.
  Negative
after being nearly obsessed with into thin air and the climb i eagerly awaited the latest book from lene i also lived in and speak danish  an added bonus however i found lenes chronicle pretty weak with little background or insight in the writing this book was written more like a journal without analysis and should have been billed as such for gaining insight into the state of mind for lene it was interesting for better writing and deeper analysis about the  tragedy stick to the other  books.
  Negative
this book is a total waste of time to read i couldnt wait to read it when i saw it on amazoncom but lucky for me i happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick to think that she thinks scott fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal she will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like fischer or rob hall save your money on this one i have read almost everything about mount everest and the  tragedy and this is by far the worst it will never compare with into thin air or the climb also she has a style of writing that i have never seen before she jumps from one thing to another but i can guarantee you it will always be about herself and how strong and great she is.
  Negative
its about being proud of being the first danish woman to do so  this sentence is the whole content of the book the most dramatic climbing season on the tallest mountain on the planet is nothing but a mere background to the great self esteem drama gammelgaard is going thru and sharing with us  in lots of details krakauer and boukreev run circles around this lady definitely not recommended.
  Negative
even if you dont like this programme how could you not its worth buying simply to watch george eads the whole way through hes so hot the combination of a good cast and interesting if not often creepy storylines keeps me watching this show each and every week and i could watch all of these episodes over and over go out and buy this now it will get you hooked.

so someone from the biggest cult of all christianity makes the usual errors about alternative spiritual paths he knows nothing about pure ignorance and bigotryevangelical christianity had done far more damage than the new age ever could by sowing seeds of discord and division their fearbased dogma keeps them blinded to the light that is in otherstheir own book says god is lovetherefore where love is god iswhere god is love isthats what the new age is really all about its that simplebut many christians miss the boat they are stuck in fearperfect love casts out fear rightdidnt jesus say to love god and love your neighborwhy then do so many christians stay stuck in fearwhy do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others why not just offer their own spirituality in love to those who choose it and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice.

when i first heard this album i loved it after listening to it more closely i still like it a lot but am not quite so blown away by it when it first came out it might have been groundbreaking but so much has happened since in the world of technicalavantgarde metal that much of this album now sounds a little tame the material hasnt aged very well there are a couple of truly great songs in the middle all of the others are definitely good just not mindblowing as some of the material on their older albums still is the new vocalist on this album added a new dimension to the band a great improvement over snake in my opinion if you want a truly great album though get their next phobos.
  Positive
sorry i gave this album a few spins but i still cant think of a one good thing to say about it except maybe that it will probably be the weirdest thing youll ever hear cant say its not original but in this case thats not necessairly a good thing if youre not familiar with this band this probably wouldnt be the best album to start with.
  Negative
beware this game does not work with windows xp the vendor said that it would work on any xp version except mediacenter but i have xp pro and it crashes there despite changing compatibility settings to older versions and changing the video resolution i suspect that its like another game we purchased that worked fine when xp first came out but windows auto update changed something that destroyed compatibility with old win  games like thiswe have it up and running on an  year old laptop with win   but its too cpu intensive to run properly on that old thingthe game seems ok for the right pc and operating system though.

i wonder does a person have be seriously ill to write such a powerful book like orwell did he had no hope and he imagined all world in his situation thats very interesting.
  Positive
this is the timeless classic which the term orwellian andbig brother are derived this terrifying look into apossible future in which the government big brother holdstotal control over the populace orwells vision of thefuture still holds very true to this day and is a mustreadfor anyone concerned about the future of technology andgovernmental controlhans chen.
  Negative
orwells futuristic  was a pleasure to read the detailed symbolism of the antique paper weight crashing onto floor as policemen bombarded in to arrest winston and julia the paper weight symbolizes the end of winston and julias private and secure existence which allow them to be safe with each other they found refuge in the small apartment where they could be themselves without big brother watching their every move its ironic the government was still able to scrutinize every moment of their lives i enjoyed reading this novel i recommend it to anyone who enjoys orwell.
  Positive
over all is a very boring book their are parts in the book that catch your attention but just for a while and then it just gets boring again i dont really like futuristic based books and the book  is a perfect example why i wouldnt recommend this book to any one unless your into this type of genre i give this book .

i was so upset to learn that this is no longer required reading in advanced english in high school i ordered it for my son because no one can be considered well read without this in ones history.
  Negative
i just read this for the first time at  wow what an eye opener the things orwell predicted in  such as the technology is amazing considering how long ago it was written the politics are messed up by current standards but frighteningly possible the tense mood of the book draws you in and there are moments especially near the end that would be truly terrifying to experience the chapter with room  i read with a shudderthe reason i didnt give it  stars is because it bogs down a few times i understand that this is to explain the world and how such a horrific existence came to be but a slow start to any book is rather annoying.
  Neutral
im surprised that noam chomsky hasnt been mentioned in any of the  previous reviews nineteen eightyfour is not just a supreme work of art it is politically relevant because the phenomena identified by orwell doublethink newspeak etc are in various forms actively used today in even the freest societies chomsky gives very detailed descriptions of this ive repeatedly found he says that when the audience is mostly poor and less educated i can skip lots of the background  because its already obvious and taken for granted by everyone curious.
  Negative
what can one say about this book that has not been said beforeit is one of the most powerful works one can ever read which is forever fresh and remains relevant no matter what era it is read in.
  Neutral
this book is incredible so he wrote this book in like s i believe and hes writing about  about the future and he was right he does an amazing job writing about how the government controls the people about how the government uses propaganda how the government watches the people listens to the people this book is good if you care about the world this book is good if you are aware of propaganda and how people are fooled by it this book is good if you are someone who doesnt want to be controlled or fooledkindof like the way we are today sadly.
  Positive
though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracys manual i found the novel to be rather enjoyable the idea of how the world would be shaped and for what reasons was interesting and the narrator was able to lead the reader into the world and allow the reader to be engulfed into thingsthe end was well done and it was a good closure to the work the character does not die but he is changed indeed he awakens to thye doctrine of the state and accepts it yeah he has been tortured and brainwashed but he does not give in under that torture though seeds are definitely laidif you have the time and you like depressing books about totalitarian states that try to stamp out individual thought and reason go ahead and pick this book up if you want something lighter though i would try to find something else.

with the advancement of homeland security here in the united states we are beginning to see the onset of a true big brother the number of agencies fbi cia ins and other alphabet soup organizations are now cross matching databases they are gathering information from local municipalities and those that are in the system better not have anything to hideseptember th accelerated the path that we were already on i hope that some sanity is also metered out in the processafter being a futures author investor and broker for the past  years one of the glaring points in the book is how statistical data is constantly being modified and rewritten to serve who will benefit from the moment i just hope that these mistakes misquotes and misinformed changes never occur in such a draconian fashiongreat book everyone should have a copy on their shelves.
  Negative
at first i did like the book then it just started to suck right around the time when winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend i hated the book so much that i forgot her name the first hundred or so pages i liked then it just got really boring so ii highly reccomend that you do not read this book and please for the love of god dont read that brave new world book by hoxley it is twice as worse as  to put it bluntly dont read any george orwell your just waisting your time.
  Negative
george orwell imagined the future in a dull state where every single thought emotion and action would be monitored by the government tells the story of winston living in a socialist country feeling depressed and then deciding to rebelorwell is able to convey the helplessness of winston as well as his routine by use of short snappy sentences however as the plot thickens orwell extends the sentences conveying wintons hope and rebellion is truly captivating and rather depressing as i read i saw everything in my mind as grey and broken but i couldnt put this book down.
  Negative
at first this book was not a book that i wanted to read it was assigned to me as an english project isu independent study unit so like every kid in high school i started to dread it as i started to read though the story started to get better and better there were points where i just wanted to continue reading and not put it down the story is very well written it gives you a very good idea as to what a dystopian world could potentially look like although at the beginning it does start out very slow it is a very good readif you read this book and enjoyed it also take a look at brave new world by aldous huxley it is quite similar to .
  Neutral
i had  ruined for me because i was forced to read it for school looking back it is a truly great book like many of the enduring works of science fiction its lasting popularity rests in the powerful archetpyes and metaphors it tapps into big brother the twominutes hate room  are all here whats scary is how some of this seems to be coming true  but big brother isnt so much the government as it is corporations just try getting away from a viewscreen nowadays also we watch the tv but the tv also watches us advertisers the internet and mtv control us more thoroughly than the government could ever hope to espire to instead of telling us we are at war with east asia we have always been at war with east asia they tell us what our values are what music we listen to what movies we watch etc we listen to britney spears we have always listened to britney spears orwell wouldve been so proud.
  Negative
ok maybe mr orwell intended it to be this way but it still doesnt hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the authors other works i read this book because i remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding animal farm years ago and this work was recommended by several of my friends if you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing check this out yes this is science fiction and just because some people call it a classic doesnt mean i like it if you want some of the best in this genre i recommend dune by frank herbert  a space odyssey by arthur c clarke or enders game by orson scott card.
  Negative
i thought it was a very dull and cheesy book every time i picked it up i fell asleep i had to read it for school and it took forever to get here when i ordered it barely finished it in time.
  Negative
i read this book for the first time in high school and found it mildly interesting i read it again recently and realized what an incredible piece of genius it really is the other thing i realized is that this book makes perfect sense as a satire of christianity big brother thought crimes room  it fits perfectly of course whether that was orwells intent i dont know though he was an atheist but i think the book is a masterpiece if analyzed in that way paul gehrman author kaleidoscope.
  Positive
for those of you who wrote that this novel does not make sense as a vision of the future and could never happen i would just ask you to look at nazi germany the soviet union from a historical perspective but then again there are  billion people in china who can not speak there mind without fear of being arrested and the government has control over how many children they can have thank god you live in a country where you can be free to read this novel the themes are as true today as when orwell wrote them the governments desire to control what people will think see clinton mans inhumanity to man see serbs and kosovo children please read the newspaper once and a while.

the moment i put this cd on and heard the light lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sunkissed gregorian chants followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat i knew this was going to be one journey id be willing to take for many years to comeand that was the impression i got from the first track alone imagine what ensued it only gets better from thereevery song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood and while i find this exotically soothing debut album by black ether an astonishingly overlooked group extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles id have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnicworld flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea.
  Negative
the cd isnt what i remember about liberace he was a great performer and showman on this cd  there is very little of his solo piano music very little grand piano type music at all most of what you do get is overshadowed by the background music i was disapointed.
  Negative
this book could be useful if the examples actually worked i have barely reached the th page and all ready i have found more errors than should be allowed in an entire book the examples are misquoted and several dont work the book might be more helpful if the proof reader knew enough on the subject to correct the more obvious errors if you buy this book be ready to experiment with the syntax which may be close but not always correct.

hi i bought this warmer for a vacation trip i was really dissapointed it wasnt even  minutes that i had it on for the first time and it started to get on fire melted plastic all over the place smoke like crazy all around the car it is very unsafe do not buy this product do not spend your money dont put your baby in danger if you have this plugged in your car cus the warmer might get on fire mine did i hope this review helps you i wont ever buy this product ever again.
  Negative
i bought this for our first long trip with the baby it was a waste of money and time my baby was on pumped milk so we couldnt just grab some hot water from a drive thru it would have taken hours for her milk to get warm enough and she is not that patient neither are most babies for that matter.

westwest yall this album is good for what it is meant to be west coast gangsta music its all about lowridin smokin chronic kickin it and gangbangin in the golden state those who are accustomed to down south music will probably not like some of the west coast funk its a different flavor for some me being from cali i love this stuff it is rare that someone captures the essence of the west i do agree with this not being the best album but its still worth buying its got enough headbangers to get you to the club thats caliya   stars.

exit to eden is one of annes best works in my opinion many people were turned off by the film adaptation why hollywood decided no one would want to see a bondage film is beyond me eg but this book focuses on the relationship of master and slave and what happens when the tables are turned anne has many sides and lestat is just one of them true rice fans will adore this beautiful work of fiction.
  Positive
this book was hard to put down the story was excellent and the erotic scenes were just as good like all of annes books this one was very tastefully done well worth it.
  Negative
perhaps in its time this book was cutting edge but for those of us within the lifestyle its tame and contrived to a very unsatisfying degree its ironic that the film adaptation was watered down even more and turned into one of the worst movies youre likely to see ann rice didnt deserve such treatmentthere are books that capture the true essence of the bdsm fanatsy that are much more engrossing and interestingly enough ms rice has written them as well writing as a n roquelaure see her trilogy in the sleeping beauty series.
  Neutral
let me start by saying that i never put down a book even if i dont like it this is one that i couldnt even get past the first few pages maybe i didnt give it a chance but the foul language and vile event depicted in the first few pages turned me off completely to this book im glad it was a free download on kindle i gave it two stars only because i didnt give it a chance to get better if i hadnt deleted it maybe i would give it another chance but i certainly wont pay for it.

i thought this was the worst book i ever read there was no point and way to confusing he would ramble on about stuff not even importnat to the plot i hated reading this stay away from this book.

if it is then i will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces the book proves one point to me burning books and their society is much better than ours where farenheit  can be published.
  Negative
fahrenheit  was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover this book is very difficult to read the correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand the setting is also very hard to have a visual picture although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand i think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book but if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this i also think you need to be above the th grade or a very advanced reader.
  Negative
i dont give very many things five starsbradburys novel is simple powerful beautiful and truly marvelousa negative utopia along the lines of brave new world or  i like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately utterly hopeful bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressiveyou know the plot  they burn books because theyre scared of ideas montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society this book makes me want to change the world and so i want you to read it and then maybe memorize ita quick read and a fairly easy read engrossing enough that you wont want to put it down and once you finish it you might be tempted to just start over and read it again i recommend doing just that.
  Positive
wow what a great book about a dystopian society censorship and the need of the state to keep the masses blind deaf and dumb if you enjoyed  brave new world or the giver you must read this it is now one of my favorites.

to be perfectly honest i really dont understand how this classic is rated below a star by any reader yes i know that every reader has their own personal taste but this story is a classic for the ages every kid in a middle school should have to read this story about how lucky we are to be able to read books no matter what the content or agenda the story might containanyone who has never read this story should pick up a copy and start immediately its the best  you will ever spend.
  Positive
confusing disturbing and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book firemen who start fires come on burning every book that exists this isnt a look into the future its a look into bradburys twisted little mind bottom line dont waste your time.
  Very negative
what appears on cursory reading to be a story of banned books with reflection is a comment on the systematic suppression of free thought and free speech the book gives insight into how those who look the other way or are concerned with rights only as applied to them can actually further the loss of individual freedoms a very thought provoking novel.
  Negative
i read this book as a teenager and i wanted my students to read it as well although i loved it i did not get the same reaction as when they saw the video however they did think the video was cheesy d.
i have always liked this book to read so i thought i would get it on cd ray bradbury reads it and it is very bad it was so painful to listen to his voice i had to turn it off he reads in such a monotone voice it put me to sleep someone needs to remake the cds.
  Negative
this book doesnt deserve one star it deserves negative  stars this was the worst book i have ever read the book moved to slow and the characters are stupid guy montag the main character is a fireman who sets books on fire becuase homes are fireproof then he meets this crazy girl nmaed clairese who rambles about dumb stuff of the past that is not important like did you know that one time billboards were only  feet long instead of  who cares if there is one book that deserves to be burnt it is this.
  Very negative
this is definitely one of the worst books i have ever come across in the modern version there is a forword and an introduction both of them have nothing to do with the story and ray bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that no one cares about i almost fell asleep during the forword i dont know how i survived the book the book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace as for ray bradbury himself he states in the introduction that in his eyes hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book i think that this statement is pretty much self explanatory for his views on humanity great guy eh.
  Very negative
being only a teenager what i have to say usually means nothing or gets no credit i personally loved this book reading it just a day ago i was entirely captivated with the plot and the idea of censorship in the future and that it was precise that it being a book would be censored is unbelievable what possesses any person to censor a book that is so realistic it is amazing to actually prove to the writer that his writings are so precise is astonishing i would recommend this to anyone you dont need to love to read just know how to read.
  Negative
i felt the author of the book should of described the war a little more still i thought it had some very interesting perspectives on how the world might becomei thought it was weird how all the fireman looked the same the mechanical hound was a great part of the story it had us guessing if it would attack montag or not over all i felt this book was well worth reading.
  Negative
i was actually forced to read this book for a high school english class and fell in love with it its simply chilling in its portrayal of the future and the deliberate ambiguity about clarrise is very cool the deeper themes in this book make it one completely rife with feeling a very poignant book its definitely a mustread.
  Very positive
this book is a very important mustread for every person living in america at this time in history the paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the dumbing of america that is going on today are quite unnerving and quite scary this book should be required reading for everyone who has ever turned on the television to escape from the world which is just about everyone in this country.

being forced to read it in school for its so calledrelation to censorship sp i would have to say burn it althoughthe book is about censorship and whyhow it is wrong i cant say much good about it the theme itself is good but the story itself is trash one of the most unrealistic ideas ive ever heard first off everyone in the country is an idiot second that includes the hero third even those who have minds of their own have no intellegence and finally way to many cracks in the foundation of the story and two many holes in the story itselflr.

i read fahrenheit  this year in the seventh grade as a required reading as i read this book i got more and more confused the plot twisted and turned and left me hanging wondering wait what happened mr bradbury used large words that i learned as vocab i would recommend this book to no one under the age of about  maybe  i chose this age because of the hard concepts of burning books and the fastmoving plot of the hound.

perhaps it is dated perhaps it was just built up too much but this is yet another book that came highly recommended both by other daytoday readers and critics alike that i just could not enjoybradburys tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise but it does not seem to follow through for me which is a shame  here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives but it is so boring that rather than get something out of it you just come away thinking how boring it isor at least i did.

i enjoyed this book very much because it gives you an extreme look towards censorship and how the media can influence the way we think an individuals ideas and thoughts are shunned for society in general.

this is my first reread of this book as an adult im now  i recalled enjoying the book a lot when i first read it around the age of   i recently recommended it to my daughter age  and she thought it was one of the best books she ever read my attitude now towards the subject of potential loss of freedom combined with mass culture although much more downtoearth than it was in my teens is still pretty much the same respect and appreciation of human freedom of expression bradbury is very clear in his fight for freedom the extreme fictional situation he devised is now more real than ever  true we are not prohibited from keeping books in this country anyway but we are offered enough mass culture that most people will spend hours in front of the tv rather than reading books or visiting museums i do that a lot too it is hard to believe that this book was written in the s.
i bought this book on tape as read by the author it is excruciating to listen to dont get this i should have known that an actor would be a better reader than an author.

fahrenheit  is set in a time where reading books is strictly forbidden in this world instead of putting out fires and keeping people safe firefighters burn entire houses containing books and occasionally even people one of these firefighters guy montag has doubts about the whole situation and those doubts are strengthened when he meets a freethinking girl by the name of clarisse mcclellan the major themes in this book include the value of intelligence and human interaction i would suggest everyone read this book at least once to help understand why it is important to attain knowledge and break free from ignorance i overall liked this book and would give it a .

the book was not so good as the movie but the book helps understanding some points that seemed totally random when i saw itcompared to  its miles away but still is really nice.

i first read this book for an english assignment at school after reading the first few pages i was completely lost bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic it is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot definetly not the greatest book in the world personally i hated the book.
  Negative
