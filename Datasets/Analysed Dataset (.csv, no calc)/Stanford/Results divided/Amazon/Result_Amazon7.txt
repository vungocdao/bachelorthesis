what a waste of two hours as a romantic comedy it falls short on both romance and comdey as a movie trying to give over a lesson it is trite overdone and poorly performed the writing is unimpressive the story is dull and far fetched and many details either make no sense or detract from the overall plot what was the point they seemed to have forgotten to find one.

the john houseman character from the excellent james caan original version jumped into a time machine with the intent of destroying the social commentary critical to multinational monopolies from the first film and spreading cultural plastics so prevalent in his future history the result is dumbed down junk where you must give up the idea of wondering how movie executives decisions are made i think he did a good job.

i should say worse than battlefield earth proportions this whole movie makes you just sit there at the end and go why everything about this convoluted sarcastic beefed up badly edited tripe is confusing to watch poorly executed and loses you  minutes into the film you are introduced to boring characters cliched camera angles and material we all know john mcteirnan is far more capable of i was thankful i got to rent this instead of buying it because quite frankly this movie just plain stinks if you really want to see the real rollerball rent dont buy the original the original has a much stronger story and for cryin out loudjames caan hes a legend man i dont know what kind of future chris klein has in movies but as far as action movies go lets just put it this way we already have keanu reeves and quite bluntly hes a much better actor steer clear and save your money.

although these sheets are pretty and warm their size and fit are horrible the fitted bottom sheet is far too long plus the elastic around the corners is not tight enough to keep the sheet on the mattress which tends to come off through the night and the flat sheet is barely wide enough i would not buy these again.
  Negative
these run very large and do not fit correctly because of this however for the price i still think they are a great bargain they are very heavy duty and will probably last many years they are also very warm almost too warm here in southen california those people in cold climates would love them anyhow i would be giving five stars except for the mismatched fit but i just tucked it in really good and they stay on the bed just fine.

okay i had to read this book for a fantasy lit class i am taking my teacher and all of my fellow classmates it seems find it hilarious i however am left wondering whyi understand what hes getting at with religion and what not ive just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors the characters are boring and flat his humor is downright stupid this book is not clever in the least if you dont know the things hes pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty you really need to think for yourselfi guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel but then the back of the book does say he is a popular author and like most things that are popular it must be accessible to the public or else they wont understand.

the many ideas given eat the inside of sandwiches eat the top off of canapes avoid the crust can give a true celiac serious consequences sometimes a person can eat gluten with no obvious side effects but do great silent damage to ones intestines there are complications to celiac disease such as refractory sprue and collagenous sprue i have these complications due to not being strict enough when following the gluten free diet.
  Negative
i have read the other reviews of this book and while i appreciate everyones opinions i must say that this book helped me immensely i am new to the gluten free life i have been ill for two years and am just finding out that gluten is one of my issues i had no prior knowledge and this book did a lot to allay my fears i havent read against the grain so i cannot compare the two jax made me laugh often even through my tears i recommend it for those just starting out.

my sister was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and there is a strong chance that i may have it as well i wanted to read about it to learn more and was told that this book was a great place to start unfortunately i found the book to be poorly written and with the most bizarre suggestion.

most of the people who gave shining sparkly reviews of this book focus on how it made them feel it is not boring jax is a talented writer ill give her that but when i read on page  that the perscription drugs i was on and had been on for  years both pfizer drugs were not gf i was seriously troubledmany followups with both pfizer and online support groups have indicated just how full of erroneous information this book isi went off my meds immediately thinking i was injesting gluten i suffered the undue consequences of going off cold turkey when i needed to taper off in actuality those meds are gf and always wereif you want the facts as boring as they are  dont rely on this book if you want some comfort and laughs then give it a read but be sure to take any factual information with a grain of salt as they sayjax was indeed very lax when writing this book.

what a wonderful easy book to read and so helpful so many books and articles on this subject are just too plain technical and boring to read not the glutenfree bible it is clear easytounderstand and very engaging i really appreciate how the author relates the issues of living glutenfree to everyday life it is an intelligent book that is fun to read and very very informative at the same time i have never written a book review before but i am so impressed with the glutenfree bible that i want to share these thoughts with everyone and i intend to rush out to buy the other books by this insightful witty writer enjoy to your health.

the only type of person to whom i could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a forest level view of them from one source there is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability the series from the gesell institute your one year old your two year old etc etc provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages raising your spirited child is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child i am saddened and more than a bit annoyed i purchased the book on the basis of the organizations recommendation that the american academy of child  adolescent psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight.

a rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period houses argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument an argument which goes something like this many impressionist works and also those by manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and techniquethey are thus subversivedisruptive and oppositional and as a result political i had expected the book to address in a more explicit detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics however many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter  the viewer of modern life is well worth a read.

ive studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of freuds work in philosophy of psychology while making some entertaining remarks freud has now long been discounted as anything valid and understandably so.
  Positive
this book is a watershed in human intellectual history in it freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes our inner unconscious lives dreams are not nothing and they are not in freuds eyes rare religious gifts but rather to the key to our own mental life freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations i am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing i do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretationsunderstanding human intellectual history is now impossible without knowing this work.
  Negative
freuds the interpretation of dreams is a unique book his treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind but neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book the great achievement of freuds theory is its immunity to criticism in other words it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book his main tenet  a dream is a fulfillment of a desire  cannot be attacked in any intelligible way if one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment or if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished viz the desire to destroy freuds dream theory.

this tape is simply fun and informative i am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but i had to watch this im a woman why not the lady is so corky and yet serious enough to have you practically writing notes like your in a college i would recommend this video to anyone interested in really learning about childbirth she explains everything how your body should be functioning what is stretching what liquids to look for as signs of this and that charts of how the baby is actually sitting and how exactly its growing and she even quizzes the husbands there is so much to learn open a bag of kettle corn and grab a pillow though its like four or five hours long phew but it probably wouldnt be best to watch it all in one sitting anyway it is a lot of information to grasp enjoy.

i read this book  years ago its still makes me highly agitated every time i think about it you just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end it has the worst ending ever it still pisses me off that i spent the time reading it there isnt really much of a story just a lot of details and weird issues there are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with any sort of common sense aside do not read if you are sensitive to rape that should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere not recommended.

this was their first true recording project although it was thier second full album i give this album four stars because though i love this album and this band five stars would mean its an album that stands next to physical graffitti the white album and a select few other records this album is a must own for fans who enjoy any of the splinter disciplines of what sabbath hendrix and zeppelin started an album worth the money with many great songs and performances if there are any criticisms one would be the production it leaves some room for improvement beyond that i hope this band can continue to build upon this awesome release for years to come purchas and enjoy.

do not order this item and expect to get what you see i ordered the super high speed card rpsdhgua and what i got was a low quality high speed card rpsdkgua seems to be some kind of a scam that ritz is running with amazons blessing buyer beware this has happened to me before when you order from one of amazons partners and amazon will do nothing to help you.
  Very negative

a jesse stuart harvest is a collection of stories by jesse stuart all the stories bring out his personality and the talking of the old west this book also has an introduction that narrates the life of the author jesse stuarti think this book is really good because it takes you on a trip through time and into a world of adventure my favorite story was snake teeth because it has a lot of cliffhangers and adventure i would recommend this book for  yrsadults because normally after  years of age you will understand the dialect in this book.

here is another example of hollywood going wrong the history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right nevertheless the film makers got a few details correct but then added improbable special effects far too many triplanes annoying social lesson stereotypes and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage conceptually the movie should have been a winner in execution it is a disappointment they ruined a potentially good story instead of buying this movie i would suggest the blue max as the aerial scenes are far better or just propose that the wouldbe viewer read a history bookas a parting comment however i always have liked jean reno he is the good part of this film.

i have enjoyed watching flyboys several times the special effects are outstanding and very lifelike one of the features that i really enjoyed was watching the bonus features at the end i noticed that one of the people interviewed was from colorado and as a result i went to his museum and checked out versions of some of the planes represented in the moviei find the investment in time and money for this feature was well worth it.
  Very positive
