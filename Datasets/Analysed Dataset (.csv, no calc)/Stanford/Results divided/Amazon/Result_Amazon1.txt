my lovely pat has one of the great voices of her generation i have listened to this cd for years and i still love it when im in a good mood it makes me feel better a bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain this cd just oozes life vocals are jusat stuunning and lyrics just kill one of lifes hidden gems this is a desert isle cd in my book why she never made it big is just beyond me everytime i play this no matter black white young old male female everybody says one thing who was that singing .
  Positive
despite the fact that i have only played a small portion of the game the music i heard plus the connection to chrono trigger which was great as well led me to purchase the soundtrack and it remains one of my favorite albums there is an incredible mix of fun epic and emotional songs those sad and beautiful tracks i especially like as theres not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks i must admit that one of the songs lifea distant promise has brought tears to my eyes on many occasionsmy one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs which i find distracting but even if those werent included i would still consider the collection worth it.
  Negative
i bought this charger in jul  and it worked ok for a while the design is nice and convenient however after about a year the batteries would not hold a charge might as well just get alkaline disposables or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.
  Negative
check out maha energys website their powerex mhcf charger works in  minutes for rapid charge with option for slower charge better for batteries and they have  mah batteries.
  Negative
reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines i am weaning off my vhs collection but dont want to replace them with dvds this unit is well built easy to setup and resolution and special effects no progressive scan for hdtv owners suitable for many people looking for a versatile productcons no universal remote.
  Negative
i also began having the incorrect disc problems that ive read about on here the vcr still works but hte dvd side is useless i understand that dvd players sometimes just quit on you but after not even one year to me thats a sign on bad quality im giving up jvc after this as well im sticking to sony or giving another brand a shot.
  Negative
i love the style of this but after a couple years the dvd is giving me problems it doesnt even work anymore and i use my broken ps now i wouldnt recommend this im just going to upgrade to a recorder now i wish it would work but i guess im giving up on jvc i really did like this one before it stopped working the dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.
  Very negative
i cannot scroll through a dvd menu that is set up vertically the triangle keys will only select horizontally so i cannot select anything on most dvds besides play no special features no language select nothing just play.
  Negative
exotic tales of the orient from the s dr shen fu a weird tales magazine reprint is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price if youre tired of modern authors who all sound alike this is the antidote for you owens palette is loaded with splashes of chinese and japanese colours marvelous.
  Negative
firstlyi enjoyed the format and tone of the book how the author addressed the reader however i did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal if you are just starting to research law school and do not know all the requirements of admission then this book may be a tremendous help if you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions i recommend some more topicspecific books for example books on how to write your personal statment books geared specifically towards lsat preparation powerscore books were the most helpful for me and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation yet for those new to the entire affair this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.
  Negative
i currently live in europe and this is the book i recommend for my visitors it covers many countries colour pictures and is a nice starter for before you go and once you are there.
  Positive

  Positive
this game requires quicktime  to workif you have a better version of quicktime i have  it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the cdif you click no it will not let you play so i begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try and it installed quicktime  then it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc it kept telling me that even after i uninstalled my version of quicktime  and reinstalled barbie rapunzel and quicktime  very frustrating and the game absolutely will not work for me it keeps telling me over and over to install quicktime  tho ive been through the installation process repeatedly it is not my operating system limitations this is a brand new computermerely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.
  Negative
i have been using this product for a couple years now i started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers this actualy came in the relaxer kit i tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use i could not find it in any of the stores at the time so i searched amazon and they had it i absolutely love it it is the best moisturizing product i have used so far my hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was i am very happy with it.
  Negative

  Negative
first of all the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped a week and a half later i received another email telling me that they are sorry but they dont actually have any of these items and if i received an email telling me it has shipped it was a mistakewhen i finally got my money back i went through another company to buy the product and it wont work with my phone even though it depicts that it will i have sent numerous emails to the company  i cant actually find a phone number on their website  and i still have not gotten any kind of response what kind of customer service is that no one will help me with this problem my advice  dont waste your money.
  Negative
this is an awesome game almost everyone know tictactoe so it is easy to learn and quick to play you cant play just once the twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes  just big enough to gobble up your opponent the first person to make tictactoe wins but its not as easy as it looks when youre stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities my  and  year olds will beat me even when im trying to win excellent beginning critical thinking game grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.
  Negative
for the price of  this pc game is well worth it great graphics colorful and lots to do my four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little ones very own parade.
  Positive
this is an excellent album with some great fiddle playing ryan is amazing to watch when he plays in person you can feel the emotion he puts into each song.
  Very positive
ive read this book with much expectation it was very boring all through out the book.
  Negative
this product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so i spent  and havent worn then i wouldnt buy this product again dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
  Negative
the magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that victoria magazine has come to represent i have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day.

  Positive
if you purchase this data cable you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works as directed i downloaded all of the files from the se site mb on dial up and then downloaded all of the user guides everything seemed to install ok but nothing would make my phone be recognized after that i scoured the se site for troubleshooting info on their branded cablein the hope that something would help me figure out the problem after  full days of beating my head against the wall i finally threw the cable and the useless cd that came with it in the trashif i had used my brain i would have paid the extra  for a se branded cable and software and the support that comes along with that i now have the real deal se data cable and software and guess what yep installation was a breeze and it works beautifully you really do get what you pay for.
  Negative
like many of the barbie cd roms the playtime is limited  averaging about  mins for each of my two daughters ages    like the barbie movies and other cd roms the graphics are poorly done.
  Negative
i bought this item to connect to a strobe light unit functions well not sure that it has all the range claimed but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this just too many variables i can say it works from my neighbors house into my garag.
  Negative
i suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have lineofsight with the device lamp etc plugged into this control it might work maybe but i had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit and it was completely unreliableid recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product.
  Positive
ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off ive been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want under my desk shelf etc.
  Negative
very disappointed in this product it worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated it was very inexpensive so i did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction.
  Very negative
this is the all time best book she mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire who knows well anyway i like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush ps i think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world.
  Positive
cant believe i have never reviewed this book before first read this back when i was  like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soulmates which drug me into these books rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
  Negative
lj smith is the best author in the whole world i read this book a year ago but i cant stop reading it it is beyond sweet i love ashthe entire night world seris is the bomb i read mostly everyone of lj smiths book and they all are awesome i think ash and mary lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates i loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldnt there should be real guys like ashquinnjuliundamongabriel and i can go on forever i think everyone should read at least one lj smith book if you do youll be hooked on them for lifelike i am lj smith is the best.
  Negative
this book was so great i loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart i just hope that there is a follow up on this story because i want to know if marylynette and ash get together.
  Positive
apart from it arriving broken the first time my kids are loving this dvd which i alternate with the other i purchased to keep my own sanity this dvd has created a thomas fan out of my   yr old daughter as well.
  Positive
my children get easily bored with this video i thought it was several episodes of thomas but it has a lot of just children and parents talking about thomas and all it doesnt keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking this was my first thomas video purchasehopefully the next will have more shows and less talking.
  Positive
i went online for information about dockers khaki pants the size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores i was very impressed with the selection i had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length the delivery was quick especially during christmas and i really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.
  Negative
merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants so when it was shipped i was charged  again when the second pair was in stock weeks laterwill not buy from amazon vendors again.
  Negative

  Negative
this is a great cd i love weib kreuz the anime is awsome its bout  guys hhhooottt who work at a flower shop but at night they are the white hunters or byce as in the anime they are assasins that hunt the tomorrow of bad guys the bad guys the police cant get  like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason from a strange gas substance that w instant contact ingulfs any object but i couldnt resist its also an emotional anime at times i think this is a cd and anime any anime fan should see.
  Positive
i was looking forward to receiving this book as i was going to new orleans to antoines restaurant i read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy this book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that i could not read it without my eyes watering i sent it back at my own expense and to date i have not had a refund.
  Negative
this book is simply great if you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize html and present its syntax willynilly this book is the only book ive ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup it explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook html with other technologies without trying to teach cgi css etc at the same time the only thing i wish is that this guy would write a javascript or dhtml book id buy that right away.
  Negative
this is a tearjerker mixed with humor a lot of rough patches for this couple but dont let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times too i watch this movie often as i am a hopeless romantic and i thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing hindi style  pop rock mix plus its worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts it ends the way a typical relationship of this type would but thats not exactly a bad thing in this case i recommend it to everyone.
  Negative
love itvery touchits to bad that in the dvd description doesnt mention no subtitles.

  Negative
the reason i gave two stars when i usually give  stars for ms feehans books is bc this book was tooooooo mysterygothic genre rather than romance i really didnt feel like the two main characters were in love in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroines point of view and i was getting sick of her whining and her point of view unlike the dark series you really didnt feel any passion the book is better suited for the mysterygothic genre and not romanceeven the mystery was not that good its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages throughout the entire book youre kept in suspense of who was the bad guy if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pagesms feehan if your reading please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery.
  Negative
i have read all of the carpathian novels to date except one i very much enjoyed them at first but nothing ever gets resolved you would think that after  books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced as for this book it is an offshoot of another carpathian novel about the jaguar line i was hoping to find out more about this curse the origins and why the males kill the females nothing not a word about the jaguar curse and why do the walls and ceilings change ideas introduced and left at that ms feehan went once again off on a tagent her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive i will not be buying any further books by this author what a shame.
  Very negative
we purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship the bag was convenient to carry however the faux leather began peeling at first it wasnt so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes i would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that i had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes.
  Negative
i was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to patricia cornwell well now i cant put her books down her books just get better and better as you go through the kay scarpetta seriesi really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book its nice to see the characters develop through each story line it allows you to get comfortable with them get close to them and get frustrated with them when they do something out of characteri highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire kay scarpetta series.
  Negative
this is an awesome book kay just keeps getting better and better its also fun to see the characters develop more with each book  kay herself as she seems to be always one against the world marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic in this book kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings it appears that a recently executed murderer who kay herself has seen on her autopsy table is still around committing crimes a number of murders occur where the executed murderers fingerprints are turning up kay marino and benton try to track a killer but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere this is a taut and totally believable thriller i cant wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment.
  Positive
parricia corwell cruel  unusual was breathtaking in the beginning her relation to her family her dedication to her work exeptional however this story began to get boring towards the endthe ending not too great.
  Neutral
saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste  agonizing minutes of their lives in a nutshell i have heard many more clever jokes and oneliners watching king of queens on cableseriously folks its that badthe bad jokes and the  references to small jewish penises got old real quick thought i would always be a sandler fan but he clearly adam was in need of some rent money and jumped on this script for the cash and ranwhy else would the plot line include seth rogan writing for him to put things into perspective this film made bruno look like casablanca.
  Negative
i should have known going into this movie having judd apatow a part of it would mean i would hate it however having adam sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a very hopeful chance the movie loses its true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible  crude jokes i have to say we didnt make it more than  minutes into the movie before turning it off it is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior i just dont believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior very disappointing.
  Negative
this has just about everything the rabbi of course is learned and devout even if his schooling causes some nervousness the cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech the visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of smalltowners can summon and around all of that the monotonous drama of life unfolds loves losses and changes that no one knows how to ride outcomics have moved well past the bampow genre into many other idioms  this might border on chick lit but much less than some if reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you with deep family devotions and deeper or shallower personal ones the ragged lines of this comic might touch you wiredweird.
  Negative
this grill is one of its kindit can be use anywhere without so much hard workit fits snugly anywhere.
  Negative
i had never read this author but knew of many who did when i read that this book was being made into a movie it seemed a good opportunity to read her before seeing the screen mess up her work now i pray that the screen does soi was extremely disappointed with this work it is unrealistic fails to capture the reader and at points when i should have been completely engrossed left me struggling with whether i wanted to pick it up i hope she has written better than this or else there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors availableher characters are not sympathetic they do not draw the readers attention and they are dull in overall scope i have too many other good books to read before i pick up another book from this author.
  Neutral
this was a very good book with excellent descriptions its a real page turner and keeps you wondering whats going to happen next the best parts are at the very beggining and the end.
  Positive
my first foray into the novels of patricia cornwell has left me impressed the characters were intense and realistic my only concern is that the evil temple gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning why did he decide to trail and give gifts to dr scarpetta needless to say i will be reading more of cornwells books especially if they are at all like this novel.
  Negative
the publisher said soon to be a movie does anyone know if a movie was ever created.
  Negative
this was only my first cornwell novel and im hooked in the past few months i have managed to collect all of her books and i cant wait to dive into them this summer will be a suspensful one for scarpetta and i.
  Negative
i have read all of the scarpetta novels  this is not the worst that would be cause of death but rt up there i thought the story began well enough but the ending was lame the plot was predictable lucy is nauseating as ever  wish shed die scarpetta is still overly materialistic  selfrighteous which has gotten oldone of many gripes would be that i find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies  the media have zero knowledge of this serial killers family background close family members  like a twin sistermy advice  dont let this be your st scarpetta novel.
  Very negative
great racquet but im a power hitter i have no power generating difficulty with this racquet my style is to try to volleyball and everything ive found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered i like the factory grip although with distinct ridges others prefer a smooth grip may  give the factory grip on chance and you may come to like it the sale prices are right for a high about end racquet racquets and black knight in have a reputation for overall durability so you should get plenty of use before replacement note i got my first cc as a d level player and did not like it immediately howeve as my game improved version i switched from my bandit black knight cc white racquet to the great success and have had so it might not be the right racquet for a beginner intermediate to advanced players but will benefit from this fine racquet.
  Negative
started laughing in the second chapterenjoyed the book after i realized that i wasnt going to learn anything new its obviously a miracle that we survived for the  years since it was first publishedand seeing that the pending insolvency of the us was as loudly shouted in the s as it is now was worth the price this book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the uskudos to whoever owns the copyright  now theres economics in action.
  Negative
i was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery sure back then there was no google searching nor number crunching laptops but plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent probably the books greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences even with todays analytical resources economists are still all over the map on their predictions  conclusions on the other hand meteorologists seem to do quite wellnaturally the radical libertarians teabaggers  republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence i would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty  irrational.
  Very negative
edith has created a venue for herself to exorcise melancholic memories with painful melodies there are no disguises on this collection lonesome guitars and medicinal piano radiate the mood of broken spirits she writes all her own songs these ballads are definite reminders of those unbearable moments we all have to live they are all gray sky secludedisolating tunes i envision a ironical pace i thought she was from chicago millions and millions of people and she sings stark loneliness.
  Negative
i recently purchased this camera and im very satisfied with it i find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital it is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use i highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price nice going sony.
  Positive
the sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right i am  size   lbs before baby and i gained about  lbs during pregnancy just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies i dont like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like i have back boobs the shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesnt feel smooth all over squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage if you do decide to purchase this product its easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts.
  Positive
i think this product provided a great fit i was able to hook on the first row by myself within about  mins max it wasnt quite as difficult to get on as i thought it might be although it isnt particularly easy either i tried it on and wore for about  hours and then the nd time i wore it had it on for about the same period of time i took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom this product is far too expensive to have something like that happen the fit on me was snug but i am sure i had the correct size now i have to figure out how to get this resolved.
  Negative
i love love love the squeem the before and after pictures are definitely real you can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture you eat much less since it squeezes the hell outta you but its not an uncomfortable squeeze.
  Positive
a friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress i brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but i needed a small it was extremely difficult to put on so i needed assistance once it was on i was still able to contract my core which meant that i needed a smaller size i believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso other then that this is great buy.
  Neutral
i ordered the squeem waist shaper in a size smallmy general size is  im  and weigh lbs right no.
  Negative
the squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best while the product compresses your stomach the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends i have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through at one point the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom it scraped my stomach and i took it off immediately i have never washed the product in the washing machinei have always handwashed it so the manufacturer cant say that i didnt take good care of it.
  Negative
i ordered this product to slim down my stomach i was looking for something i could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses i wore the squeem to work occasionally and then i would take it off when i got home when i would take it off i felt sore around my sides and my back i washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didnt one night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so i ended up keeping the squeem on for about hours instead of my normal  hours that night when i took the squeem off i had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks im blackon my body i read other review before i purchased the squeem and i didnt see anything that alerted me not to buy it not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you dont say i didnt warn you.
  Very negative
i was really unhappy with this i followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size it was way too small at  weeks postpardum im ten weeks postpardum and may try it again but it was a real selfesteem crusher initially im a size  prepregnancy and so i thought it was fair to order the xs but i guess not.
  Negative
my wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size she made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small we have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins thats why she wanted the apparel she was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didnt fit.
  Negative
i have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasnt elastic based found this item and have to say i am pretty pleased the hooks do take a while but once they are all done the waist cincher does what it says it will do the only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about it does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms so i cant wear this with a top that is clingy can only wear with looser fitting shirts oh well nothing is perfect.
  Negative
the author is very likely a kurdish nationalist not implausibly a quite supporter of the pkk as a communist he has no room for religion his analysis is misleading basically he runs after muslims under the banner of islamism he seeks to undermine the islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs the author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that islam does not work the author does not use objective scientific methods he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions read the book if you wish but with such qualifications in mind you may read it to understand how the bigots mind actually works.
  Negative
this novella stretched to  pages by wide margins and doublespaced lines reads like a screenplay treatment there is very little character development movielike dialogue and plenty of mindless action the ending is wholly unsatisfying and im led to believe that this is simply a setup for another book an author with some integrity would have placed edge of danger as part  of a part novelif you are deadset on reading edge of danger dont waste your money the cover price of is an insult and the deeply discounted  price will still leave you feeling rippedoff go to your local library in the morning and youll finish edge of danger in time for an early lunch just dont expect to have any appetite left.
  Very negative
i have read many of jack higgins books and this is the poorest so far in my humble belief as i travelled thro the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which mr dillon strolls thro the events at hand the story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story mr dillon is just to scifi im afraidthere is a quote at the start of the book and as i got near the final chapters i was starting to imagine that the author would be writing the finale of mr dillonthe quote readto tess who thinks its about timeauthor i think she may mean something else.
  Very negative
its got a nice warm scent of vanillalike smell texture is creamy meadow sweet is a nice nude color cant apply too much or else itll look a bit dry.
  Positive
west is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work he has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses.
  Positive
a refreshing sunwarmed beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of ice age europe a delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive the plot line moves in different ways from other woman against the odds novels so it is a fresh and not predictable a very good read and a much better choice over jean auels shelters of stone.
  Very positive
i found it preachy and long and gotvery bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologuethen tried to find theactual novelfinally gave up.
  Negative
the abridged version of this book would read as sosin is inevitable so make the best of bad situations and oh by the way women are strongthere ya go nuff said i dont need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire  odd pages or so of this travesty the entire book is just one big complaint from the girl who commits adultery she laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well painfully thick language stupid storyline quixotic style everything that would piss off a recreational reader avoid it.
  Negative
this book was recommend  me from my neighbor but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book  recommend i didnt like it  much but.
  Negative
i really enjoyed this book it shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake cant go wrong with the classics.
  Positive
this review refers to isbn  with no explanation or indication that it is doing so this edition leaves out the authors introductory chapter the customhouse admittedly the chapter is long tedious and skipped by many still it leaves the book useless for the classroom and lets face it who else is going to read it this isnt exactly light summer readingin addition there is no bolding of sat words with definitions in the margins that some reviewers mention which was the main reason i chose this edition in fact other than the abbreviated text there is absolutely nothing no forward no readers guide no author bio  nothing so not the most helpful textbookon the bright side it is wellbound and the type is quite easy to readi am returning the book and looking for a more suitable edition.
  Negative
the creepiest book ive ever read its a creepy mysteryromance all in one creepy book i would read it again lol.
  Negative
if this book is so great then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone to the best of my knowledge only erudites and scholars enjoy this book a good book but one with a limited audience dont read it unless you dont mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences antiquicated words and flowery prose personally i like an author who gets to the point.
  Negative
this book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written hawthorne is a great writer but i dont know how this book made it into that sacred list we call classics perhaps on the merit of his name alone.
  Negative
the scarlet letter by nathaniel hawthorne is a great novel it takes place in boston massachusetts during the era when puritans were there the main character hester prynne is forced to wear a scarlet letter a for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from europethe book really recaptures what puritanism was like its interesting to think about what america would be like if we were still puritan a theme of the book is concealed guilt the minister arthur dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain the message of the book is that you shouldnt let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your lifethe book denounces the religious atmosphere of the puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of old england you get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of chaucer was lost in america due to the influence of the puritans.

i couldnt listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if youre into audio books.

i ordered the penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started it was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination i paid for the penguin edition i got the  dover thrift edition three weeks later when i called the distributor he told me to email him to remind him to fix it but he didnt ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer i asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email the email address from the confirmation email didnt work i had to spend another  to get the correct edition of the book id already paid more for the book that i got than it would have been worth brand new i will not purchase from this distributor again.

much to my amazement this book has been placed on banned lists in several states its an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt although the story does allude frequently to adultery there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear.

the best book that i have ever been assigned to read for school by far the way in which hawthorne captures the shame that hetser  the wearer of the scarlet letter feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with hester and the revenge ridden character of chillingworth is spectactularthe way in which hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader since hester the main character concieved her daughter pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet a on her chest for the rest of her life the story starts on the day hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of boston starts from there a must read for any american.

although this book is considered a great work of literature written to describe the harshness of purtian new england plus this book was heavily laiden with symbolism and many other literary toolsthe scarlet letter is a soap opera and a bad one at that not only is it boring no true action occurs in this book nothing truly interesting happens in this book this boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison dooralthough the author did a creative job of conveying his point this is still the worst book i have ever read i would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first  pages this is a good book to study however it is not a good book to read for pleasure under any circumstance.

one might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors although i respect those who disliked the scarlet letter i disagree its no wonder that people that dont know how to capitalize the word i i thought that this book was wonderful if you are willing to put effort into understanding it.
