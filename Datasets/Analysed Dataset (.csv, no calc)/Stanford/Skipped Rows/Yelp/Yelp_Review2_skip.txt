i wavered between  and  stars here if the rating was strictly based on food id go with  easily but its based on service too which is why i had to knock one off heres the deal  i love mortons its oldschool interior and nogimmicks shtick is awesome plus of course the food is fantastic however i wanted to branch out and ruths chris had some great reviews so i utilized yelps ohsoconvenient open table reservation feature and scored a table for two on a saturday night   our reservation was for  we arrived right on the dot but were told to go to the bar and wait so my boyfriend and i both got cocktails  he had glenlivet which is obvs hard to mess up and i got the peachy peartini which was delish and then we waited and waited around  our table was ready   our waitress was kristen and she was fantastic very attentive friendly witty and knowledgeable about the food heres our food rundown   barbequed shrimp app i initially thought was bbq sauce  shrimp but it aint its succulent lil shrimp in a deliciously garlicky white wineinfused sauce with a cayenne kick kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone and we happily took her up on that   ruths chopped salad holy crap the most memorable salad of my life i rarely rave about salads in fact i think this is the first time i ever have in my life but this salad was incredible it has crispy onion strings on top hearts of palm which i love and this amazing lemonbasil dressing among other delicious things so awesome   filet mignon my boyfriend and i both opted for the filet i got mine with extra butter he got his with a bleu cheese crust mine was phenomenal the sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond mortons my boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a lil too generous and he wound up scraping some off but still enjoyed it   broccoli au gratin again phenomenal ive never enjoyed broccoli so much granted it was swimming in bubbling gooey cheese   potatoes lyonnaise we took a risk here as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes and we saw mountains of them carried past our table but it paid off bigtime these were handsdown the best lyonnaise potatoes ever pamelas has nothing on these every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness i dream about these potatoes  so based on that experience we went back again the next saturday different waitress same food literally we ordered exactly the same items cause they were so damn good i dont remember the waitress name that we had the second time but we waited longer for food to appear were checked on far less she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before id gotten to pour it in my glass our steaks were not done correctly he got my mediumrare i got his mediumwell and it took forever to get the check i really think it ruins the experience when youre done eating and ready to go and youre just sitting there drumming your fingers looking around the dining room and wondering where the hell is the waitress with our check   that said we will definitely be back well just request to be seated in kristens section .
