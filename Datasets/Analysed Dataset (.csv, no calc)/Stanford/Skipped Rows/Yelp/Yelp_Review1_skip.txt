despite living in pittsburgh for most of my life ive somehow managed to never eat at maxs allegheny tavern until recently    my initial impression of the restaurant was positive  the place had an old neighborhood feel to it a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar and the german murals on the walls made me crave an icycold german lager with a stout head of foam  i thought about how well german potato salad would taste with that beer  so i grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer  and i waitedand waitedand waited some more  for over  minutes before someone came around to take the order  actually that isnt quite accurate  two employees came around  one to the end of the bar and one behind the bar directly opposite me  both of them stared at me  neither one greeted me or asked me what i would have like to order  i stared back incredulously and even made a whats going on here palmsextendedupwardshouldershrug gesture  neither one took the hint  finally a third employee came around the bar and took my order  great i thought to myself finally that beer  she served the beer in a mason jar  wtf  who serves imported german lager at a german restaurant in a freaking mason jar  maxs does  the beer was devoid of its head likely the result of a bad beer pour andor a less than perfectly clean glass an endemic problem with pittsburgh restaurants in my observation  i was sad  i quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu  my first impression of the menu can be summed as follows uhoh  the menu is huge with a number of slowfood stews and braises  the restaurant is more than halfempty  how can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items including more than a few laborintensive dishes freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isnt even halffull  answer they cant  the food isnt fresh  i ordered the wiener schnitzel  i love properly prepared wiener schnitzel  made with fresh butterflied veal breast slightly pounded and seasoned wellcoated in fresh bread crumbs and panfried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside wiener schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food    sadly maxs wiener schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared schnitzel  the veal was superthin had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed and tasted as if it was prebreaded and frozen  it wasnt pan fried either  the breaded frozen puck was simply dropped into a fryolater  where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places which doesnt happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly panfried  the edges of the sad schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate  curly schnitzel  my stomach dropped  my sides german potato salad and braised red cabbage were equally awful  the german potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen  the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup  the bacon in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed possibly faux meat  the potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness  exactly the homogeneity that is found in prepeeled presliced vacuumsealed processed potatoes  it was a gluey sickly sweet mess  i didnt have more than a bite or two  the braised red cabbage didnt taste fresh  it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten    maxs allegheny tavern bills itself on their web site as the best in german fare  the best in service  thats total bullshit  its awful  both for service and fare  if you want good authentic german fare in which the schnitzel is properly panfried to order and delicious join the teutonia mannerchor down the street    ill never return.

hotel restaurantbars are usually not known for being the best in town  so when i had the opportunity to eat and drink at soho recently i can not say i was surprised that i found the cuisine to be on the uninspiring side  is it terrible  no  but you know that better is out there    the blackened chicken wrap was boring  the flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland  also white tortillas just do not do it for me  why does it seem that pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty flavorless food  upon ordering the caesar salad on new years eve i was told that the restaurant has no non or lowfat dressing optionat all  however i can order a salad with french fries on it  seriously  the salad was fine by the way and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing  on the bright side the smoked turkey wrap which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good  the turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries  that i could eat again and it would  fill me up all day  i also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the mrs ts ones with franks hot sauce on them  they were good but uncreative considering the price   the drinks here are decently priced and pretty good  friends i was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choicesthey were strong drinks  when my coworker and i arrived though one night to dine here we were not offered cocktail menus so i just stuck with wine until i was no longer in the mood for a cocktail    service on new years eve was apathetic  granted the place was packed but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us  even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made  there are a ton of tvs here so it is a great spot to watch a game  even during busy times there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit    i think i would stop back here if i find myself at the springhill suites again but i definitely would not go out of my way to dine here  cant win em all right    protip  you can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to springhill suites without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one  want some good people watching  sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key  ridiculous  since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors this does not make any sense  but it is what it is so do not forget your key.
