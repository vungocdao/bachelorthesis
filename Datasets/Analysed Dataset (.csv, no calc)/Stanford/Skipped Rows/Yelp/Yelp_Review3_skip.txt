let me start by saying i was given a coupon for a free haircut and mani  you have to really let me down with free to get a twostar review  the haircut  lets put it this wayafter i went home and rewashed and restyled it i was really happy with it  i really liked the girl i had  i thought that she cut it just how i wanted  but then she asked if i wanted her to straighten it and i said no thanks because i have wavy hair thats pretty easy to make fancy read easy as in i dont use products or heat almost ever thanks even though its quite long  somehow she made my wash n wear waves into a frizzy stuff hot mess with some combination of gels and spray  then she told me she was going to dry my hair to  dry before sending me to the mani and then check on me later  okayyyyyy  overall haircut  style   stars  the mani this mani brought down the average rating of my visit as id give it one star  i havent gotten a lot of manismaybe a half dozen times for fancy eventsbut i know a bad one  it was freaking dirty at the mani station where a different girl did my nails  the towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it  seriously get some bleach  then i figured out what the stains werethe girl made me bleed on two fingers while cutting my cuticles  one bled quite a bit  but she just pretended like it wasnt happening and continued to chatter on about black friday shopping and her plan to score big  had the mani station not been in the very back of the salon i would have ran away whenthis is trueshe got up to use the restroom in the middle of mani  um i usually do my own nails but im guessing this isnt normal  as if she were aiming for the worst mani ever the polish wasnt even within the lines at all  then she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said shes get the stylist  mani   star  the stylist didnt come back after a couple minutes  when i asked the receptionist where the stylist was she didnt know  i just wanted to get out of there  so i took off the smock and left with wet hair and nails  i was pretty bummed since i had specifically scheduled the appointment on that particular afternoon because i had a big event that evening  i actually felt like a sucker tipping at more than  for these services  but i had put the tips in the little envelopes before i got my nails done and i didnt want to wait for them to dry to decrease the tip  so i tipped and left  summary free isnt great when you have to go home and immediately wash your hair and remove the nail polish.

please dont go here im begging you i wouldnt wish this place on my own worst enemy i wouldnt wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend this place was a literal nightmare   i think ive been to jimmy wans  times this month so i was sick of it plus id heard good things about taipei so i thought id give it a whirl  the service was abysmal  my waiter took  minutes to recognize id sat down he was very kind but only dropped my food off no hows it going no water refills no offer of dessert or other courses a kind busboy kept refilling my drink   the portions are extremely small  ive never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life the menu says theres a charge for fried rice instead of white huh jimmy wans offers white and brown no extra charge interesting  the atmosphere was atrocious  a family in the table to my left and in front let their child  or  mind you take off his shoes and walk around he then ground his heel into the carpet  with a piece of chicken in between he swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet i audibly gasped but his obese mother couldnt hear me or ignored me then she threatened to take each of their kindles away if they didnt shut up the boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long  the waitstaff saw what was happening and didnt care at all my waiter didnt show up after i was finished with my meal and when he did after id requested someone else get him he failed to clear my dirty plates i finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was  namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if i wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy youthink i want something to go how were  people in the  seat restaurant and one small takeout order howis that busy  other reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands if you care about your health dont go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesnt care if children grind chicken into the carpet if they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen i have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking  jews dont go here on christmas even if though they loudly advertise theyre open if  people means theyre busy can you imagine what itll be like on christmas  the slowness of the whole establishment is astounding i dropped my little brother off at jimmy wans immediately before going to taipei  a  second drive between establishments wans parking lot was jam packed and he ate with  other friends he called me to pick him up as i was paying the bill how the hell did taipei take as long as jimmy wans did to seat and serve and bill  people as they did me the th person in their restaurant  only go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist.
