Row 882
whats your opinion of an md who wears a three piece suit  when i see a doctor wearing a three piece suit the first thing that comes to my mind is why is he wearing a suit  did he wear a suit to class in med school  did he wear a suit doing rounds during residency  i know lawyers and investment bankers wear suits but doctors  i want to see my doctor in  a white coat   who wears a suit if they dont have to  am i obsessed with what people wear  not normally but when an md dresses in a suit then i cant stop wondering why  you get the picture  to me theres something not right about a doctor under the age of seventy wearing a suit  i could spend this review just commenting about workplace attire but i need to move on  dr stevens performs surgery at his surgery center  yikes   i hate doctors who have a business in addition to their practice  they see patients in the office they do surgery at their surgery center theres a conflict of interest here  is it possible that patients who may not need surgery are scheduled for a procedure to pay for all that expensive equipment  i hate incorporated doctors the gucci loafers  the conferences in new york anaheim orlando miami etc  making k  from a regular practice isnt enough  are you a doctor or a businessman   whats more important  helping the sick or your bottom line like i want a new boat that costs  and the down payment is  so i need to get  surgeries done in the next  weeks to get that payment together  if i want you to do my surgery at the mayo clinic is this possible   i want to have surgery at a hospital  because lets say something goes wrong  drastically wrong like i stop breathing  when this happens in a hospital they call code blue and every available doctor and nurse runs as fast as they can and does their best to get you breathing again  in a surgery center there may not be any other doctors and there may not even be a nurse  people die in surgery centers    when i hear surgery center i think of people getting liposuction and dying from blood loss in the recovery room because the doctor left and no trained medical staff are available   dr stevens is arrogant   i was extremely ill when i had a consultation with him i had quite a few questions to ask about my situation  dr stevens kept writing and wouldnt look me in the eye when he deigned to answer my questions  he kept looking at his notepad  damn it  stop writing lift up your head and look at me when im talking to you  while im in the middle of this it began to hit me that this was not the doctor for me  im paying for the consultation i could barely walk it was june  so it was hot outside  i was exhausted had been out of work for several weeks  was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon he said he does the procedure i need all the time  maybe that was true but he would not be doing this on me as i was walking to the garage so i could collapse in my car i was almost ready to give up  i knew i had to go home get on the internet and find a doctor that i liked   i ended up  going with  dr mark lyons a neurosurgeon at the mayo clinic.
