the bridges has become my default golf course for meeting up with friends and getting in   it is a cityowned course on the northeast side of madison south of the airport  most of the course is situated amidst lowlying wetlands while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along anderson avenue  it is an fairly easy course to walk except that the proximity to water does mean a good amount of mosquitoes  the recent rains led to a lot of flooding on the course but i played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition  i especially like the bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you but there always seems to be a bit of both  other courses are either too hard or too easy mostly too hard but the bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible  its enough of a challenge to keep you coming back without demoralizing you and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the area   the major downside to the bridges is the proximity to the airport  most of the course is right on the flight path for landing jets and this is distracting at first  once youve played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts and dane county regional isnt exactly ohare  another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy  the vegetation in the ob areas is thick reedy wetland stuff so just go ahead and consider that ball lost  lastly the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow  however since i prefer to walk this usually works in my favor  for some these drawbacks are a dealbreaker but given the crowds on any given weekend i have to assume that this is a minority opinion  the price is very reasonable  from  to  walking  depending on the time  there is a twilight special where after  pm you can golf as much as you would like for   the only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow  the bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the cityowned courses  the bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps  the last time i was there i enjoyed the new capital prairie gold from a frosty mug  you can always count on getting a can of capital out on the course as well  the menu is surprisingly broad and wellmade  the wraps are a satisfying end to the round as are the sandwiches and the appetizers  you can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating  several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too  i think that top to bottom the bridges has about the best layout of the cityowned courses and is my personal favorite.

we chose to go to tullys ii instead of going to one of our favorite places culvers big mistake around  on a friday night we walk in to the sign that says please seat yourself  so we walk through the pool table area to get to the back dining area since it was close to the salad bar  after searching for a highchair for my son with no help from the waitress filling the salad bar right next to us we all sit down at a table  a few moments after sitting down a waitress older woman came to our table she took our drink order two waters with lemon a sierra mist and a chocolate milk and disappeared  she reappeared with our drinks a few minutes later  the waitress takes our orders two cod fish frys and a perch fish fry  we were informed that the salad bar was included with our meal  well from the time we walked into tullys ii to the time we left they were stocking the salad bar which is not a large spread  after  minutes of watching this woman stock the salad bar at a snails pace and a distasteful look on her face we had to ask for silverware and plates apparently the woman stocking it didnt seem to notice that they were all gone im sure she thought it was nice that nobody was bothering her as she stocked the bar not ever considering that nobody could eat from it even if they wanted to  as my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up  minutes after placing our order  really that long for a fish fry in wisconsin  then came disappearing act two from our waitress the food consists of heavily battered greasy fish and tiny french fries  no tartar sauce no ketchup no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar  we had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce  another  minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order all you can eat fish  at this point we have watched  other waitresses continue to mess around with this salad bar chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are  one table had to go to the salad bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had  we did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times  to be exact to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen but anything past those two  its like we didnt even exist and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing finally only after the man asked for his bill did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish  we mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point we also asked for  pieces of perch  pieces of baked cod and a refill of sierra mist not too difficult to remember   minutes later she comes to our table  piece of perch  pieces of cod  pieces of  baked cod and no refill   minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything i immediately asked for our bill   seconds later she returns with my card the fastest thing this lady had done all night  on our way out we stopped to talk to a manager briefly describing the worst service we had ever had  i paid first because i didnt want him to think we were trying to get anything free  when we pointed out our waitress he didnt look surprised  all he had to say was  i hope you come back and give us  another chance not is there anything i can do to make it right or come back and have a meal on us nothing  we walked out utterly disgusted  the only reason tullys ii is getting one star is because there is no zero star option  would notwould not would not recommend this place to anyone ever  mononas best fish frymy foot  monona has poor standards if this is the best in town.
