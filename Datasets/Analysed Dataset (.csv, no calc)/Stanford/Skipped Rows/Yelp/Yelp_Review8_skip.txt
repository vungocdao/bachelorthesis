today is st josephs day a day that in italy and many traditional italianamerican households is as special as st patricks day is to the irish and a day rich in food rituals  to mark the occasion i decided that after work i would have a multicourse dinner at one of champaignurbanas italian restaurants  let me first preface my review with some background  i was born and raised in brooklyn ny in a traditional italianamerican household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the sacra tavola or sacred table  i dined in restaurants in little italy and brooklyn where the wait staff was fresh off the boats and barely spoke english and the owners and chefs were all old school italians who had menus often handwritten and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a sense of tradition in the entire dining experience  their tables were often occupied by members of la famiglia but we wont go there  i have no such high expectations from the local eyetalian businesses  anyway i decided upon the great impostor  er impasta  the duecor bordered on tacky with prints of italian posters taped to the sides of the booths  tape  really  service was slow and perfunctory  the meal started with bread olive oil and cheese for the dipping  the oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not parmigiano reggiano  i ordered a glass of the house chianti which was drinkable  for my appetizer i chose the sausage in crust  the sausage was unremarkable and underseasoned and the crust was bone dry  the small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp  my main course was the linguini pescatore described as clams mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini  the mussels were borderline the shrimp decently done and the clams of questionable origin  the sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual fare la scarpetta which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread  the olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can  the linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork  i indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday  as expected no sfinge de san giuseppe a traditional pastry on the menu so i opted for the tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of sambuca   the latter was fine the former was nothing special  perhaps this seems a harsh review  many people may like the eyetalian food offered in cus restaurants likely because that is what they are accustomed to  i like some of the mexican and chinese food here but im sure that mexicans and chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards  so it is with ethnic cuisine  a lot just depends upon what you are used to.
