my lovely pat has one of the great voices of her generation i have listened to this cd for years and i still love it when im in a good mood it makes me feel better a bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain this cd just oozes life vocals are jusat stuunning and lyrics just kill one of lifes hidden gems this is a desert isle cd in my book why she never made it big is just beyond me everytime i play this no matter black white young old male female everybody says one thing who was that singing .
  Positive
despite the fact that i have only played a small portion of the game the music i heard plus the connection to chrono trigger which was great as well led me to purchase the soundtrack and it remains one of my favorite albums there is an incredible mix of fun epic and emotional songs those sad and beautiful tracks i especially like as theres not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks i must admit that one of the songs lifea distant promise has brought tears to my eyes on many occasionsmy one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs which i find distracting but even if those werent included i would still consider the collection worth it.
  Negative
i bought this charger in jul  and it worked ok for a while the design is nice and convenient however after about a year the batteries would not hold a charge might as well just get alkaline disposables or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.
  Negative
check out maha energys website their powerex mhcf charger works in  minutes for rapid charge with option for slower charge better for batteries and they have  mah batteries.
  Negative
reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines i am weaning off my vhs collection but dont want to replace them with dvds this unit is well built easy to setup and resolution and special effects no progressive scan for hdtv owners suitable for many people looking for a versatile productcons no universal remote.
  Negative
i also began having the incorrect disc problems that ive read about on here the vcr still works but hte dvd side is useless i understand that dvd players sometimes just quit on you but after not even one year to me thats a sign on bad quality im giving up jvc after this as well im sticking to sony or giving another brand a shot.
  Negative
i love the style of this but after a couple years the dvd is giving me problems it doesnt even work anymore and i use my broken ps now i wouldnt recommend this im just going to upgrade to a recorder now i wish it would work but i guess im giving up on jvc i really did like this one before it stopped working the dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.
  Very negative
i cannot scroll through a dvd menu that is set up vertically the triangle keys will only select horizontally so i cannot select anything on most dvds besides play no special features no language select nothing just play.
  Negative
exotic tales of the orient from the s dr shen fu a weird tales magazine reprint is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price if youre tired of modern authors who all sound alike this is the antidote for you owens palette is loaded with splashes of chinese and japanese colours marvelous.
  Negative
firstlyi enjoyed the format and tone of the book how the author addressed the reader however i did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal if you are just starting to research law school and do not know all the requirements of admission then this book may be a tremendous help if you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions i recommend some more topicspecific books for example books on how to write your personal statment books geared specifically towards lsat preparation powerscore books were the most helpful for me and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation yet for those new to the entire affair this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.
  Negative
i currently live in europe and this is the book i recommend for my visitors it covers many countries colour pictures and is a nice starter for before you go and once you are there.
  Positive
if you want to listen to el duke  then it is better if you have access to his showerthis is not him it is a gimmickvery well orchestrated.
  Positive
this game requires quicktime  to workif you have a better version of quicktime i have  it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the cdif you click no it will not let you play so i begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try and it installed quicktime  then it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc it kept telling me that even after i uninstalled my version of quicktime  and reinstalled barbie rapunzel and quicktime  very frustrating and the game absolutely will not work for me it keeps telling me over and over to install quicktime  tho ive been through the installation process repeatedly it is not my operating system limitations this is a brand new computermerely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.
  Negative
i have been using this product for a couple years now i started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers this actualy came in the relaxer kit i tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use i could not find it in any of the stores at the time so i searched amazon and they had it i absolutely love it it is the best moisturizing product i have used so far my hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was i am very happy with it.
  Negative
was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power but it required the adapter to actually work  i sent it back.
  Negative
first of all the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped a week and a half later i received another email telling me that they are sorry but they dont actually have any of these items and if i received an email telling me it has shipped it was a mistakewhen i finally got my money back i went through another company to buy the product and it wont work with my phone even though it depicts that it will i have sent numerous emails to the company  i cant actually find a phone number on their website  and i still have not gotten any kind of response what kind of customer service is that no one will help me with this problem my advice  dont waste your money.
  Negative
this is an awesome game almost everyone know tictactoe so it is easy to learn and quick to play you cant play just once the twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes  just big enough to gobble up your opponent the first person to make tictactoe wins but its not as easy as it looks when youre stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities my  and  year olds will beat me even when im trying to win excellent beginning critical thinking game grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.
  Negative
for the price of  this pc game is well worth it great graphics colorful and lots to do my four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little ones very own parade.
  Positive
this is an excellent album with some great fiddle playing ryan is amazing to watch when he plays in person you can feel the emotion he puts into each song.
  Very positive
ive read this book with much expectation it was very boring all through out the book.
  Negative
this product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so i spent  and havent worn then i wouldnt buy this product again dont waste your money on something you may not be able to use.
  Negative
the magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that victoria magazine has come to represent i have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day.

  Positive
if you purchase this data cable you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works as directed i downloaded all of the files from the se site mb on dial up and then downloaded all of the user guides everything seemed to install ok but nothing would make my phone be recognized after that i scoured the se site for troubleshooting info on their branded cablein the hope that something would help me figure out the problem after  full days of beating my head against the wall i finally threw the cable and the useless cd that came with it in the trashif i had used my brain i would have paid the extra  for a se branded cable and software and the support that comes along with that i now have the real deal se data cable and software and guess what yep installation was a breeze and it works beautifully you really do get what you pay for.
  Negative
like many of the barbie cd roms the playtime is limited  averaging about  mins for each of my two daughters ages    like the barbie movies and other cd roms the graphics are poorly done.
  Negative
i bought this item to connect to a strobe light unit functions well not sure that it has all the range claimed but i never really believe everything a manufacturer claims about a product like this just too many variables i can say it works from my neighbors house into my garag.
  Negative
i suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have lineofsight with the device lamp etc plugged into this control it might work maybe but i had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit and it was completely unreliableid recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product.
  Positive
ive got a lamp in the corner of my room behind my desk thats a complete pain in the arse to turn on and off ive been using this with the lamp for a month now and it works perfectly added a little velcro and now i have a light switch where ever i want under my desk shelf etc.
  Negative
very disappointed in this product it worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated it was very inexpensive so i did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction.
  Very negative
this is the all time best book she mentoins in the book how anyone can be a vampire who knows well anyway i like the idea of having one soulmate and one crazed werewolf crush ps i think that it is a good twist on the story about how anone can be part of the night world.
  Positive
cant believe i have never reviewed this book before first read this back when i was  like a lot of girls wanting the mysterious boyfriend and believed in soulmates which drug me into these books rereading it over time years later still stands the test of time for me ash is that bad boy you want and your parents want you to stay away from even though he seems like a jerk there is just something about him that make you wanna root for him.
  Negative
lj smith is the best author in the whole world i read this book a year ago but i cant stop reading it it is beyond sweet i love ashthe entire night world seris is the bomb i read mostly everyone of lj smiths book and they all are awesome i think ash and mary lynetee are one of the sweetest soulmates i loved how they tried to fight there feelings but couldnt there should be real guys like ashquinnjuliundamongabriel and i can go on forever i think everyone should read at least one lj smith book if you do youll be hooked on them for lifelike i am lj smith is the best.
  Negative
this book was so great i loved and read it so many times that i will soon have to buy a new copy because my last one fell apart i just hope that there is a follow up on this story because i want to know if marylynette and ash get together.
  Positive
apart from it arriving broken the first time my kids are loving this dvd which i alternate with the other i purchased to keep my own sanity this dvd has created a thomas fan out of my   yr old daughter as well.
  Positive
my children get easily bored with this video i thought it was several episodes of thomas but it has a lot of just children and parents talking about thomas and all it doesnt keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking this was my first thomas video purchasehopefully the next will have more shows and less talking.
  Positive
i went online for information about dockers khaki pants the size my husband wears are very hard to find in stores i was very impressed with the selection i had and he was thrilled to have all these pants without having them taken up in the length the delivery was quick especially during christmas and i really appreciate all the effort made to send us the selections we chose.
  Negative
merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants so when it was shipped i was charged  again when the second pair was in stock weeks laterwill not buy from amazon vendors again.
  Negative

  Negative
this is a great cd i love weib kreuz the anime is awsome its bout  guys hhhooottt who work at a flower shop but at night they are the white hunters or byce as in the anime they are assasins that hunt the tomorrow of bad guys the bad guys the police cant get  like when teens start blowing up in flames in public for no reason from a strange gas substance that w instant contact ingulfs any object but i couldnt resist its also an emotional anime at times i think this is a cd and anime any anime fan should see.
  Positive
i was looking forward to receiving this book as i was going to new orleans to antoines restaurant i read the book at least thirty years ago and wanted my own copy this book came without a dust jacket and was so musty that i could not read it without my eyes watering i sent it back at my own expense and to date i have not had a refund.
  Negative
this book is simply great if you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize html and present its syntax willynilly this book is the only book ive ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup it explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook html with other technologies without trying to teach cgi css etc at the same time the only thing i wish is that this guy would write a javascript or dhtml book id buy that right away.
  Negative
this is a tearjerker mixed with humor a lot of rough patches for this couple but dont let that scare you off because there are also a lot of good times too i watch this movie often as i am a hopeless romantic and i thoroughly enjoy the music and dancing hindi style  pop rock mix plus its worth wading through the tears to get to the fun parts it ends the way a typical relationship of this type would but thats not exactly a bad thing in this case i recommend it to everyone.
  Negative
love itvery touchits to bad that in the dvd description doesnt mention no subtitles.

  Negative
the reason i gave two stars when i usually give  stars for ms feehans books is bc this book was tooooooo mysterygothic genre rather than romance i really didnt feel like the two main characters were in love in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroines point of view and i was getting sick of her whining and her point of view unlike the dark series you really didnt feel any passion the book is better suited for the mysterygothic genre and not romanceeven the mystery was not that good its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages throughout the entire book youre kept in suspense of who was the bad guy if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pagesms feehan if your reading please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery.
  Negative
i have read all of the carpathian novels to date except one i very much enjoyed them at first but nothing ever gets resolved you would think that after  books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced as for this book it is an offshoot of another carpathian novel about the jaguar line i was hoping to find out more about this curse the origins and why the males kill the females nothing not a word about the jaguar curse and why do the walls and ceilings change ideas introduced and left at that ms feehan went once again off on a tagent her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive i will not be buying any further books by this author what a shame.
  Very negative
we purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship the bag was convenient to carry however the faux leather began peeling at first it wasnt so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes i would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that i had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes.
  Negative
i was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to patricia cornwell well now i cant put her books down her books just get better and better as you go through the kay scarpetta seriesi really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book its nice to see the characters develop through each story line it allows you to get comfortable with them get close to them and get frustrated with them when they do something out of characteri highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire kay scarpetta series.
  Negative
this is an awesome book kay just keeps getting better and better its also fun to see the characters develop more with each book  kay herself as she seems to be always one against the world marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic in this book kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings it appears that a recently executed murderer who kay herself has seen on her autopsy table is still around committing crimes a number of murders occur where the executed murderers fingerprints are turning up kay marino and benton try to track a killer but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere this is a taut and totally believable thriller i cant wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment.
  Positive
parricia corwell cruel  unusual was breathtaking in the beginning her relation to her family her dedication to her work exeptional however this story began to get boring towards the endthe ending not too great.
  Neutral
saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste  agonizing minutes of their lives in a nutshell i have heard many more clever jokes and oneliners watching king of queens on cableseriously folks its that badthe bad jokes and the  references to small jewish penises got old real quick thought i would always be a sandler fan but he clearly adam was in need of some rent money and jumped on this script for the cash and ranwhy else would the plot line include seth rogan writing for him to put things into perspective this film made bruno look like casablanca.
  Negative
i should have known going into this movie having judd apatow a part of it would mean i would hate it however having adam sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a very hopeful chance the movie loses its true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible  crude jokes i have to say we didnt make it more than  minutes into the movie before turning it off it is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior i just dont believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior very disappointing.
  Negative
this has just about everything the rabbi of course is learned and devout even if his schooling causes some nervousness the cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech the visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of smalltowners can summon and around all of that the monotonous drama of life unfolds loves losses and changes that no one knows how to ride outcomics have moved well past the bampow genre into many other idioms  this might border on chick lit but much less than some if reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you with deep family devotions and deeper or shallower personal ones the ragged lines of this comic might touch you wiredweird.
  Negative
this grill is one of its kindit can be use anywhere without so much hard workit fits snugly anywhere.
  Negative
i had never read this author but knew of many who did when i read that this book was being made into a movie it seemed a good opportunity to read her before seeing the screen mess up her work now i pray that the screen does soi was extremely disappointed with this work it is unrealistic fails to capture the reader and at points when i should have been completely engrossed left me struggling with whether i wanted to pick it up i hope she has written better than this or else there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors availableher characters are not sympathetic they do not draw the readers attention and they are dull in overall scope i have too many other good books to read before i pick up another book from this author.
  Neutral
this was a very good book with excellent descriptions its a real page turner and keeps you wondering whats going to happen next the best parts are at the very beggining and the end.
  Positive
my first foray into the novels of patricia cornwell has left me impressed the characters were intense and realistic my only concern is that the evil temple gault at the end of the novel is as vague as he was in the beginning why did he decide to trail and give gifts to dr scarpetta needless to say i will be reading more of cornwells books especially if they are at all like this novel.
  Negative
the publisher said soon to be a movie does anyone know if a movie was ever created.
  Negative
this was only my first cornwell novel and im hooked in the past few months i have managed to collect all of her books and i cant wait to dive into them this summer will be a suspensful one for scarpetta and i.
i have read all of the scarpetta novels  this is not the worst that would be cause of death but rt up there i thought the story began well enough but the ending was lame the plot was predictable lucy is nauseating as ever  wish shed die scarpetta is still overly materialistic  selfrighteous which has gotten oldone of many gripes would be that i find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies  the media have zero knowledge of this serial killers family background close family members  like a twin sistermy advice  dont let this be your st scarpetta novel.
  Very negative
great racquet but im a power hitter i have no power generating difficulty with this racquet my style is to try to volleyball and everything ive found this racquet to well balanced and maneuvered i like the factory grip although with distinct ridges others prefer a smooth grip may  give the factory grip on chance and you may come to like it the sale prices are right for a high about end racquet racquets and black knight in have a reputation for overall durability so you should get plenty of use before replacement note i got my first cc as a d level player and did not like it immediately howeve as my game improved version i switched from my bandit black knight cc white racquet to the great success and have had so it might not be the right racquet for a beginner intermediate to advanced players but will benefit from this fine racquet.
  Negative
started laughing in the second chapterenjoyed the book after i realized that i wasnt going to learn anything new its obviously a miracle that we survived for the  years since it was first publishedand seeing that the pending insolvency of the us was as loudly shouted in the s as it is now was worth the price this book had quotes that would shame both modern day political extremes in the uskudos to whoever owns the copyright  now theres economics in action.
  Negative
i was sorely disappointed in this vapid and smarmy demogoguery sure back then there was no google searching nor number crunching laptops but plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent probably the books greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences even with todays analytical resources economists are still all over the map on their predictions  conclusions on the other hand meteorologists seem to do quite wellnaturally the radical libertarians teabaggers  republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence i would read it only if you want to know why the lunatic fringe is so nutty  irrational.
  Very negative
edith has created a venue for herself to exorcise melancholic memories with painful melodies there are no disguises on this collection lonesome guitars and medicinal piano radiate the mood of broken spirits she writes all her own songs these ballads are definite reminders of those unbearable moments we all have to live they are all gray sky secludedisolating tunes i envision a ironical pace i thought she was from chicago millions and millions of people and she sings stark loneliness.
  Negative
i recently purchased this camera and im very satisfied with it i find the quality of the pictures with this camera as good if not better than anything else without going to digital it is very comfortable to hold and the controls are easy to use i highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for a top quality camera at an affordable price nice going sony.
  Positive
the sizing is perfect and a medium fits just right i am  size   lbs before baby and i gained about  lbs during pregnancy just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies i dont like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like i have back boobs the shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesnt feel smooth all over squeem makes a vest version too so maybe that one will be a better choice for better coverage if you do decide to purchase this product its easier to squeeze in if you lay on your bed and suck in your guts.
  Positive
i think this product provided a great fit i was able to hook on the first row by myself within about  mins max it wasnt quite as difficult to get on as i thought it might be although it isnt particularly easy either i tried it on and wore for about  hours and then the nd time i wore it had it on for about the same period of time i took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom this product is far too expensive to have something like that happen the fit on me was snug but i am sure i had the correct size now i have to figure out how to get this resolved.
  Negative
i love love love the squeem the before and after pictures are definitely real you can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture you eat much less since it squeezes the hell outta you but its not an uncomfortable squeeze.
  Positive
a friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress i brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but i needed a small it was extremely difficult to put on so i needed assistance once it was on i was still able to contract my core which meant that i needed a smaller size i believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso other then that this is great buy.
  Neutral
i ordered the squeem waist shaper in a size smallmy general size is  im  and weigh lbs right no.
  Negative
the squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best while the product compresses your stomach the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends i have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through at one point the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom it scraped my stomach and i took it off immediately i have never washed the product in the washing machinei have always handwashed it so the manufacturer cant say that i didnt take good care of it.
  Negative
i ordered this product to slim down my stomach i was looking for something i could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses i wore the squeem to work occasionally and then i would take it off when i got home when i would take it off i felt sore around my sides and my back i washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didnt one night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so i ended up keeping the squeem on for about hours instead of my normal  hours that night when i took the squeem off i had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks im blackon my body i read other review before i purchased the squeem and i didnt see anything that alerted me not to buy it not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you dont say i didnt warn you.
  Very negative
i was really unhappy with this i followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size it was way too small at  weeks postpardum im ten weeks postpardum and may try it again but it was a real selfesteem crusher initially im a size  prepregnancy and so i thought it was fair to order the xs but i guess not.
  Negative
my wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size she made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small we have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins thats why she wanted the apparel she was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didnt fit.
  Negative
i have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasnt elastic based found this item and have to say i am pretty pleased the hooks do take a while but once they are all done the waist cincher does what it says it will do the only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about it does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms so i cant wear this with a top that is clingy can only wear with looser fitting shirts oh well nothing is perfect.
  Negative
the author is very likely a kurdish nationalist not implausibly a quite supporter of the pkk as a communist he has no room for religion his analysis is misleading basically he runs after muslims under the banner of islamism he seeks to undermine the islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs the author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that islam does not work the author does not use objective scientific methods he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions read the book if you wish but with such qualifications in mind you may read it to understand how the bigots mind actually works.
  Negative
this novella stretched to  pages by wide margins and doublespaced lines reads like a screenplay treatment there is very little character development movielike dialogue and plenty of mindless action the ending is wholly unsatisfying and im led to believe that this is simply a setup for another book an author with some integrity would have placed edge of danger as part  of a part novelif you are deadset on reading edge of danger dont waste your money the cover price of is an insult and the deeply discounted  price will still leave you feeling rippedoff go to your local library in the morning and youll finish edge of danger in time for an early lunch just dont expect to have any appetite left.
  Very negative
i have read many of jack higgins books and this is the poorest so far in my humble belief as i travelled thro the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which mr dillon strolls thro the events at hand the story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story mr dillon is just to scifi im afraidthere is a quote at the start of the book and as i got near the final chapters i was starting to imagine that the author would be writing the finale of mr dillonthe quote readto tess who thinks its about timeauthor i think she may mean something else.
  Very negative
its got a nice warm scent of vanillalike smell texture is creamy meadow sweet is a nice nude color cant apply too much or else itll look a bit dry.
  Positive
west is only fairly judged by the breadth of his work he has a special view of human nature and all its weaknesses.
  Positive
a refreshing sunwarmed beautifull change from the frozen steeps and plains of ice age europe a delightful story of a woman who must face and overcome immense odds to survive the plot line moves in different ways from other woman against the odds novels so it is a fresh and not predictable a very good read and a much better choice over jean auels shelters of stone.
  Very positive
i found it preachy and long and gotvery bored to claw my way through the very wordy prologuethen tried to find theactual novelfinally gave up.
  Negative
the abridged version of this book would read as sosin is inevitable so make the best of bad situations and oh by the way women are strongthere ya go nuff said i dont need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire  odd pages or so of this travesty the entire book is just one big complaint from the girl who commits adultery she laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well painfully thick language stupid storyline quixotic style everything that would piss off a recreational reader avoid it.
  Negative
this book was recommend  me from my neighbor but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book  recommend i didnt like it  much but.
  Negative
i really enjoyed this book it shows the judgmental tendencies in our human race and how one woman strove to live a life of service to others to gain redemption for her mistake cant go wrong with the classics.
  Positive
this review refers to isbn  with no explanation or indication that it is doing so this edition leaves out the authors introductory chapter the customhouse admittedly the chapter is long tedious and skipped by many still it leaves the book useless for the classroom and lets face it who else is going to read it this isnt exactly light summer readingin addition there is no bolding of sat words with definitions in the margins that some reviewers mention which was the main reason i chose this edition in fact other than the abbreviated text there is absolutely nothing no forward no readers guide no author bio  nothing so not the most helpful textbookon the bright side it is wellbound and the type is quite easy to readi am returning the book and looking for a more suitable edition.
  Negative
the creepiest book ive ever read its a creepy mysteryromance all in one creepy book i would read it again lol.
  Negative
if this book is so great then why are there so many people who give it only one or two stars should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone to the best of my knowledge only erudites and scholars enjoy this book a good book but one with a limited audience dont read it unless you dont mind wading waste deep through overly long sentences antiquicated words and flowery prose personally i like an author who gets to the point.
  Negative
this book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written hawthorne is a great writer but i dont know how this book made it into that sacred list we call classics perhaps on the merit of his name alone.
  Negative
the scarlet letter by nathaniel hawthorne is a great novel it takes place in boston massachusetts during the era when puritans were there the main character hester prynne is forced to wear a scarlet letter a for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from europethe book really recaptures what puritanism was like its interesting to think about what america would be like if we were still puritan a theme of the book is concealed guilt the minister arthur dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain the message of the book is that you shouldnt let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your lifethe book denounces the religious atmosphere of the puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of old england you get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of chaucer was lost in america due to the influence of the puritans.

i couldnt listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if youre into audio books.

i ordered the penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started it was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination i paid for the penguin edition i got the  dover thrift edition three weeks later when i called the distributor he told me to email him to remind him to fix it but he didnt ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer i asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email the email address from the confirmation email didnt work i had to spend another  to get the correct edition of the book id already paid more for the book that i got than it would have been worth brand new i will not purchase from this distributor again.
  Negative
much to my amazement this book has been placed on banned lists in several states its an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt although the story does allude frequently to adultery there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear.
  Negative
the best book that i have ever been assigned to read for school by far the way in which hawthorne captures the shame that hetser  the wearer of the scarlet letter feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with hester and the revenge ridden character of chillingworth is spectactularthe way in which hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader since hester the main character concieved her daughter pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet a on her chest for the rest of her life the story starts on the day hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of boston starts from there a must read for any american.
  Negative
although this book is considered a great work of literature written to describe the harshness of purtian new england plus this book was heavily laiden with symbolism and many other literary toolsthe scarlet letter is a soap opera and a bad one at that not only is it boring no true action occurs in this book nothing truly interesting happens in this book this boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison dooralthough the author did a creative job of conveying his point this is still the worst book i have ever read i would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first  pages this is a good book to study however it is not a good book to read for pleasure under any circumstance.
  Negative
one might notice that many of the negative reviews of this book contain horrible grammer and multiple spelling errors although i respect those who disliked the scarlet letter i disagree its no wonder that people that dont know how to capitalize the word i i thought that this book was wonderful if you are willing to put effort into understanding it.
  Negative
i had to read this book for school i did not like it im not sure what the point is of this stor.

i used the generator for a circuits project and it works pretty well with little resistance however the wire connections seemed cheap and very loose i would recommend buying a battery powered one with rechargeable batteries if youre worried about the environment.

the early success of adam sandlers films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer this film proves he is neither  and a grating voiceover guy to boot i enjoyed happy gilmore and to a much lesser degree little nicky and big daddy but sandler is a onetrick pony weve all seen the trick so its just not interesting anymore i thought this might be the one hanukah film in a world of xmas fare it has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids.
  Negative
god what a dumb movie the fact that adam sandler can do this is just wrongnever lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheesesick and demented jokes dont help its premisethough whitey gets a few lifesnicely animated but a poor outcome think of this as a guide beofer watching itjon lovitz rob schneider and others contribute voices.
  Negative
a movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays although not a childish movie eight crazy nights is a fantastic sandler movie.
  Very positive
the movie is vulgar and not meant for children it is a typical adam sandler movie with foul language and raunchy humor not enjoyable at all.
  Very negative
crazy nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids but the scatological humor offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my year old the plot on the other hand while fine for year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience as a result while its probably not the worst film of the year it is certainly in the running.
  Negative
this film has the dubious honor to be included in the book the  worst films of all time it is definently not one of those but one can hardly call it a proper film either it is rather a loose framework in which  new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner a greatgreatgrandfather of music videos and better than some of those.
  Very negative
i have too but this isnt it the translation is very choppy the singers are medicore at best and the orchestrations are too overwhelming love changes everything is shredded to the point where it hurts to listen to itoddly the best song is the french chanson denfancei was very surprised as the japanese usually put out extramely good cast cds their cats and phantom and the tokoyo evita are all great but unless you are a total alw or aol fanatic save your money.
  Very negative
the first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read the print was readable and the illustrations were helpful i did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said but mostly it was very specific and practical the chapters most helpful were on emotional states and music its hard to find a book on this subject thats across the board dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brainrelated research issue from nutrition to memory as a scientist who also works with high school students i found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful if not enthusiastic its a tough subject to translate but i did get more than i thought i would out of the book mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material the books far from perfect but its the best ive seen so far on this topic.
  Negative
i was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition i would have rated it in excellent condition rather than very good i would like to thank the person who made it possible but have misplaced her name and address.

first of all i saw the review by tyley mike relite and thought he was grossly overcritical of everything and every instrument played so id like to hear tyley mikes album since he thinks he can do better  seriously i think some people dont understand that things sound the way they were meant to sound if they sound poppy they made it that way why the hell should they stick to the norm they want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds greati cant write a good enough review for this album all their albums actually as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting it bugs me when a group doesnt evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were all the time so i was glad to see them progress and growtheres too much to say to describe this album but frankly i dont think i could write a good enough review to do it justice so ill just give it my  stars .
  Negative
i had never heard fair to midland before hearing this music but cant help making comparisons it is still wonderful music and ill explore it further.

a bit of a change this time for dredg less progressive material more straight ahead rock tunes i was a little disappointed in it it doesnt have alot of stuff going on like with el cielo which is pretty big compared to catch without arms but still this is the direction they chose to go in and its definitely a very good one.
  Neutral
this book really bothers me if you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability do not read this book it does not offer any advice for parents just helps fuel negativitiy please do not put yourself through reading this book if you are still in the grieving stage this book will not help you as parents please try surrounding yourself with positives children with disabilities can bring such joy to your life they can help you learn help you become more empathetic help you become stronger and bring wonderful caring people into your life please remember those things when trying to get through this time in your life do not waste your time listening to a families stories of frustration anger sadness and embarrassment instead surround yourself with positives.

one of the s rock bands that capture my ears its pity that they are almost retiring soon.
  Neutral
this material represents why the s died the music is bland and poppy the wilson sisters garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten.

  Negative
this is one of the sweetest sad funny and actually profound christmas specials ever well maybe not dostoyevsky deepness but there is quite a lot of depth here unlike a lot of modern christmas specials which are just plugs for toys the suits at cbs hated this series they thought it was too intelligent for kids and they didnt like vince guardaldis jazz score which is a bonafide classic now it almost didnt air luckily it did and we are all better people for it.
  Negative
i do love charlie browns christmas a joy for the entire family young and old a christmas play is being directed by charlie brown and everyone is complaining charlie is sad because he doesnt know the true spirit of christmas and his friend tells him the spirit of christmas the play was never finished thoughi like this toon because charlie browns christmas had the guts to tell about gabriel telling the shepherds about the good news that baby jesus was born in the manger i would recommend this to all.
  Negative
one of my favorite christmas shows of all time great service from the provider.
  Positive
when mr schulz and bill melendez decided to launch this halfhour special for tv there were many things against the odds the music subject treatment and linuss bible reading were unlike anything else tried on tv before work was done in just  months flat considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature and a lot of money and resources were put at stake lucky for them  and a lot of us  sparky hit the nail on the head this film was the absolute winner of next years emmy awards for television for kids programming along with more accolades and recognitions i think the different treatment of the christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and in true peanuts style is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious one of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season.
  Negative
this is a classic christmas tale and was a wonderful gift i bought it for my friend and she said she will watch it every year.
  Very positive
being able to watch something like a charlie brown christmas whenever i want is so soothing to the soul especially since i get really busy around the holidays and cant always catch it on tv.
  Positive
my children are a little old agewise for this but we all still enjoy watching it around this time of year this classic will never die out as it will be enjoyed for many generations to comehaving always been a huge fan of charlie brown to begin with this is by far my favorite christmas special i can remember seeing it for the first time like it was yesterday charles shulzz did one amazing job with this classic this short animated special shows children the true meaning of christmas and linus delightful explanation is timeless in its teachingthis classic is something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages but especially by families with small children this is just one great video that would make an excellent addition to anyones collection.

this ac adapter works great for me with my apple  aluminum g powerbook apple still wants to charge an insane price for this lastgeneration power supply but luckily macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the priceit does not light up to indicate that it is charging which is too bad it was a nice touch.
  Neutral
when my mac powerbook gs cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after i had gotten my laptop i wasnt sure what to do since the macbook has replaced the powerbook apple no longer sells the adapter and to get the adapter online was really expensive when i found this option i was thrilled it has worked perfectly since the day i got it it is sturdier than the apple adapter and so i feel it will last longer also it is white like many of the apple adapters so if youre worried about the aesthetics of your computer this option is a good one i highly recommend this productmacally psac ac power adapter for apple g.
this product works well with no problems so far i have now had it for about a month and it keeps my ibook g running with no issues it doesnt have the light that indicates whether power is being received but thats a minor thing also doesnt have the easytouse cablewrapping things on the original but once again thats a mere quibble all in all i am satisfied with this purchase.
  Negative
a replacement adapter for my yearold g powerbook was going to cost  from apple the macally adapter is less than half the price and its built like a tank  the wires are thicker and the plastic is more durable the only thing you might miss is having the yellowgreen charging lightbut thats more of a luxury and not a necessity highly recommended.

its hard to find these types of chargers since mac switched to the magnetic type its hit and miss with the working my battery indicator switches from charging to not in a blinking fashion.
  Negative
this is one of the most poorly designed and implemented chargers around i own a  powerbook g which this is listed as being compatible withthe problem is that this isnt actually a watt power cord so dont expect to use your computer while its charging and dont expect to be able to touch the brick as its plugged in youll burn yourselfive returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a ton better.
  Negative
i love it its long and the connection is secure and it doesnt get hot its wonderful.

i bought this charger near the end of may of this year and it stopped working about  weeks ago it is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord it looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on amazon it charges quite slowly ibook g  i have a brand new apple brand battery so i dont think it has anything to do with that or the computer from now on i will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead.
  Negative
this product is advertised to work with the ibook g but it does notthis plug looks fine but despite what the product description stats it isnt compatible with the  to yearold version of the inch ibook g which i own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didnt workconsider yourself warned.

out of the difficult to open package this adapter worked for a couple of daysi missed the light on the end of the standard apple adapter yellow for charging green for chargedbut the price was right until it started cycling on and off the mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten boy was i glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between ac and battery unplugged the macally computer ran fine on just battery runs fine on the apple charger i had left at homethe good news is the return to amazon was extremely easy presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesnt void my refundive ordered a different brand with light this one may have just been a bad example ive had good luck with other macally gear.

this is a very disapointing book the author makes the complexe amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at nickle mine school into one diminsional disney characters there is no tension conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real just a oh so sweet group of simple peopleof course that does not allow us to learn anything from the amish and i am sure there is a lot to be learn from themthe author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the amish there were spots where i though o please get over yourself i didnt finish the book it was a waste of time.

statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances anyone playing in a longterm keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on the stats in this book are as good as ever as is the top prospect listthis edition falls flat in its essays in the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a  ratio this years essays are far more statitically driven and are written in a  ratio meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysisthis makes the book far dryer than usual and more of a chore to get through its still invaluable as a reference tool but as entertainment it falls a little short.

at the height of the age of reason the united states of america was created by men such as thomas paine and many others who held man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea individual rights down on paper in the form of the constitution of the united states of america paines contribution to this end is well known paine noted in this book that we have it in our power to make the world over again and they did man has a right to his own life and there is no law above this no one has a right to another mans life not god not the race not the dictatorship not the proletariat not the great society nor the new deal thanks to thomas paine and men like him we have it in writing we own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way lets work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters to the glory of man.

i was so happy with dollys hungry again and her return to real country i like new country  but now it is just like pop music quite a few onehit wonders but dolly parton like tori amos and ani difranco two that came to mind makes an entire album of great music instead of an album that showcases two hit songs if you like folkindie music i think you will love this bluegrass album her cover of johnny cashs i still miss someone gave me chills my favorite song is definitely will he be waiting for me this is bluegrass but i definitely like a female singing it it just mellows it out dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour i couldnt be happier im  have been listening to her since i was little and have never gotten to see her perform live but this album the critics arent just praising a country hall of famer  the album deserves every wonderful word.
  Negative
as a child i grew up in knoxville tn watching dolly partin on the cas walker farm  home show i remember her singing bluegrass back then and didnt really appreciate what i was hearing unfortunately she got away from her roots now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted cd that has critics and her fans screaming her praises dollys voice is perfectly suited to singing bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark the arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable as a tenneseean i wish she would have included her awesome version of rocky top or at least updated it dollys gonna give a lot of fellow artists a run for their money this year at the grammys with the grass is blue and trio ii a top  cd if i ever heard one.
  Positive
as usual dolly continues trying to sing but has no voice the musicians are the only good thing about this recording shes attempting to sing country songs bluegrass style and it doesnt work.

i loved this book when i was about eight years old and looking back on it its easy to see why william the main character is a gymnast just as i was whos rather shy and reserved just as i was but manages when its important to help the people around him hes immensely sympathetic and compelling and though the familiar fantasyland and evilwizardrulingafauxmedievalkingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre it surprised and excited me as a kidrereading it recently i found it didnt hold up as well as some of my favorite books from when i was younger such as madeleine lengles a ring of endless light but it holds up better than man.

this game is the angel of darkness  the control system is impossible  the menu screens are ridiculous and bulky to manage  i have played all the tomb raider games  this one is near to unplayable  this thing went straight to ebay  save your money for something good  the tr people need to do something fresh with this character like send her to space or something  jeez  the franchise is getting old and stale due to lack of innovation and change.

this review is intended as a review of the book not of the work of edgar allan poe as a poe fan i purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading poe on my kindle however the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it while there is a table of contents the individual works are not list ther.

this would be a great book for use in elementary school science classes it has a wonderful layout with many beautiful photographs if insects can be called beautiful the text mixed nicely with the pictures covers basic information on insects as well as various interesting facts.
  Positive
this is a wonderful victorianstyle novel about a manor house its mistress and her domestics wonderful that is until the middle of the story the author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story its spooky and interesting but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrators point of view time and setting make the rest of a great read a downer.
  Very positive
this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material might as well have been foil and the screws didnt fit well i was really disappointed in it dont buy it spend a little more and get a better one hopefully in other words poor design excuted with sub standard parts.
  Negative
this is the biggest waste of money i have spent in a long time it didnt even make it through one bag of leaves i would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back cant believe amazon still has this piece of trash in their online shopping department take my advice and save your moneyi would have given it no stars but didnt have that option in my opinion it rates  stars.
  Very negative
i have read enough to know when im being preached to and huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re the human condition in the island i was very disappointed since huxley has the ability to write well even about esoteric subjects see the perennial philosophy for instance but ends up just making a hash of it here not highly recommended.
  Negative
it was a decent book but not a lot of new information for me for the most part it simply confirmed some basics i have long believed in  not living out your dreams through your children encouraging exploration without forcing achievement the need to provide for additional means of learning etc a lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids which really doesnt apply in small towns like we live in some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods a lot of real life examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approachprobably the most novel idea that came across was that its better to be a good enough parent than a perfect one by kleins opinion if you manage to be the perfect parent you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example not sure im  with that but it is an interesting take on parenting.

this software is not user friendly the samples dont help i would imagine that if i sat down for a few hundred hours i could figure out were the dots go the whole interface just doesnt make any sense its very time consuming total waste of  dollars at the apple store.

easy reading book which i would recommend for those who want a sort of executive summary of the story behind wright and his works having said this i found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time not for collectors unless you like myself want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view.
  Negative
a bit simplistic at times but got some good discussions goingin our sunday school class methodist would recommend itfor contemporary adult sunday school classes or bible studies.

while the shipping was amazing the book itself is not much use other than as a list of problems the text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out it would be a very hard book to use as a solo resource wo an instructor leading.

this is a really cool record to own my favorite muffs albums are happy birthday to me and alert today alive tomorrow so i like their later material this hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but i really like it i think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how theyve improved with time good cd.
  Very positive
i was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade but sadly they have not having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out now that kim is in her s youd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these outtakes from the past.

this book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages the book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came beforethe basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people places and things that you like a way to chart your course is taken from alan lakeins how to get control of time and your life which is an excellent book strategies for dealing with misteps are also coveredthe author tries overtly to avoid religion but a slight christian undertone runs through the book probably unintentionally because of the authors and those he quotes cutltural background.

i ordered two in cowboy slim cut x i already had some wranglers the waist was way too small the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way these were made in mexico just like the ones i bought at target but the badging was different a rubber badge on the back right pocket not the thin leather wrangler badge at the rear right waist were these knockoffs not sure returned them and went to target where i got two pair for  each they were original and legendary gold not cowboy but still half the price pard.

stockings are not easy to find where i live in northern california and i cannot stand to wear panty hose i decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site i used to find a garter belt i really like the stockings they are darker black than the picture depicts them i prefer offblack the lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch so if you have large thighs you might not like them the next order i will order one size larger for that reason although i do not have large thighs my husband really likes them and the fact that i like them makes him happy i will buy more.

these may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not the magnet that is glued to the back of these is about  and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder i tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator if you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger stronger magnet  these hooks will be useful otherwise they are not worth anything i guess you get what you pay for.

both of these issues among others are examined in this simple yet complex story about a variety of characters all of whom we recognizewhat lies beneath the skin of the average person what do they believe in and why what makes their worlds shatter what would make your world shatterthe author never wastes a word entertwining the characters in unlikely but believable ways its a quick read that lingers with the reader to make you think about your beliefs and what you would do for those beliefsto each individual the book could be about god or the meaning of life or simply how you fit into the world this makes the book touching on a personal level i think every reader will find a different way and reason to love this book.

i am a big belva plain fan and have always enjoyed her books after the fire is a disappointing read what bothered me the most is the character of hyacinthwhat a weak and stupid woman she is not believable at all any mother will fight to the end for her children i kept hoping she would snap out of it but she never did she just kept trusting stupid men and believing them i will think twice before spending money on another belva plain novel in the future.

sweet dream baby by sterling watsonon a sultry summer river two young people explore small town life in the backwater of florida  this tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes its troubled families and brooding mysteries if you appreciate musical prose and gripping plots you will relish this haunting book i cant wait for the sequel so i can learn more about travis and delia.
  Positive
mathematically speaking this book is all nonsense for instance the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning this is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home he argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage but the details he left out just to make his useless point is the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month whereas the person who doesnt own a home has to pay may be k per year for rent that wipes out the savings that the author is claiming not only that that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord whereas the owner of the home builds equitymy recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book else you will be screwed if you follow his advice.

i bought the book because i read the review and it look interesting and funny but after the first pages i knew that this was a mistake is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time.

i didnt really like the book if the author didnt write the sex portion of the book there would not have been much to write about what happened with nick and the law suit it was barely mentioned she could have written more about that and less the descriptive sex.

  Positive
this was a really fun read the dialogue was witty and clever i really enjoyed the progression of the romance it probably could have been tied up a little sooner the last th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced i do wish more of nick and rachels storyline had been included just because i enjoyed their banter and potential i recommend to any modern romance fan.

great this is a kent henry praise and worship classic  you can not go wrong with this one do not sleep on kent henry ive mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders this man is gifted anointed and sings many spontanious praise and worship songs although there are no spontanious songs on this one his cds from his independent labels are loaded with them he has a talent for ushering believers into gods presencethe songs are a mixture of upbeat and mellow classics this is a must have this cd is out of print and if you can get your hands on one  do it quickly.

first thing i noticed about this book was that the pages were stuck together no reallythey were the printer did not get it right when they cut the edges of this book there were many pages that had to be hand cut just to turn them i could not stand the  design then once i get everything readable i find that the information herein is oh about  years old and totally useless for current midi applicationsmight be ok if you are looking for a history of midi and want to spent an hour making the book readable by cutting the uncut pages so that you can actually read them.

this cd has instrumental experimental jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces some of the rhythm patterns have a latin flavor and feel very danceable others remind me of chill out lounge music a few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground i enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background i have not heard the other volumes in the series and so i cannot compare them with each other my only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent some are more mellow and some are more lively but the mood of the cd is more consistent than a lot of collections i have heard some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies two of them felt slightly dissident to me but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing.

we bought this emer galilieo vacuum cleaner for about  more than one year ago the retractable cord broke after a short time we had to send the vacuum to nj to get it repaired by using the warranty after a month they sent it back with the same problem and the onoff button was broken as well i called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one this vacuum is very powerful however the handle hose is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use by considering its high price i guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner.

donal cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction i find his book to be biased towards the murphydolan faction poorly researched claiming that billy the kid was known as michael mccarty and his findings to be very questionable presents evidence without veryfiable sourcesafter reading this book i asked myself why did cline write this book he seems to not think to much of billy the kid so why write a book about him why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about james dolan and lg murphy.

the biggest problem with this dvd is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on jamess brake line the episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the dvd it would have taken like  more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order other than that it is a good dvd with  thomas and friends stories in which james is prominent i have a personal complaint too i purchased this in a store not online even though the box said it includes a bonus wooden train my box actually had a take along bertie in it my son didnt have a bertie so i was eager to get it but i didnt realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series my son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better.

first things first homespun is an album of demos for apple venus if you dont have that record look there first although if youre new to xtc skylarking is the usual recommendationso a collection of demos what to expect essentially its a trackbytrack match for apple venus sonically you couldnt tell its so much a set of demos except in a couple places frivolous tonight because it sounds so complete in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes even in places you wouldnt expect it like orchestral workouts river of orchids and green manis it interesting yeah extremely and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original knights in shining karma but truth to be told unless youre a diehard you probably dont need to hear the work versions of this material more casual fans definitely want to check out apple venus its a fine record.

we had two beloved cats die during my childs fifth year and i wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently this book doesnt promise eternal life or give any religious message in several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life my girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime which i found slightly surprising.
  Positive
as a public school librarian i would say that lifetimes is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child or children in dealing with the subject of death however as a person of faith i would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after deaththe text states nothing that is alive goes on living for ever this statement either reflects the authors intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death or it could be interpreted as their belief statement this is why id suggest that lifetimes be read by or shared with a caring adult who would be able to answer a childs questions based on a familys belief system.

i had expected or at least hoped for a more or less straightforward account of the mothman phenomenon of some  years ago instead this meandering book comprises hick ufo sightings that are only infrequently connected with mothman and keels trustmei knowwhatimtalkingabout theories and explanations i was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men in black behaving badly with little to recommend it and aside from providing some details on the mothman sightings theres no other recommendation the mothman prophecies is a considerable disappointment.

let me just start by saying that the  mothman prophecies is not a novel nor is it a coherent story it starts strong just enough to draw you in then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole were led to believe that mr keel is a sensiable unbiased investigator when really hes a parinoid delusional whack im only  and i dont buy a word of it see the movie instead.

although i prefer books with an actual plot i dont mind reading choppy journaltype entries if there is actually a point to all of it or if at least such entries are entertaining this books are albeit only in the beginning after a while youll begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if thats just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing stylethis book wasnt worth the timeor the title theres hardly anything about the mothman in it.

i really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art instead i found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever she repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book she reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that i stopped caring about her situation her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they dont really lead to anything of interest later on her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves the title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother aside from her death during childbirth i am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book sadly.

this has got to be one of the most depressing books i have ever read not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing which it was but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality this was the first book i attempted to read by the author since i couldnt waste my time trying to finish it i am pretty sure i wont be reading any other books by jamaica kincade.

when i first heard about this book i wonderded if it was going to be a new story or a continuation fortunately a continuationi had read reviews about the book here and after the local library did not ever have a copy in sock i bought it i read it in  days reading each night after work i can say it was a good read steady flowing action no real dull moments no unnecessary story lines etc i was not disappointed at alli gave it only  stars much for the same reason others have the ending was rushed and abrupt but never fear there is to be  more books before the real ending so we all have something to look forward tothis is only the second koontz book i have read so i was unable to distinguish where he was writing and the other author was writing more die hard koontz fans may be able to tell the differenceso overall a good smooth never dull read highly recommend it to anyone looking for a different take on the classic tale of a mad scientist.

i love these anchor hocking glasses my parents have had a set of this pattern for years when i moved into my own place in college and was tired of the free plastic cups i had i went to the store and found these glasses i have  big glasses in a blue color but im wanting matching in a smaller glass and cant seem to find the same color anyway i really like that the squares help you hold the glass easier also these glasses are very stable dont tip easily plus they are bottom heavy but not too bottom heavy that way they dont slip out of your hands as easily i have broken many other glasses cause they were too bottom heavy but i have never broken one of these.

ill make this short and to the point im quite the avid reader but usually i dont enjoy books of this nature opting for fantasy and scifi escapism instead this story is just beautifully told though the subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner i was hooked immediately i honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book and i urge you to give it a shot i know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more adventure action type books but there is no lack of excitement here.
  Negative
for oxford university press there are quite a few annoying typos i can see how the new forsyte by the name scames or the unlisted french word ficbe came about as a result of faulty character recognition but how soames born in  got to be thirtyeight in in  is beyond me dont they have proofreaders anymoreby all means read the bookyou may find out how a lot of later works of literature derive from itbut not in this edition.

i was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use well this is pretty convenient just swipe but it did nothing for me i wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts however my skin remained the same and while it doesnt really have a scent there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because i have quite a sensitive nose i switched to using them on my back and got the same result which was nothing so it was an expensive experiment that didnt work it may work for someone else but it did nothing for me most disappointing i have since switched to the salicylic gel peel which hurts a whole lot more but gets the job done.

i find that the moves that wally jay was at best very mediocre i am originally from hawaii and have had many judokas that can do major moves that when watching them the moves that they do is much more fluid and very continuous to see that many martial artists are screaming their credentials and rank is making me tired though i started martial arts at  years old and became a head instructor at  i have more skills that i need to perfect i just hope to see real martial artists can be recognised.
  Negative
my review centers on only one thing  the type size this edition is disappointingly and in my humble opinion unnecessarily small increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and at most increase the book length by about a hundred pages since it is currently at almost  pages i feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another  pages with no problemwhat makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldnt require a magnifying glass if it was just a little largeri really dont believe our lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read his wor.

in the forest of midworld one had better learn to hug close to ones home tree or risk being killed by innumerable plants animals insects and other beings less well categorizedyet despite a living space defined by various levels of hell below and above this planet accommodates a small group of humans who succeeded in adapting to its rigors ironically the one intolerable element is the relatively new colony set up in a clearcut space by humans with corporate minds and driven by more motives than just sheer greedalan dean foster is one of my favorite authors  though i remain envious of his imagination writing skills and the interesting life he has fashioned for himself as much as possible on this planet hes experienced much of the action he describes in his fiction.

i read this years ago when i was a preteen and it had me hooked on sfalan dean has let me down time and time again since but this book is a classicyou must read this one itll be fun and you wont be able to put it downafter finishing this one try hunting down dark star a movienovelization that is almost as good as midworld.

a few years back i was forced to read tess for my english class nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book only a few of us could ever even finish the cliff notes for it our professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into ittess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women yes even at that time this book is overrated and should not be called a classic if you really want to read good literature read dhlawrence read tolstoy read evn modern classical writers like achebe but for crying out loud do not waste your time and money on tess.

this was one of the worst books i have ever read it goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place.

hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society they are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending he had created a virtuous women in the form of tess and ends her as a criminal it is impossible for a women of tesss virtue to turn into a criminal i would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from depression.
  Negative
tess was a very boring book from an analytical point the books major theme was fate however you must be interested in the victorian era in order to enjoy the book it is the same thing with the scarlet letter to enjoy the book you must know about the time era the problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards.

i read this book soon after i had seen the ae miniseries reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialects hardy uses throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher very good book overall.
  Negative
i remember having to read this novel in high school and wanted to read it again i had forgotten most of the story and thoroughly enjoyed following tess through her trials and tribulations albeit some self imposed.
  Negative
a beautifully written dark masterpiece about an unforgetable victorian girl her father discovers he is descended from aristocracy and drinks himself into a stupor unable to fulfill his obligations tess takes his place and through a series of misfortunes is sent away to rich relatives with the hope of getting financial assistance for her family she meets a rogue at the mansion and is taken in by him in so many ways fast forward she meets another man and falls in love through their tragic love story much is discovered about the morality rules and expectations of victorian societythomas hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work and he has conceived a story which will embed themselves into the psyche as one contemplates this work again and again its a beautiful love story and so much more highly recommended.
  Very positive

in an age of communist oppression we see a side of daniel daylewis reminiscent of the lovable letch newland in the age of innocence daniel plays perfectly a doctor living in prague who cannot tolerate oppressionor resist women and both influences drive him to do the unimaginable its amazing seeing two main rivals for his affections manage not to kill each otheras they pussyfoot around the painful truth lena olin sabina is the perfect seductress in her famous bowler hatand one can easily love as well as hate her as she tries to deceive the ever wise tereza tomas wife juliette binoche thumbs up to tereza who acknowledges what tomas cannot as she forces him to face his weaknessand their love provides a measure of redemption still its tomas decision to return to prague that results in terrible consequences if not for the needless eroticism this would have been a  star movie.

kunderas novel the unbearable lightness of being is absolutely amazing and this film falls so far short of it despite my almostimmediate dislike of the film i actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing hoping that daniel daylewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from kunderas book but i was sorely disappointedbut please read kunderas novel because it is wonderful i cant help but think that kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel immortality the present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films tv programs or cartoons what is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential.
  Negative
the unbearable lightness of being is the ability to give your body without becomimg emotionally involved this is no problem for the hero of this film but it is a wrenching experience for the heroine who believes in emotional and physical fidelity to her mate and cannot change her feelings this film explores the difference between the two and the pain that one causes the other by his lightness of beingtowards the end the movie becomes a tearjerker so be ready to cry your eyes out.
  Negative
a wonderful drama of the unfolding of two lives read the book too not for the shallowminded.
  Positive
the movie was fine to watch but it was so different from the book i told my father all about the book so he decided to rent the movie from the library and watch it with me big mistake in the film the sex scenes came off as standard sex scenes in the book there is a strong focus on the involved parties thoughts and motivations void of philosophy and psychology.
  Negative
basically it goes like this eastern european intellects survive by being in constant angst and having lots of sex at the end of what seems frigging hours and hours of selfloathing when they finally find happiness they all die in a truck accident.

living in chaos is living in stability is a book involving true stories with powerful thoughts which are encouraging and uplifting this book is personal in that it is about peoples private lives and their experiences and yet it relates to everyday life because these experiences can occur to anybody whether you are at the peak of your life or beginning a new chapter in your life something drastic can happen and change your world around the stories are touching yet enlightening and they bring you inner strength to deal with the realities of lifei would strongly recommend this book to readers from all walks of life.

i agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although i am a little biased kerouac is my favorite author this book inspired me to write a poem after i finished reading it and although it may not inspire you to do anything at all it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if youre an artist i read on the road the town and the city and just before this one the subterraneans which i found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were  or  pages long  this one was much more fun to read and i could not put it down if you really like jack you should also check out james baldwin and norman mailer.
  Positive
less plot more pot than on the road where kerouacs most famous novel was all about reckless travel music girls and rebellion dharma bums is more introspective lots of meditation soul searching and existential ruminations about life truth and nature my only regret is that i didnt choose the book format as it was hard to keep up with all the philosophical ramblings while listening in the car.
  Negative
im amazed at how many people find the dharma bums worth reading its kerouac at his flattest the sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty there is virtually no action and the buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived this is definitely not a kerouac book to recommend readers would to better to pick up a copy of desolation angels or excepting the  pages of transcribed conversation in the middle visions of cody if youve already read lots of kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart pick up vincent czyzs adrift in a vanishing city  lyrical experimental hothouse writing that takes a quicktalkin drifter out of his native kansas as far afield as berlin mexico city and paris and through it all he never loses his vernacular even when waxin metaphysical you might also try sliding over to henry miller  not tropic of cancer which is his most popular but sexus which is far better written.
  Very negative
the operative word from the title is bums this is a book about them and their self indulgent self righteous idleness a work with no redeeming features.
  Negative
very disappointed the book is a great work but there are so many unreadable words in the kindle ebook edition that after a few pages of frustration you finally give up trying this product should either be taken off the availablity or corrected for errors so it becomes readable.

i pre ordered this thinking it was a great deal for  but i was so wrong not only was it just the blu ray movie but there were no extras on either the blu ray or the regular dvd they rushed this out to trick us all this is worth  not  for  i bought the extended edition blu raydvd combo edition of suckerpunch and it came with over  hours of extras wait for the better verison this movie is so incredible save your money and wait to see it with the extras trust me i returned this the day i got it and will be saving up for the deluxe edition and maybe even the box set with tons of extras.

transformers dark of the moon my granddaughter really enjoys watching this dvd she especially likes bumble bee she is fascinated by their transformation.
  Negative
when i saw a review giving this movie  out of  the rd time this respected source has ever done so i should have listened if  had plot holes  has plot chasms there is no story a few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film plot charisma fan service michael bay really needs to stop raping peoples childhoods a la south park george lucas stylego watch the  animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is the dark side of the moon and im not talking pink floyd.
  Negative
i mean this was never the greatest movie ever but i own the other two so logically i had to have this one came quickly shipped well no problemsexcept the film itselfjustbad.

this rated as one of the worst movies that i have ever see i found it to be a total waste of my time unless you are a devoted transformers fan that must see or have all things transformers stay away from this movie.

i did a search for d movies on amazon instant video and this movie came up but when i purchased it i was disapointed to see that it wasnt d i am writing this review without watching more than  minutes of the movie so its not that the movie is bad amazon needs to relabel their d movie selection.
  Negative
lots of loud noise and quick movements just the kinds of things that monkeys and idiots enjoy pleasefor the love of god do not make another sequel this movie really sucked.
  Negative
no surprises left and a highly predictable plot but great action scenes and spectacular special effects tires hard to reinvigorate the first episode but lacks the suspense and drama my  years olds got a kick out of it i got bored.
  Very negative
absolutely rubbish would not feed this film to a dog simply not good by any measure you really ought to find something else to do with your time sure wish i did.
  Negative
by most accounts the michael baydirected transformers films to date are not very good but that hasnt stopped them from making gobs and gobs of cash and this third installment dark of the moon made the most of them all this time around sam witwicky and the autobots must race to recover and protect an ancient autobot ancestor who crash landed on the moon but the decepticons interfere and things arent exactly as they seem i found dark of the moon to be an improvement over the second installment with some impressive special effects work and action sequences but the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired dont expect to find much more to the movie than ooh big robots and explosions but hey for some thats really all you need.
  Negative
the movie wouldnt play steadily i had to watch this on netflix lateran error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasnt fast enough to play the moviemy internet connection was fine i had watched movies before and after and when i checked online with amazons customer service page i more than all the minimum requirementsthis is the first time ive had problems streaming with amazon but it was awful every  the movie would stop and pop up the error message i tried restarting the app restarting my ps and no luck.
  Negative
i gave it one star because the website doesnt allow it to go any lower and for all the effort put in by the computer animation team other than that this movie should be negative  starthe plot and sequences does not make any sense what so ever to list a fe.
  Negative
i went to see this with the hope of getting revenge of the fallens bad taste out of my mouthfission mailedwhere to begin the plot while being nowhere near as immature as rotf still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense its an overlong mess with the cgi eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film its clear that bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life its not his fort and hasnt been since the rock the movie peaks with a huge final battle in chicago that is nuts but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place the d is well used in spots but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection.
  Negative
the first transformers movie will always be the best one and its just ok the movies too long jumping back and forth very poorly constructed.
  Positive
great movie but no special features on it once i opened that movie i noticed that there is a off coupon for the d version that is coming out with special features.
  Negative
the plotstoryline was not cohesive the movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life making a movie longer is not making a movie better in fact if the movie is weak making it longer just makes the point even more painfully obviousi kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the casemaybe dreamworks will just move on to another projectsave your money if you intend to buy better rent and save the rest for a better movie.
  Negative
this is an enjoyable science fiction actioner with a fairly plausible plot for this type movie it also has excellent acting both the live actors and the voice acting for the transformer robots only beef is that its language makes it inappropriate for tweens and preteens overall excellent for adults and recommended.
  Positive
a pure joy to watch with its many special effects it is a true master piece that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
  Very positive
the title of the disk pack is totally wrongit should be blue ray  dvd and digital copy available for dla gb download to get the digital copy instead of including it to me is lameyou enter a very long url then input the code and start the download managerafter it is finished you have to enter the long url again when you try to play the movie and get a error  website not foundi can get to any other web site i enter but not to the transformers site so now the digital copy will not play because the site cannot be accessedparamount should take lessons from fox on how to include the digital copy.
  Negative
so for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching this is a hollywood movie made for an audience who loves explosions cars guns sexy women and a simple story line this movie was not made to be realistic it is a sci fi movie just pop some corn watch it and enjoy way better than the notebook or any other chick flick out there.
  Positive
i was very excited to see this movie available on amazon prime but i was disappointed once i started watching i really couldnt stand sams new model girlfriend she was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily i was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the decepticons were because they seemed very similar of course i must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if i had followed more of the transformers cartoon another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building theres foreshadowing when the nasa guy announces that theyre going to be taking refuge in a glass building what could possibly go wrong.
  Negative
watched this one and the previous one several times like this movie lots and so did the kids thanks so much.
  Positive
i know a lot of movies arent going to be kid friendly that you will have to fast forward past some things but transformers that advertise a kids theme sold as toys at stores can be find in macdonald happy meals so you would think the movie be for kids but it not they focus more on sam and love gal then what the robots story forget sam the name of the movie is transformersi rate this movie starlove the cgi for the robots but you barley seen the robots the whole movies is about sam and his love interest michael bay need to hang this up and give it to a true comic fan who can direct a movie about transformerspitiful.

do not bother cena does not have the potential of the rock or even kane for that matter they are just trying to make more money off of the uneducated wrestling fan.
  Negative
i am surprised by how much i enjoyed this surprised and a little disappointed in my own taste but anywayyou know exactly what to expect from this movie explosions fightingand thats it luckily it delivers both of those in spades especially the splosions i have never seen so many things blow up every fifteen minutes john cena barely escapes some building blowing up and in slow motion of course the story is kelly carlson is kidnapped by robert patrick and john cena must rescue herrobert patrick is plain fantastic in this flick the filmmaker is smart as he gave the lions share of the line to mr patrick he plays a great sarcastic bad guy plain and simple john cena can act in the sense that arnold schwarzenegger can act mr cena lets his actions do the speaking thankfully plus hes a hottie sooverall just an easy cheesy blowemup action bmovie the extras are pretty lame though.
  Negative
might actually watch this if cena wasnt in it if his acting is any worse than his wrestling persona this will be his last movieupdatemarine ii will star ted dibease hahahahahahah lol pathetic.
  Very negative
this movie really is a complete stinkpotthe acting is horriblethe action is way too over the top and unbeleivableand the comedy is way too stupid and cheesy first off the movie gets started in a crazy action scenewar flashback no story what so ever the car chase scene is so full of it a car gets shot with a high powered rifle like  times and is still driving around even the twist at the end was completely easy to figure out please avoid this reeking exploding crock of .

ive had many problems with sony computer items before but i thought id give this one a try after being on the phone with sony who didnt even know what the emarker was for over four hours i still cant the thing to work theres some problem with the program you download from emarkercom the program has problems loading the emarker usb drive into your computer thus you cant use it at all if i were you id wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems sony told me they would pass my problem on to the research and development team who would try to get back to me as soon as they can i hope this team knows what the product isas for me i plan on returning my emarker today.
  Negative
excellent product but sony is taking down the support for the product at the end of sept so dont bother buying shame as it was really good while it lasted.
  Negative
i recently purchased the emarker by sony it shows how far technology has come it also shows how useless some of afformentioned technology can be it looks great attached to my keyring needless to say with its sleek stylish good looks it attracts lots of attention the main problem is its lack of extremely useful features i hope sony makes some revisions and releases a better more useful product like we have come to expect from them.
  Negative
i too bought into the hype that the emarker presented but after using it for a week i realized how pathetic this product is its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and nothing else you have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station it doesnt even do that how stupid does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it tsk tsk the product is also really dependent on the internet so if you dont have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker actually even if you do have a cable or dsl line its still useless.
  Negative
where is the space for a zero star just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing i should have read these reviews first all the bad you hear about this little thing is true i am not priveliged enough to live in an area sony feels compelled to offer service in so i dont even have one station to mark the site is terrible and i cant even get the program to enable itself whats the difference though cant do anything with it anyway this is typical sony my advice check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area believe me they wont tell you it will not work in your area it however is a neat idea needs lots of work.
  Very negative
emarker started to lose its appeal when i had a problem with the driver sony provided little assistance with the situation and i basically had to solve it through trial and error the website was easy to manuever through but receiving the proper listings wasnt constant i will give sony credit for coming up with the idea and respect its potential however for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain.
  Negative
use of the emarker depends on the emarker website however sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website and so emarker devices will now be useless dont buy one unless you want a museum piecefor those of us that already own an emarker sony has graciously offered to provide a cash refund for every emarker returned directly to them.
  Negative
sony has stopped supporting the emarker and is offering refunds to anyone who already has one.
  Positive
before buying this product i read all the reviews unfortunately i didnt pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesnt work i thought i could trust a company like sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error i was wrong the complementary reviews on this site just cant be real the product looks nice but works like a piece of junk.

did the national socialists require censorship here or something the new artwork isnt even scary wtf youve ruined a classic no one buy this bs.
  Negative
as a child i would stare at the gammells illustrations while rereading each story over and over the illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion the new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice i am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print dont buy this for yourself or your kid i loved these books so much when i was a kid that i am actually going to write a letter on paper with a stamp to harper collins telling them about the role that crazy art had on my imagination and development as a creative person jeez absolutely terrible the new illustrator must have no dignity to ruin this.
  Negative
while the stories in the scary stories to tell in the dark book remain the same the stephen gammell illustrations that haunted my imagination have been scrapped for more candycoated pictureshow candycoated upon searching for the other tales of horror by alvin schwartz in a dark dark room which was written for level  of the i can read childrens collection i found those watercolored images to be scarier than the cartoonish images in the rerelease of scary stories to tell in the dark.
  Neutral
i was very disappointed to discover that the copies i ordered the scary trilogywhile described as being illustrated by stephen gammell were actually the updated versions with watereddown artwork by another artist i am not keeping this books as they are worthless to me without the better artwork this is the first time ive been disappointed with an order from amazon but its a big one you need to change your description to include the correct illustrator.

this video was let down the historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster and a pain to fast forward thru every time i want to practice dancing i agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to freestyle and improvisation i am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly and without any commentary i find myself struggling during this part or worse  just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated on the positive side the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful especially the belly roll and undulations i was really struggling with those and im now confidently on my way i wish they had covered more moves in that manner bottom line its been a week and im already seeking out another video to buy.

all of paxton quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes men are usually stronger  larger than most women so a well trained female in the use of a firearm and the knowledge of when to use it in todays society is almost a necessity i purchased these books as gifts for the women i care about as a guide which points them in the correct direction.
  Negative
while there is some very good information in the book i ask you to consider the source ms quigley has testified on behalf of a woman shooting a gun down a hillside toward a strip mall at some dogs that were barking but not approaching her that she was acting reasonably the jury disagreed and convicted the defendant she was testifying for of grossly negligent discharge of a firearm her approach is a bit aggressive.

we visited the dingle peninsula of ireland this fall and had to see this movie that was filmed there turns out that in addition to having great scenes of the dingle countryside it also has a very good story line and terrific acting and some irish history thrown in for good measure.
  Positive
this movie would make a great opera adaptation dare i say sara miles carries the movie more than the david lean imprint and the obnoxiously heavyhanded score.
  Negative
a surprisingly bad film painfully slow paced and convoluted it really is one hell of a mess the exploitation of a pitiful malformed character played by john mills is so over the top insensitive and with a tasteless comic bent and so frequently employed that it demands mention the story feels minor to begin with but is so disjointed and inane that it is best described as no story at all the music is hard to describe ill be kind its not helpful the only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous almost hypnotic cinematography that and perhaps a young and radiant sarah miles that should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing and just a little devotion to good taste but instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director david lean.
  Very negative
i saw this movie when it first came out it was hauntingly beautiful i am so happy to get it on dvd some may find it a little slow in areas but i loved it if you appreciate the work of david lean and the acting of sarah miles and robert mitchum then you will love this it ranks right up there for me with dr zhivago which i also had the pleasure of seeing when it first came out on the big screen a wonderful epic movie the seller was extremely prompt and made the purchase feel as though i was buying from a friend way to do business.

it sounds great im just wondering y it did not already have  stars di u think it would be great  my  year old.

sorry about the star rating  it is not for the books content i cant read it but for the horrible way it displays on my ipadthe cover page is nice and big fills the screen and looks great ever subsequent page however is about half size meaning that two pages fit across the ipad screen and the font is too small to be readablefurthermore the ipad version only allows landscape viewing and the stupid kindle app remains in this orientation after returning to my books list and moving on to another bookam i missing something here.

puss in boots is a wonderful story this book is so beautiful that is like a precious work of art a great read aloud with exceptional illustrations children and adults adore it presenting this tale to children takes great thought though try to avoid the dishonesty terrorism and thievery and focus on resourcefulness first impressions and survival fred marcellino is one of the top illustrators of our time wish he had a website.

the first  songs are incredible and the rest are ok i live in france and chumbawamba never got really big there so i havent heard tubthumping a zillion times which makes it still interesting to listen to.

i got this cd about a year and a half ago and i still listen to it it is a very good cd with about  good dance tracks plus the trumpet playing is great i also liked on how smoothly the music and the vocals came together this is truly a masterpiece.
  Very positive
besides the much maligned megahit tubthumping which i didnt like when it was first released but like now this is a solid cd with great arrangements lyrics and performances its not perfect but how many cds are perfect these days i have recently discovered ready mades and then some  clearly a star effort and a symposium on how to arrange a song masterfully done i wont write a songbysong critique here because several other reviewers have done a more than adequate job of that however i do put forward a challenge to rtbarry in az to move beyond his very own drivel masquerading as a review if he is capable to explain in detail what in his opinion is lacking in this cd that rates it only one star or does he believe we are supposed to obey his fiat review as if he were kim jongil of north korea otherwise rtbarry dont waste our time with drivel.
  Negative
this is really a great cd chumbawamba has many political and social thoughts you just have to understand them.
  Positive
the one star is for the only one good song on this cd tubthumpingactually this song blows after you hear it more than  times this cd has only been in my cd player oncethat is the day i bought it if you like wasting money buy this cd.

i was so disappointed in the first book foundation i gave it two stars ive been wanting to read the trilogy for years and i couldnt believe that that mediocre pulp was it but foundation and empire is the saving grace i look forward to the next book.
  Positive
i liked this book i dont really have anything profound to say im only writing a review because for some reason amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a reviewasimov seems to have an interesting twist on european history in this book as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the roman empire the successor germanic kingdoms and the rise of the merchant class in the renaissance understanding the history of western civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to asimovs fictional galactic history.
  Neutral
the foundation novels are superb i went on to read the entire original trilogy the first foundation book being my favorite the story jumps ahead by leaps and bounds between sections which can be confusing at first but ends up making for a fantastic treat cant recommend this series highly enough for any scifi fan.
  Negative
i cannot recommend foundation and its entire series highly enough when it comes to worldbuilding and examining the possibilities of earths future asimov does it best his entire basis is that intelligence learning and confrontation of the unknown will be our salvation instead of ignorance or seeing who carries the biggest gun a welcome change.
  Positive
the book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea but then it dives deep into politics it is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the foundation specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way outthe problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the xvii century with its priests kings viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods the gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well for a far future based science fiction.
  Negative
foundation and all the other books that complete the extense colection are wonderful i remember when i read this book  years ago and as you see i still love it if you dont want to read all the books of the series you dont have to do it the saga of foundation its only three books foundation foundation and empire and second foundation but if you want to read a good good goodgooooooooood series of books read them all you wont regret it i really loved all this books.
  Positive
isaac asimov is an exception author in any genre he just happens to write in science fiction his foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction if you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose the universe he creates is so vivid that the book is difficult to put down in case you couldnt telli am a fan.
  Negative
prelude to foundation is excellent however you should stop there foundation is bad this book is totally predictable read dune if you want something intelligent and entertaining read foundation if you want something that you probably wont even finish.

i got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods not a good book to pick up occasionally takes a focussed reading and thats just one of the series.

i was dissatisfied with this novel being an avid fan of asimov and the foundation seriesthe younger version of the mathimatical genius did not match with older one who changed the history of his race for the bette.

i think the above review needs a corrective tynan was the sharpest funniest and bestinformed theatre critic of his generation he was also a wonderful stylist and a precocious one many writers never write as well as tynan did while still in his teens these letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language but theres more to them than that tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider as someone pushing the envelop.

mykel board  punk rocker new yorker gonzo provocateur  fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to mongolia for one year to teach englishand im so glad he did his easytoread writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny from his problems overcoming constipation because metamucil is not sold in outer mongolia board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea to his visits to mongolian dance clubs to the confusing hurdles presented in this postsoviet limbo land welcome to mongolia is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention unlike most travel memoirs there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture  even though there were times that i a fellow traveler longed for mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country  making this book a fun unrestrained ride through a remote kafkaesque kingdom buy this book.

no im not making this up somebody actually produced this recording actually two people produced it nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it i say nearly because most of the tracks were played by a trio who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet im not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining these folks certainly were not up to the task the end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties unbelievable.

wow words can barely express the awesomeness of this piece first i will start with the movie brilliant that is all there is to be said about the film now the ost beautiful work a very dark and somber piece very moody and atmospheric its not something you just listen to for fun at least for me its more of a background music while doing your business its just brilliant every track in amazing from beginning to end i was unfamiliar with johnny klimek and reinhold heilds work this cd however makes me want to definatly look into it it is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film some tracks are very tranquil and moody while others pound out beats and are very fast paced all in all a  for the cd a definate must have for any collection highly recommneded.

its a very nice camera dont get me wrong however due to its compact design the speaker is too close to the tape motor during quiet and not so quiet areas you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record canon confirmed this as a design flaw the zr  and  all do this i was really disappointed i returned mine i wish there was a way to fix it.

couldnt agree more w prendergasts review concerning the laughable typos i thought the proof reader or editor of the version i had must be abusing drugs themselves how distracting to read a so called classic and find it reading like a hs sophomore paper  and a drunk sophomore at that i somehow managed to finish the book but came on amazon immediately following it to see if others read the same erroneous version weird typos poor punctuation etc ruined it for me.

this is probably mel gibsons first film a film hes done while he was in his s there is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native australia but this film launched him as an international movie star especially since they released mad max  which was universally released as the road warrior and the road warrior is one of my top ten favorite films of the ssure mad max has some of that cheesy seventies style but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made todaymad max is that one film being over  years old that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than  years old today this film is a classic in the action hero dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre.
  Positive
ive seen mad max dozens of times but after watching the new se dvd it was like watching it again for the very first time that is not an exaggeration the new dvd offers the choice of the poorly dubbed us soundtrack or the original australian soundtrack watch the original track the pacing of the film changes entirely as do the characters the original soundtrack breathes new life into this filmthe features are great theres a trivia track that pops up info about the production cars and aussie slang terms used as you watch it  documentaries tv spots theater trailer and morethe print is fabulous and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen having seen it both ways now i can tell you that the pan  scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action if youve seen this movie in the past and thought it was ok this new dvd will have you saying it was great.

the performances seem fine the recording is a mess the woodwinds are lost in the intro to festive overture because there is too much reverberation the mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall more like a cavern this is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding this is a one listen cd then file it away forever.

this is yet another lush shimmering pscyoerotic opera by franz schreker wonderfully performed by the forces involved  i suggest you just read the review of  to get a good summary of the surreal plot at least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composers masterpiece die gezeichneten and while i wouldnt disagree with that judgement this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling particularly in the second half other than mozart bizets carmen and a small handful of others im not a great opera fan but schrekers output in this genre to be absolutely stunning highly recommended.

madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical she is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of lament it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality while in the song beuonos aires she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention she is a great actor if i could change one thing it would be to switch jimmy nail and jonathin pryce because nail should sing more songs and price should sing less.

i had to try sleeping on it the first night  in a couple of hours it was less firm which made it difficult to roll around on it didnt take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistakereturning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough prospective buyers should be mindful of this.

we bought these beds in september for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit they are  and  and weigh under  pounds these beds can not make it through one single night inflated we either have to get up during the night and reinflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortableweve had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselvesim very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since its clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years agomy opinion is save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on thats what were doing now.

i saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase we ordered two twins for our camp mine started leaking immediately my husbands seemed to be good from spring to nearly winter when his too began to leak so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat that was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge my father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again our camp closes down during winter so spring will be the big test i suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe theres hope.

  Positive
took it to france and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew bought a hand pump to pump it up it was a painful job after it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box.

i bought this for my off campus residence and the two months it worked fineand then the problems began first two the curves on the top not sure what exactly they are called merged into one so i had to sleep on one half of the bed recently i noticed it was starting to sink and reinflated it shortly afterward i heard some air and found where it was leaking and didnt think too much off it then in the middle of sleeping i woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up then i found out that the main support line is for their pools i would recommend a different brand like coleman or getting something from cabelas.

i bought this to replace my queen size intex bed that exploded inside only lasted months i like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size i think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside the twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger if youre looking for a bed for just yourself this should be perfect.

for those wondering like myself this does come in a discrete package now as for the actual product omg ive never felt something like this before this is my first official toy and i am sooooo pleased its a little large and kinda hard but thats okay works wonderfully i would definitely recommend especially for the price.

this was much bigger then i had anticipated that being my own fault but the reason i gave it only  star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt the bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable so my man suggested i turn it around and then my taint became irritated not one bit pleased with this product.
  Negative
while i love the jack rabbit feature the vibrator is overall too big for me to use i can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable maybe because its too big i cannot feel the beads at all i dont think they have any room to move the vibrator is also quite heavy it would be perfect if it were more slender so girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product.

i was misguided by the review ratings in all honesty this product is awful it has a toxic smell to it and the bunny ears cause more pain than pleasure i dont recommend this product.

i am very hard to please because i like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration this item does not work for what i intended it for i tried it twice and hated it both times i was so worked up from trying to make it work that i had to switch back to my bullet i gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol she loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me.

this is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality  i got the clear one cause like other reviews say your eye really doesnt jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubblegum my first vibrator hahahaits really quiet for something that movesdoes so much and it is more powerful than i expected i had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration  but even that got the job down in  seconds yeah i timed it this might take some getting used to for some but i absolutely love itthe only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more lifted off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one people have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have a smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale  and it went away after  or  washesi highly recommend buying this.

this album contains danceable techno and mellow techno tranceyambient unlike most albums all of the songs on this album are great youll definitely get your moneys worth from this album and even though its over  years old the music still sounds brilliant like michael stipe of rem said this album was several years ahead of its time.
  Positive
i received this as a christmas gift from a friend who knows i like hot tea all of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea i avoid drinking caffein which green tea contains so i gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections the chest is kind of cheap paper glued over something as described by another reviewer its pretty but i dont expect it to hold up.

this is a good double cd packed with alot of favorites i liked slot of her dialouges between songs her words  messages are invaluble  timeless il divo accompanies her on several songs like evergreen i would have preferred her to sing that one alone the music of the night   somewhere not favorable with il divo.

ok first of all i was looking for lighthouse the classic poprock group there was nothing to tell me that this album was a gospel cdok i can live with thatso i listen to my new lighthouse gospel cd let me tell you i was not impressed the engineering sucked the music was mmmmmmm ok i guess and the singing really had no feeling or substance behind itso if you are into gospel steer clean and if you are looking for lighthouse the classic poprock group this is not itlatter.

there was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the watchtower toys with  action figures we thought that the  action figures were included  they were not also do not be fooled by the too good to be true price they charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a storeotherwise the package arrived in a timely manner was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier.

if you get to this review please please do not spend your hard earned money on this toy even at half price it is not worth it i faced the same problems as everyone else im forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box a watse of money nuff said.

after an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up the legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open this was a major disapointment we returned it the next day in pieces.

picked one of these up the other day mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller but thats all it has is looksafter using the keyboard it quickly became tedious to use since not only are the keys hard to push down they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places and the wireless is hit and miss possibly because it runs at only mhz frequency it will miss keys here and there so you have to type very slooow and check your work very often and with passwords where you cant see what you are typing good luck it quickly becomes a tire there is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll featurethe processor is  generations older than the current dual core intel processors and the ram is standard ddr instead of ddrunless hp updates the components and the keyboard this is a terrible value and a pos.

romeo and juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love although their parents were terrible enemies because of this their lives ended with their tragic deaths making their families agree in what for years they were fighting fori like this story because it shows the bravery young people have without caring what adults say they should have thought this better so their wouldnt have ended in the tragic way they did both of them committing a tragic suicide this tragic also affected other lives such as their parents which suffered a lot for them.
  Positive
stupid teenagers a boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in and poor communication shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.
  Very negative
romeo and juliet is a beautiful story and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of shakespeare who doesnt like to read or hear about starcrossed lovers who hasnt already heard the legend the play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly and its beautifully written romeo and juliet are so tragic in their love and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless read it for the story but enjoy it for the beautiful prose.
  Positive
we think that the book was a great influence to our english because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things to look up words in the dictionary and new wordswe liked the end when all the main characters died it left me a great message if it wasnt for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadnt understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because leonardo di caprio acted as romeo in the video.
  Negative
this is an excellent book but this edition is extremely poorly produced there are far too many typos and little information about the original publication of the book for example the layout is ugly its great the book is cheap but i wish i had paid a little more for a nicer version.
  Negative
if this isnt the worst movie ive ever seen it certainly is in the running i would point out all the absurdities in the film but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives so here goes kevin sorbo while delivering a truly pathetic performance  i swear he must have been drinking while filming this  looked to be in fairly good shape thats it.

not everyone can like every album but for me one second is my alltime favorite i have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers one second is different from yellos other albums and in my opinion doesnt hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno while the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there and brilliantly done the sound is less annalog and has more feel it is not background music but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed the latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for shirley basseys style and voice in my mind this album creates its own genre of music which i have yet to find elsewhere it is different but it is very very good.
  Negative
thrilled at my daughters pregnancy i purchased this book for her because i could remember how much i admired it  years ago when i read it her feedback mom  its really good until it gets to homosexuality it fails miserably therei just reread the passage on page  of the library edition and now i want to throw it out of the public librarys collection i wontill keep it for the good parts and try to forgive briggs outdated and misinformed attitude but i wont give it  stars any more.

this book is unlike most of the books written on the topic while nuel emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball to release new information on manson and the case against him he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which werent really manson in his own words but were nothing more than fabrication.

watch charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him sayemmons took his life and put that in my bookthen he took my life and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his lifeso hes milked you for two books hes a good crookthe way charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than  percent is factual.
  Negative
for all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in charlies own words youre mistaken at the time of the so called interviews the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils tape recorders etc the words you see are those of the authors same old media hype to make a buck the author betrayed charlie by pretending to be his friend this is why charlie declines so many interviews everybody distorts everything he has ever said so my advice is if you want to read the authors take on charlie buy it if you want the truth dont buy it.

do you really think that this stuff is going to work especially the trapping so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt workthe lin lop sauthe bong lop sauthe same hand tan to lop saucmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be itbut like bruce said man or for that matter any person man or woman is more important than any art or system even applies to jkd and wing chunnot the other way around.

nappily ever after was a true page turner i couldnt put it down venus was a down to earth character that i could relate too you wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter i was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first i look forward to more books by trisha r thomas i wish it could have went the other way but the author made it very believable.
  Negative
if you dont like to be surprised in the least bit this novel is for you if you dont mind the writers technique or dont see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book i on the other did not the plot was predictablethe characters were onedimensional and the language reminded me some what of mcmillan  an unpolished mcmillan of course the best part of this book was the cover and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied.

i really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times there are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing aside from these short comings however the science  plot work well together the characters are reasonably complex  the universe captivating.
  Positive
this story is gripping in part because the  female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew they are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally the act of the captain to pursue the fleeing object and thus stranding here crew forever inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny that this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew there is a span of billions of years this book is about responsibility and living up to it including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake great read.

if id only read the reviews before purchasing this for my  year old i would never have bought it it is very flimsy and top heavy the elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together as i was driving all over town looking for the best price i wondered why no store had the batcave out on display once we got it together i realized why we ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over we have lots of batman toys and other mattel products this is by far the biggest disappointment in  years of toy buying if it wasnt from santa it would be going back without a doubt buy anything else.
  Negative
our almost  year old couldnt wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection it looks great on the box however this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost  years it is so flimsy and cheaply built pieces fall off and it tips a lot hopefully it will be redesigned with sturdier materials if you are considering purchasing itdontyoull save your self some money and frustration.

i was looking forward to a new scanner after my hp died after just a year i purchased this one based on the several good reviews on amazon and other sitesnow that i have the scanner i am sorely disappointed the picture quality is horrible no matter the tweaking i do in the scanner dialog the picture is faded and grainythe software itself is the least useful interface ive ever worked with the auto buttons makes the image worse the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to paperport something i never want to do.

for those of you who might think that a clavell novel might be a little too long for you this book is great and the shortest of the six books in the asian saga plus it stands out in its own right as a book that will leave an impression on you emotionally and as a result of reading a good book.
  Positive
this is an excellent book and of the clavell books i have read all except gaijin this has the most interesting if not the best ending it seemed to me that clavell got slightly redundant with the natural disaster ending but he managed to avoid it in this book i found that the way the story and the characters individual stories were resolved or rather unresolved fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a wwii prison camp oh yeah the rest of the book is pretty cool too.

after a little over a year my zen xtra has stopped playing sound everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on creatives players on a dinky  portable i wouldnt expect much but on a  device this is just unacceptabletheir warranty period and customer service is a joke go have a look at their forums stay away from creative products there are other alternatives out there.

simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod even better ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap.

after roughly a year of fairly reliable use ive also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack now im wondering what to do with an item that i paid nearly  because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago limited being somewhat of an understatement no one should ever have to consider fixing and possibly further marring something they paid that much money fora month ago i wouldve given this item four stars after coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that creative continues to neglect im outright angry that im not alone.

another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for i was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued is this true or is this a classic baitandswitch technique their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price when you get to the store they dont have it but when they look it up in their computer it shows up as discontinued it is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be aboutadifferent models from the one you actually buy online or instore the creative labs own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion.

i actually give this zero stars but had to give it a star due to amazons rulesthe title is slightly misleading as it is not all about wilsons involvment with manson thats just a part of it and warning that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know i know brian wilson is the brains behind the beach boys but this documentary was predominantly about brian this should have been titled brian wilson and the satan featuring the rest of themive seen other beach boys documentaries even made for tv movies that were better than this jumpy compilation i felt like i was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had add.

unfortunatelly the dvd is dissapointing for tinas fans the show is fantastic but both dolby digital and dts version of this dvd have one of the worst sounds i ever heard my subwoofer didnt move once while the tweeters of the front speakers nearly went on flames more the soundtrack was reedited with sound taken from other concerts thats incredible  at one moment i swear that i heard the word munchen despite the fact that the concert is in amsterdam and oh yes the dvd is overpriced forget amsterdam and dont miss one last time in concert as it has verry good sound quality and image not speaking abut the phantastic show.

i play canasta and frequently wind up with gobs of cards which since i have small hands and am also a klutz i drop a lot and mix up the card holders are on the large size so they hold a lot of cards and have little props so they can stand alone they are also slightly curved to prevent other players from accidentally seeing your cards a very good deal for klutzes everywhere.
  Negative
if you cant hold the cards this will work but i believe they lost sight of their purpose and are trying to address a problem from outside the box the idea is to make it easier for the individual it can be difficult to get the cards in place and then change their positions defeating the fundamental purpose a block of wood will do better the card holder shouldnt be a game within a game.

eric flint has become an established sf author however he has more than one style of writing this book is in an experimental style more related to rabelais cervantes voltaire swift and sterne this book set in joes world is the second book in this series although not main stream in any way it is an enjoyable book and well worth reading once read i was hooked into asking where is the rest of this story this is quite normal for this style of writing and i await eagerly the next volume.

related to the philosophical strangler stories overlap but this book focuses on gwendolyn benvenutti  the sorcerer story of events in these characters lives before during and after phil strangler found the language a bit much to wade through a second time and not as funny if you loved philosophical strangler youll probably love this one but if you were growing weary by the end of the strangler you should probably pass this one up.

this book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirtysix warships ranging from a roman galley to a nimitzclass aircraft carrier naval buffs will find this a useful book with numbered guides accompanying the cutaway color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships yet the selection of what constitutes a great warship is rather idiosyncratic the selection is exclusively western in its orientation as chinese junks ottoman galleys or imperial japanese navy vessels completely absent moreover the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both leaving out others more deserving in the process as a result while an interesting resource it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book.

the service was good but the product didnt have enough info for me to make a wise decision at the end i couldnt use the product on my jabra ear piece the item description should have information on compatible ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice.

these are not the same that come on the earbud and are not easy to use or to hear from i sent mine back.

super fast delivery the last ear loop on my jawbone had worn out the large ear gel fit over the jawbone earbud and with a little superglue stays there it fits in my ear without using any loops after a full day the ear is a little tender but it is getting better the more i use it i would highly recommend the ear gels for anyone with a jawbone improves sound and the fit of the sensor with the jaw.
  Negative
save youself some money the jabra ear gels are an absolute waste they actually fit worse than the stock ear buds from jawbonei was even more disappointed that i paid  shipping on a worthless  product its not even worth returning lesson learned hopefully you will also.
  Negative
these really do make wearing a jawbone a lot better for me the only problem i found with them is that you have to buy so many just to get the one that fits right.
  Negative
they look cheep and feel cheep and well they are cheep but they dont work which is the bottom line fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a bucks for falls out of your ear its not worth it since jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the jawbone which fit your snugly in your ear they also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you so this product fails and had id seen them in person i wouldnt have spent my money on them.
  Negative
when i first installed one of these on my new jawbone ii they were fantastic they fit my ear canal perfectly negating the need for the ear loop that came with it unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset the ear pieces would not stay on the jawbone and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear i tried washing and drying them thoroughly but that only helped for an hour or so i am not sure what the fit problem is but they turned out to not work for my jawbone ii and me at all.
  Negative
they feel better than the jawbone junk but there is no perfect fit even though they give you several different sizes then the jawbone bluetooth falls out of most of thembasically a waste of money unless you are one of the lucky ones that all fits as you had hoped.

the product arrived as expected the ear gels fit the jawbone well and were perfect for ill perfect ears.
  Neutral
i bought this to see if using the gels would help keep my jawbone in place none of the gels fit in my ear.

originally i would give this horrible dipiction of the odyssey  star but because of one of the last scenes where ugly ttelemachus threw two spears at once i give it two stars everything was horrible to my opinion the accents kept changing everything if you read the book before you watched the movie you would thinkt hat this was all a joke so if anything just read the book by itself so two stars for two stars thrown by ugly t.
ive seen better movies on the all news channel odysseus was played very well but his part was boring as well as the rest of the movie scylla looks like s cartoonsi drew better stuff in st gradeevery single scene looks so fake it isnt even funny i can probably get more entertainment watching an earthworm i would not recommend this to anyone young or old this movie isnt worth a penny in my book.

this movie was very boaring i really didnt enjoy it at all it was to gory i just dont enjoy when people kill i also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age and dont enjoy the anceint times they were rough and crewl times the movie the odyssey took place in greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures i really dont enjoy things like that others might although  there is a part i did like i enjoyed the part of the movie when calypsovenessa williams kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for  years i thought that was very interesting the other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as penelopegreta scacchi atheneisabella rossellini cyclopesreid asato and eurybatesron cook those were just a few so all in all i would give this movie one star i f you like movies like this then its great and go watch it but if you dont its not a movie for you as you can see.

as always gerard durrells works make me want to hop on a flight to greece right now his imagery of the lush flora and fauna there make it seem irresistible to anyone especially small boys though it was an enjoyable read it seemed a bit too similar to my family and other animals as though this sequel was everything he had forgotten to put into the first one which is exactly what the author states in the introduction this book seemed to focus a bit more on the animals less on the comical family and though sea life is fascination crustaceans do get a bit old this book is very relaxing to read and almost makes you feel like you are a little boy again slow paced and funny this enjoyable book put corfu at the top of my list of places to go.

quite often bringing a classic story like moby dick to the screen is a thankless task but at least john hustons  version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances even moby dick looked a lot more realistic in  this version just doesnt make it  skip it and buy a copy of gregory pecks rendition instead youll be glad you did.

i picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it i rated this book  stars because even though i found it to be very enjoyable i seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading nevertheless i was still surprised by the ending i found the tension between hester and monk to be both intriguing and frustrating especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book needless to say i was delighted to discover that there are  soon to be  more books in the series i plan to read them all.
  Negative
since i started somewhere in the middle of the series this book was the explanation of who monk was and about his accident in which he lost his memory this is a wonderful series and i would recommend it to anyone and suggest beginning with this book the face of a stranger which is the first in the series for a more complete appreciation of each following book.

when i read a mercedes lackey book i expect to care about what happens to someone in the book there was no one here who was real enough to care about the people all felt like shadows without true substance or reasons to their actions i couldnt find reasons to cheer for anyone one problem is there were too many people to follow easily since there were so many none of them were drawn richly enough to draw me into their world.

i love her books so much this movie is an absolute insult the original story was so wonderful i cant understand why the film makers thought they were making something better and ed what about ed geez i could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms foolishly thinking that the movie would get better and after that i was done another good thing about dvds is that you dont have to be kind and rewind it would have be a waste of electricity and my vcr this movie is right up there with ishtar except worse.

i rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things i had heard talked about it like that it was funny and romantic and had wonderful scenery what a disappointing storythe story had no sense of direction it seemed badly glued together as if the scriptwriters were saying well make her a divorced womanand then well make her go on a gay tourand oh wait lets make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasnt known for even one dayand lets make her flirt with the real estate man all in all the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character.

what a waste of two hours as a romantic comedy it falls short on both romance and comdey as a movie trying to give over a lesson it is trite overdone and poorly performed the writing is unimpressive the story is dull and far fetched and many details either make no sense or detract from the overall plot what was the point they seemed to have forgotten to find one.

the john houseman character from the excellent james caan original version jumped into a time machine with the intent of destroying the social commentary critical to multinational monopolies from the first film and spreading cultural plastics so prevalent in his future history the result is dumbed down junk where you must give up the idea of wondering how movie executives decisions are made i think he did a good job.

i should say worse than battlefield earth proportions this whole movie makes you just sit there at the end and go why everything about this convoluted sarcastic beefed up badly edited tripe is confusing to watch poorly executed and loses you  minutes into the film you are introduced to boring characters cliched camera angles and material we all know john mcteirnan is far more capable of i was thankful i got to rent this instead of buying it because quite frankly this movie just plain stinks if you really want to see the real rollerball rent dont buy the original the original has a much stronger story and for cryin out loudjames caan hes a legend man i dont know what kind of future chris klein has in movies but as far as action movies go lets just put it this way we already have keanu reeves and quite bluntly hes a much better actor steer clear and save your money.

although these sheets are pretty and warm their size and fit are horrible the fitted bottom sheet is far too long plus the elastic around the corners is not tight enough to keep the sheet on the mattress which tends to come off through the night and the flat sheet is barely wide enough i would not buy these again.

these run very large and do not fit correctly because of this however for the price i still think they are a great bargain they are very heavy duty and will probably last many years they are also very warm almost too warm here in southen california those people in cold climates would love them anyhow i would be giving five stars except for the mismatched fit but i just tucked it in really good and they stay on the bed just fine.

the many ideas given eat the inside of sandwiches eat the top off of canapes avoid the crust can give a true celiac serious consequences sometimes a person can eat gluten with no obvious side effects but do great silent damage to ones intestines there are complications to celiac disease such as refractory sprue and collagenous sprue i have these complications due to not being strict enough when following the gluten free diet.

i have read the other reviews of this book and while i appreciate everyones opinions i must say that this book helped me immensely i am new to the gluten free life i have been ill for two years and am just finding out that gluten is one of my issues i had no prior knowledge and this book did a lot to allay my fears i havent read against the grain so i cannot compare the two jax made me laugh often even through my tears i recommend it for those just starting out.

most of the people who gave shining sparkly reviews of this book focus on how it made them feel it is not boring jax is a talented writer ill give her that but when i read on page  that the perscription drugs i was on and had been on for  years both pfizer drugs were not gf i was seriously troubledmany followups with both pfizer and online support groups have indicated just how full of erroneous information this book isi went off my meds immediately thinking i was injesting gluten i suffered the undue consequences of going off cold turkey when i needed to taper off in actuality those meds are gf and always wereif you want the facts as boring as they are  dont rely on this book if you want some comfort and laughs then give it a read but be sure to take any factual information with a grain of salt as they sayjax was indeed very lax when writing this book.

the only type of person to whom i could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a forest level view of them from one source there is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability the series from the gesell institute your one year old your two year old etc etc provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages raising your spirited child is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child i am saddened and more than a bit annoyed i purchased the book on the basis of the organizations recommendation that the american academy of child  adolescent psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight.

a rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period houses argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument an argument which goes something like this many impressionist works and also those by manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and techniquethey are thus subversivedisruptive and oppositional and as a result political i had expected the book to address in a more explicit detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics however many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter  the viewer of modern life is well worth a read.

ive studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of freuds work in philosophy of psychology while making some entertaining remarks freud has now long been discounted as anything valid and understandably so.
  Positive
this book is a watershed in human intellectual history in it freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes our inner unconscious lives dreams are not nothing and they are not in freuds eyes rare religious gifts but rather to the key to our own mental life freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations i am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing i do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretationsunderstanding human intellectual history is now impossible without knowing this work.
  Negative
freuds the interpretation of dreams is a unique book his treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind but neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book the great achievement of freuds theory is its immunity to criticism in other words it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book his main tenet  a dream is a fulfillment of a desire  cannot be attacked in any intelligible way if one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment or if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished viz the desire to destroy freuds dream theory.

this tape is simply fun and informative i am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but i had to watch this im a woman why not the lady is so corky and yet serious enough to have you practically writing notes like your in a college i would recommend this video to anyone interested in really learning about childbirth she explains everything how your body should be functioning what is stretching what liquids to look for as signs of this and that charts of how the baby is actually sitting and how exactly its growing and she even quizzes the husbands there is so much to learn open a bag of kettle corn and grab a pillow though its like four or five hours long phew but it probably wouldnt be best to watch it all in one sitting anyway it is a lot of information to grasp enjoy.

i read this book  years ago its still makes me highly agitated every time i think about it you just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end it has the worst ending ever it still pisses me off that i spent the time reading it there isnt really much of a story just a lot of details and weird issues there are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with any sort of common sense aside do not read if you are sensitive to rape that should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere not recommended.

when i first picked up this book some  years ago i was initially put off by the thickness of it but once i started reading i was totally hookedthe strong selfassured and intellegent female character was truely refreshing i have given this book to my sisters and to several friends and whenever i get into a discussion about good books this is one of the books i bring up and strongly encourage every i know to readtoday i have come to shop for this book so that i might send it to a penpal in west africa he wants me to send him books that will assist him in speaking better english and this was the first book i thouht to send him well that and a dictionarythanks to jean auel for writing such a great novel.

when my dad first gave me this book to read it had the orignal cover and was sort of deteriorating and i had a feeling that i woudlnt really like it that was definitely not what happened ayla is a very inspirational character and its hard to put the book down once you start it unfortunetaly i was on vacation when i started it so i had to stop reading but i would have read it in a day i quickly bought the other books in the series and read each one better than the next although the clan of the cave bear was ultimatly the best one id recommend the series to someone over the age of  it would be hard to follow if you were younger and some parts are inappropriate especially in the following books this was one of my favorite books and be warned once you start its so hard to stop.

i own this album in the original vinyl and a earlier cd release i am always a sucker for a remaster so decided what the heck i chose poorly  the remixes just dont sound right for all i know this  version was the original intent i hope not.
  Negative
if a music company wants to remix an old album they should put it on a second disc like pearl jam did with their recent rerelease of  not replace the original album mix like mushroom is doing here this new remix is not as good as the original versions of these songs wish they would remaster the original mix and issue it.

the kindle version has no illustrations and the formatting makes it hard to read and enjoy the verses the limericks appear without logical line shifts and where the illustration is supposed to be it just says illustration which is a lot more annoying than not having anything there at allits free but its hard to read and that kind of takes the fun out of it at least for me.

this was their first true recording project although it was thier second full album i give this album four stars because though i love this album and this band five stars would mean its an album that stands next to physical graffitti the white album and a select few other records this album is a must own for fans who enjoy any of the splinter disciplines of what sabbath hendrix and zeppelin started an album worth the money with many great songs and performances if there are any criticisms one would be the production it leaves some room for improvement beyond that i hope this band can continue to build upon this awesome release for years to come purchas and enjoy.

a jesse stuart harvest is a collection of stories by jesse stuart all the stories bring out his personality and the talking of the old west this book also has an introduction that narrates the life of the author jesse stuarti think this book is really good because it takes you on a trip through time and into a world of adventure my favorite story was snake teeth because it has a lot of cliffhangers and adventure i would recommend this book for  yrsadults because normally after  years of age you will understand the dialect in this book.

here is another example of hollywood going wrong the history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right nevertheless the film makers got a few details correct but then added improbable special effects far too many triplanes annoying social lesson stereotypes and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage conceptually the movie should have been a winner in execution it is a disappointment they ruined a potentially good story instead of buying this movie i would suggest the blue max as the aerial scenes are far better or just propose that the wouldbe viewer read a history bookas a parting comment however i always have liked jean reno he is the good part of this film.
  Negative
i have enjoyed watching flyboys several times the special effects are outstanding and very lifelike one of the features that i really enjoyed was watching the bonus features at the end i noticed that one of the people interviewed was from colorado and as a result i went to his museum and checked out versions of some of the planes represented in the moviei find the investment in time and money for this feature was well worth it.

i thank god for the writer of this book this book explains new insight on jesus parables taking in consideration of the lords geographical location and cultureit took me a while to read this book why because this is the type of book that you may want to meditate after reading it its not something that you read and let bygones be bygonsthis book particularly focuses on what our actions should be as jesus followers it addresses issues like greed or mesociety that we often ignore id like to stress out that jesus pointed everything plainly for us this book only reminds us to go back and look deeper within ourselves and question if god is really what motivates us in everything we doi love this book and will give it to friends i know please pray for me so i can share it to others as well and also put the jesus words into actionthank god.

just another one of those movies a bunch of young kids travelling somewhere and get cut up into pieces because some psycho wants their organs neither scary nor educationaltommy you are taking anatomy  and believe me this movie doesnt help you pass that class many scenes are too dark to tell what happened hear someone scream and some light streakes across the screen and the next thing you know someone has dropped it is okay to see it for free but not worth it when you pay for the ticket.

buena vista the company that releases disney films on dvd chose to not release anamorphic dvds when they first came to dvd si reao none of these films are anamorphically enhanced this means if you have a widescreen television you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture also these discs are absolutely barebones only featuring a dolby  soundtrack and a  widescreen presentation where are the extras i dont know about you guys but i am a mighty duck fan who is disappointed by the dvd release of this film.

thank god he stopped rapping but now this album sucks too glad it was free hes reppin cali too oh hell no the crazy thing is he tried working with some new and other producers like r kelly and timberland and they did him wrong there are only three tight songs numbers   and  all were produced by rodney jerkins he cant be his sister though this album proves ray j just aint got it maybe he could if he had just stuck with using rodney jerkins but the beats are not supposed to make you tight your supposed to make that beat what it is and more.

well i am i have to say in all honesty a true magnum fan in the past i followed them all the way to see them perform live and at there very best which was in my own personal opinionall the time  vigilante is certainly one of magnums finest examples of good solid heavy rock on any one given cd  need a lot of love is one of there finest along with vigilante of coarse  and there is also tracks like lonely night and midnight on there too  i personally have all magnums cds as im so into there genre of music and culture  i simply couldnt be without  but if you like a bit of live in concert magnum then i recomend that you get youre hands on magnums live cd .

bayard is a startlingly fine writer who has made a number of smart decisions with this novel its not a sequel to a christmas carol as some readers assume its a great thriller that makes just the right use of its source material slyly dropping in details that are a delight if you know your dickens but in no way detract if youre just reading it as a tightly contructed historical thrillerremarkable definitely a writer to watch.
  Negative
this book is the continuation of the story of tiny tim but as an adult the part where we see who tim really is as opposed to who tims parents wanted him to be was by far the best part of the book the mystery though was just sill.

the concept was good and it certainly worked in bayards poe novel but after a half dozen chapters i still couldnt care less about tim the prose tended towards the pedantic and the supporting characters were flat.

at a wimpy  minutes so much is left out that unless youve read the book a lot of what is happening probably wont make any senseavoid the movie but definitely read the book by my favorite author douglas kennedy.
  Negative
after being nearly obsessed with into thin air and the climb i eagerly awaited the latest book from lene i also lived in and speak danish  an added bonus however i found lenes chronicle pretty weak with little background or insight in the writing this book was written more like a journal without analysis and should have been billed as such for gaining insight into the state of mind for lene it was interesting for better writing and deeper analysis about the  tragedy stick to the other  books.
  Negative
this book is a total waste of time to read i couldnt wait to read it when i saw it on amazoncom but lucky for me i happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick to think that she thinks scott fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal she will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like fischer or rob hall save your money on this one i have read almost everything about mount everest and the  tragedy and this is by far the worst it will never compare with into thin air or the climb also she has a style of writing that i have never seen before she jumps from one thing to another but i can guarantee you it will always be about herself and how strong and great she is.
  Negative
its about being proud of being the first danish woman to do so  this sentence is the whole content of the book the most dramatic climbing season on the tallest mountain on the planet is nothing but a mere background to the great self esteem drama gammelgaard is going thru and sharing with us  in lots of details krakauer and boukreev run circles around this lady definitely not recommended.

even if you dont like this programme how could you not its worth buying simply to watch george eads the whole way through hes so hot the combination of a good cast and interesting if not often creepy storylines keeps me watching this show each and every week and i could watch all of these episodes over and over go out and buy this now it will get you hooked.

so someone from the biggest cult of all christianity makes the usual errors about alternative spiritual paths he knows nothing about pure ignorance and bigotryevangelical christianity had done far more damage than the new age ever could by sowing seeds of discord and division their fearbased dogma keeps them blinded to the light that is in otherstheir own book says god is lovetherefore where love is god iswhere god is love isthats what the new age is really all about its that simplebut many christians miss the boat they are stuck in fearperfect love casts out fear rightdidnt jesus say to love god and love your neighborwhy then do so many christians stay stuck in fearwhy do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others why not just offer their own spirituality in love to those who choose it and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice.

when i first heard this album i loved it after listening to it more closely i still like it a lot but am not quite so blown away by it when it first came out it might have been groundbreaking but so much has happened since in the world of technicalavantgarde metal that much of this album now sounds a little tame the material hasnt aged very well there are a couple of truly great songs in the middle all of the others are definitely good just not mindblowing as some of the material on their older albums still is the new vocalist on this album added a new dimension to the band a great improvement over snake in my opinion if you want a truly great album though get their next phobos.
  Positive
sorry i gave this album a few spins but i still cant think of a one good thing to say about it except maybe that it will probably be the weirdest thing youll ever hear cant say its not original but in this case thats not necessairly a good thing if youre not familiar with this band this probably wouldnt be the best album to start with.

beware this game does not work with windows xp the vendor said that it would work on any xp version except mediacenter but i have xp pro and it crashes there despite changing compatibility settings to older versions and changing the video resolution i suspect that its like another game we purchased that worked fine when xp first came out but windows auto update changed something that destroyed compatibility with old win  games like thiswe have it up and running on an  year old laptop with win   but its too cpu intensive to run properly on that old thingthe game seems ok for the right pc and operating system though.

this is the timeless classic which the term orwellian andbig brother are derived this terrifying look into apossible future in which the government big brother holdstotal control over the populace orwells vision of thefuture still holds very true to this day and is a mustreadfor anyone concerned about the future of technology andgovernmental controlhans chen.
  Negative
orwells futuristic  was a pleasure to read the detailed symbolism of the antique paper weight crashing onto floor as policemen bombarded in to arrest winston and julia the paper weight symbolizes the end of winston and julias private and secure existence which allow them to be safe with each other they found refuge in the small apartment where they could be themselves without big brother watching their every move its ironic the government was still able to scrutinize every moment of their lives i enjoyed reading this novel i recommend it to anyone who enjoys orwell.
  Positive
over all is a very boring book their are parts in the book that catch your attention but just for a while and then it just gets boring again i dont really like futuristic based books and the book  is a perfect example why i wouldnt recommend this book to any one unless your into this type of genre i give this book .

i was so upset to learn that this is no longer required reading in advanced english in high school i ordered it for my son because no one can be considered well read without this in ones history.
  Negative
i just read this for the first time at  wow what an eye opener the things orwell predicted in  such as the technology is amazing considering how long ago it was written the politics are messed up by current standards but frighteningly possible the tense mood of the book draws you in and there are moments especially near the end that would be truly terrifying to experience the chapter with room  i read with a shudderthe reason i didnt give it  stars is because it bogs down a few times i understand that this is to explain the world and how such a horrific existence came to be but a slow start to any book is rather annoying.
  Neutral
im surprised that noam chomsky hasnt been mentioned in any of the  previous reviews nineteen eightyfour is not just a supreme work of art it is politically relevant because the phenomena identified by orwell doublethink newspeak etc are in various forms actively used today in even the freest societies chomsky gives very detailed descriptions of this ive repeatedly found he says that when the audience is mostly poor and less educated i can skip lots of the background  because its already obvious and taken for granted by everyone curious.

what can one say about this book that has not been said beforeit is one of the most powerful works one can ever read which is forever fresh and remains relevant no matter what era it is read in.
  Neutral
this book is incredible so he wrote this book in like s i believe and hes writing about  about the future and he was right he does an amazing job writing about how the government controls the people about how the government uses propaganda how the government watches the people listens to the people this book is good if you care about the world this book is good if you are aware of propaganda and how people are fooled by it this book is good if you are someone who doesnt want to be controlled or fooledkindof like the way we are today sadly.
  Positive
though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracys manual i found the novel to be rather enjoyable the idea of how the world would be shaped and for what reasons was interesting and the narrator was able to lead the reader into the world and allow the reader to be engulfed into thingsthe end was well done and it was a good closure to the work the character does not die but he is changed indeed he awakens to thye doctrine of the state and accepts it yeah he has been tortured and brainwashed but he does not give in under that torture though seeds are definitely laidif you have the time and you like depressing books about totalitarian states that try to stamp out individual thought and reason go ahead and pick this book up if you want something lighter though i would try to find something else.

at first i did like the book then it just started to suck right around the time when winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend i hated the book so much that i forgot her name the first hundred or so pages i liked then it just got really boring so ii highly reccomend that you do not read this book and please for the love of god dont read that brave new world book by hoxley it is twice as worse as  to put it bluntly dont read any george orwell your just waisting your time.
  Negative
george orwell imagined the future in a dull state where every single thought emotion and action would be monitored by the government tells the story of winston living in a socialist country feeling depressed and then deciding to rebelorwell is able to convey the helplessness of winston as well as his routine by use of short snappy sentences however as the plot thickens orwell extends the sentences conveying wintons hope and rebellion is truly captivating and rather depressing as i read i saw everything in my mind as grey and broken but i couldnt put this book down.
  Negative
at first this book was not a book that i wanted to read it was assigned to me as an english project isu independent study unit so like every kid in high school i started to dread it as i started to read though the story started to get better and better there were points where i just wanted to continue reading and not put it down the story is very well written it gives you a very good idea as to what a dystopian world could potentially look like although at the beginning it does start out very slow it is a very good readif you read this book and enjoyed it also take a look at brave new world by aldous huxley it is quite similar to .
  Neutral
i had  ruined for me because i was forced to read it for school looking back it is a truly great book like many of the enduring works of science fiction its lasting popularity rests in the powerful archetpyes and metaphors it tapps into big brother the twominutes hate room  are all here whats scary is how some of this seems to be coming true  but big brother isnt so much the government as it is corporations just try getting away from a viewscreen nowadays also we watch the tv but the tv also watches us advertisers the internet and mtv control us more thoroughly than the government could ever hope to espire to instead of telling us we are at war with east asia we have always been at war with east asia they tell us what our values are what music we listen to what movies we watch etc we listen to britney spears we have always listened to britney spears orwell wouldve been so proud.
  Negative
ok maybe mr orwell intended it to be this way but it still doesnt hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the authors other works i read this book because i remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding animal farm years ago and this work was recommended by several of my friends if you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing check this out yes this is science fiction and just because some people call it a classic doesnt mean i like it if you want some of the best in this genre i recommend dune by frank herbert  a space odyssey by arthur c clarke or enders game by orson scott card.

i read this book for the first time in high school and found it mildly interesting i read it again recently and realized what an incredible piece of genius it really is the other thing i realized is that this book makes perfect sense as a satire of christianity big brother thought crimes room  it fits perfectly of course whether that was orwells intent i dont know though he was an atheist but i think the book is a masterpiece if analyzed in that way paul gehrman author kaleidoscope.
  Positive
for those of you who wrote that this novel does not make sense as a vision of the future and could never happen i would just ask you to look at nazi germany the soviet union from a historical perspective but then again there are  billion people in china who can not speak there mind without fear of being arrested and the government has control over how many children they can have thank god you live in a country where you can be free to read this novel the themes are as true today as when orwell wrote them the governments desire to control what people will think see clinton mans inhumanity to man see serbs and kosovo children please read the newspaper once and a while.

the moment i put this cd on and heard the light lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sunkissed gregorian chants followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat i knew this was going to be one journey id be willing to take for many years to comeand that was the impression i got from the first track alone imagine what ensued it only gets better from thereevery song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood and while i find this exotically soothing debut album by black ether an astonishingly overlooked group extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles id have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnicworld flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea.
  Negative
the cd isnt what i remember about liberace he was a great performer and showman on this cd  there is very little of his solo piano music very little grand piano type music at all most of what you do get is overshadowed by the background music i was disapointed.

this book could be useful if the examples actually worked i have barely reached the th page and all ready i have found more errors than should be allowed in an entire book the examples are misquoted and several dont work the book might be more helpful if the proof reader knew enough on the subject to correct the more obvious errors if you buy this book be ready to experiment with the syntax which may be close but not always correct.

westwest yall this album is good for what it is meant to be west coast gangsta music its all about lowridin smokin chronic kickin it and gangbangin in the golden state those who are accustomed to down south music will probably not like some of the west coast funk its a different flavor for some me being from cali i love this stuff it is rare that someone captures the essence of the west i do agree with this not being the best album but its still worth buying its got enough headbangers to get you to the club thats caliya   stars.

exit to eden is one of annes best works in my opinion many people were turned off by the film adaptation why hollywood decided no one would want to see a bondage film is beyond me eg but this book focuses on the relationship of master and slave and what happens when the tables are turned anne has many sides and lestat is just one of them true rice fans will adore this beautiful work of fiction.
  Positive
this book was hard to put down the story was excellent and the erotic scenes were just as good like all of annes books this one was very tastefully done well worth it.
  Negative
perhaps in its time this book was cutting edge but for those of us within the lifestyle its tame and contrived to a very unsatisfying degree its ironic that the film adaptation was watered down even more and turned into one of the worst movies youre likely to see ann rice didnt deserve such treatmentthere are books that capture the true essence of the bdsm fanatsy that are much more engrossing and interestingly enough ms rice has written them as well writing as a n roquelaure see her trilogy in the sleeping beauty series.
  Neutral
let me start by saying that i never put down a book even if i dont like it this is one that i couldnt even get past the first few pages maybe i didnt give it a chance but the foul language and vile event depicted in the first few pages turned me off completely to this book im glad it was a free download on kindle i gave it two stars only because i didnt give it a chance to get better if i hadnt deleted it maybe i would give it another chance but i certainly wont pay for it.

reviewer renee s nyc august  the plot is typical noir the hero typical worldweary and disillusioned hammett orchandler but the atmosphere is stunningit was a whole new world for me and i fellcompletely into it from vinnies first nightmare to the final dripping conclusionmr moores descriptions of thailand andthe thai people are evocative and real onecan feel the heat and humidity see the swirlsand flashes of colors and almost touch the waves of misery that radiate offthe pages and the storys not bad either i was interested in all the little tidbitsabout life in bangkok  and the storys not bad either there were a confusing numberof characters some of whom did not advance the plot at all and the plotting could have been tighter but allinall i would definitely recommend the book just be sure you read it in an airconditioned space because otherwise you will surely melt from its heat.
  Very negative
i thought this was the worst book i ever read there was no point and way to confusing he would ramble on about stuff not even importnat to the plot i hated reading this stay away from this book.

if it is then i will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces the book proves one point to me burning books and their society is much better than ours where farenheit  can be published.
  Negative
fahrenheit  was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover this book is very difficult to read the correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand the setting is also very hard to have a visual picture although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand i think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book but if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this i also think you need to be above the th grade or a very advanced reader.
  Negative
i dont give very many things five starsbradburys novel is simple powerful beautiful and truly marvelousa negative utopia along the lines of brave new world or  i like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately utterly hopeful bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressiveyou know the plot  they burn books because theyre scared of ideas montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society this book makes me want to change the world and so i want you to read it and then maybe memorize ita quick read and a fairly easy read engrossing enough that you wont want to put it down and once you finish it you might be tempted to just start over and read it again i recommend doing just that.
  Positive
wow what a great book about a dystopian society censorship and the need of the state to keep the masses blind deaf and dumb if you enjoyed  brave new world or the giver you must read this it is now one of my favorites.

to be perfectly honest i really dont understand how this classic is rated below a star by any reader yes i know that every reader has their own personal taste but this story is a classic for the ages every kid in a middle school should have to read this story about how lucky we are to be able to read books no matter what the content or agenda the story might containanyone who has never read this story should pick up a copy and start immediately its the best  you will ever spend.

confusing disturbing and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book firemen who start fires come on burning every book that exists this isnt a look into the future its a look into bradburys twisted little mind bottom line dont waste your time.

what appears on cursory reading to be a story of banned books with reflection is a comment on the systematic suppression of free thought and free speech the book gives insight into how those who look the other way or are concerned with rights only as applied to them can actually further the loss of individual freedoms a very thought provoking novel.

i have always liked this book to read so i thought i would get it on cd ray bradbury reads it and it is very bad it was so painful to listen to his voice i had to turn it off he reads in such a monotone voice it put me to sleep someone needs to remake the cds.
  Negative
this book doesnt deserve one star it deserves negative  stars this was the worst book i have ever read the book moved to slow and the characters are stupid guy montag the main character is a fireman who sets books on fire becuase homes are fireproof then he meets this crazy girl nmaed clairese who rambles about dumb stuff of the past that is not important like did you know that one time billboards were only  feet long instead of  who cares if there is one book that deserves to be burnt it is this.
  Very negative
this is definitely one of the worst books i have ever come across in the modern version there is a forword and an introduction both of them have nothing to do with the story and ray bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that no one cares about i almost fell asleep during the forword i dont know how i survived the book the book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace as for ray bradbury himself he states in the introduction that in his eyes hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book i think that this statement is pretty much self explanatory for his views on humanity great guy eh.
  Very negative
being only a teenager what i have to say usually means nothing or gets no credit i personally loved this book reading it just a day ago i was entirely captivated with the plot and the idea of censorship in the future and that it was precise that it being a book would be censored is unbelievable what possesses any person to censor a book that is so realistic it is amazing to actually prove to the writer that his writings are so precise is astonishing i would recommend this to anyone you dont need to love to read just know how to read.
  Negative
i felt the author of the book should of described the war a little more still i thought it had some very interesting perspectives on how the world might becomei thought it was weird how all the fireman looked the same the mechanical hound was a great part of the story it had us guessing if it would attack montag or not over all i felt this book was well worth reading.
  Negative
i was actually forced to read this book for a high school english class and fell in love with it its simply chilling in its portrayal of the future and the deliberate ambiguity about clarrise is very cool the deeper themes in this book make it one completely rife with feeling a very poignant book its definitely a mustread.
  Very positive
this book is a very important mustread for every person living in america at this time in history the paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the dumbing of america that is going on today are quite unnerving and quite scary this book should be required reading for everyone who has ever turned on the television to escape from the world which is just about everyone in this country.

i was at the foreign language bookstore on yanan road here in hangzhou when i saw this classic on the shelf would you believe id never read it we read some bradbury in school about  or  years ago and he didnt make much of an impression on me i cant remember why but knowing the fault couldve been mine i gave him another shot books are cheap here and hey its famous rightwell folks its famous for a damn good reason many in fact fifty years old and it is perhaps more relevant than ever but so what is it good writing does it entertain does it have real characters is it more than just an ohsocorrect theme dressed up as a novel oh yes it is its absolutely fantastic and i just plain cant recommend it enoughif you love scifi great if not it doesnt matter i can say transcends the genre with a straight face yes i can ill be reading this one again folks i didnt write it and im just sick with jealousy about it okay.
  Negative
being forced to read it in school for its so calledrelation to censorship sp i would have to say burn it althoughthe book is about censorship and whyhow it is wrong i cant say much good about it the theme itself is good but the story itself is trash one of the most unrealistic ideas ive ever heard first off everyone in the country is an idiot second that includes the hero third even those who have minds of their own have no intellegence and finally way to many cracks in the foundation of the story and two many holes in the story itselflr.

i read fahrenheit  this year in the seventh grade as a required reading as i read this book i got more and more confused the plot twisted and turned and left me hanging wondering wait what happened mr bradbury used large words that i learned as vocab i would recommend this book to no one under the age of about  maybe  i chose this age because of the hard concepts of burning books and the fastmoving plot of the hound.
  Negative
perhaps it is dated perhaps it was just built up too much but this is yet another book that came highly recommended both by other daytoday readers and critics alike that i just could not enjoybradburys tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise but it does not seem to follow through for me which is a shame  here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives but it is so boring that rather than get something out of it you just come away thinking how boring it isor at least i did.

i enjoyed this book very much because it gives you an extreme look towards censorship and how the media can influence the way we think an individuals ideas and thoughts are shunned for society in general.

hey a reader from missouri i hear you this book makes no sense what so ever and i had to read it for school i have no idesa just how in the world a book this horrible could have stayed around for  years i have talked to everyone i know and they all read the first  pages and immeadiatly hated it they rented the movie and watched some of it so they wont have to read it and it was verbatum and guess whatit was even worse than the book i do reccomend this book to all of youwell only if you want to find out how terrible books can get or you want to find out what type of flammable liquid burns better on books.

i first read this book for an english assignment at school after reading the first few pages i was completely lost bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic it is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot definetly not the greatest book in the world personally i hated the book.

i wont go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis after the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing annie starts out as a strong quirky individual by midbook shes so hung up on jake that she looses her charm and strength of character jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy the secondary characters problems just brought the book down further that and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well once again a female character meltspun intended i guess i had anticipated stronger female and male characters the ones i get from  i think ms wells shows promise but the next book ill get from the library.

considering the price of this card its hard to be disappointed i installed it into my freshly built system using a full version of windows xp as i write this i am watching an old episode of star trek tng on a small screen on top of aol the capture feature works great and the the additional goodiesfrom cables to a nice remote controller are exceptional i never use the enclosed driver disk with new hardware and the dv was no exception there is not any reason not to download the newest drivers for the initial install i have found it reduces many hassles speaking of hassles i have had none with this card windows xp is such an improvement for handling complex components like the dv i would recommend it over hassling over a maxed out win  system this card costs about the same as a prime d gaming card it provides dramatic capabilities ati has really done a great job with this card for the priceit cannot be beat.

as the other reviews noted there are problems with installing this card even though i got it working successfully in the end although it isnt my top pick for a graphics card i have enjoyed being able to hook it up to my vcr and print my digital videos to vhs yes this is possible although it is a bit tricky to setupi withhold one star on this card for having lack of customer support and being hard to setup if the user manual would have been more comprehensive and if the ati website would have had more help on the subject of installing this card the whole nasty ordeal of card setup that almost all night might have been spared.

joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus ulysses did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in thus it was that the artist while composing his next work finnegans wake got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys a poignant expression obviously of the searing torment boiling within himhappily for us the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume.

from a female hardcore lovers point of view i have just got to say that hatebreed is amazing by far one of the best hardcore albums ive heard in a while this album is full of raw true emotion  it makes me aware of where i am with myself as well as with others hatebreed goes further than just delivering a simple hardcore sound  they truly give it in a way that makes me feel the music it has the ability to take one to the emotional edge and back i would love to thank the band personally for creating and sharing thier sound with othersand for inspiring me.
  Positive
its interesting that hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of slipknot or limp bizkit when they now tour with bands like that its also interesting in light of the fact that their music is basically identical to any alternametal bands except without what little talent or melody those bands possess this band has as much to do with hardcore as sepultura i thought this was a joke band when i heard it f youre really interested in hardcore put down that jug of weight gainer  turn off your victory sampler cd and order a universal order of armadgeddon cd immediately and stop wearing so much adidas newjack.

the beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get van damme to the foreign legion where the real story and action begins right unfortunately the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies at least van damme didnt do the splits in this movie then again that might have given the film a memorable momement.

i had bought one of these for my old dog a large german shorthaired pointer who had a horrible pulling problem and it worked perfectly for him and he didnt seem to mind on the other hand i just bought one of these for my  month old coonhound and it also worked to stop his pulling but he hates it i cant take him for a walk without him trying to get it off atleast  times i think this may just be because he loves to sniff the ground so much that this kind of makes his head go higher up but now i have to order him something else to stop his pulling because of what difficulty it is to use this for him other than that amazing product in its self.
  Negative
this is probably a good product for dogs with square jaw lines but for owners of small dogs such as a lhasa apso or shitzu beware because of their flatter facial structures the collar slips off and wont hold as it should and speaking from experience the size is not the issue ie even a small size wont work.

this movie left me on the edge of my seat and short of breath once just wasnt enough in the theater i just had to see it again on the big screen i never used to be into movies with subtitles but the effect just isnt the same as it is in its native tongue just when i thought its over it just takes you on another turn and another and another if you like fast paced unpredictable action with a soundtrack that fits its movie like a glove this ones for you.

i am sorry but after reading this book i have to admit that the feminists are right men are pigs and the only reason this book was written was for the authors to make moneythe book tries to justify its existance by saying it is designed to help you find the love of your life on the internet it actually only helps you find the love of your night if i had actually used any of the tips in the book i would have had alot of sex but i doubt finding my soulmate would have been possible in fact i doubt anyone using this tips would find their ultimate mate it would be inspite of the tips not because of theman entire chapter is devoted to sterotyping women though the authors do try to explain most women do not meet these types then the list over  to watch out fori am glad i did not actually pay for this i would have demanded my money back.

i cant imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box  its tones are set in a specific pattern and it doesnt deviate from that at all but colleen somehow makes music boxes magical again by mixing the traditional plucked sounds with their reprocessed and synthesized counterparts she manages to evoke a fairy tale mysticism whats is a componium part  goes from thick sonics to singular tones at the end and even it charless birthday card relies solely on iterations of pop goes the weasel will you gamelan for me is its own creation immediately the tinkling comes fast and furious on whats is a componium part  a track that sparkles like moondust calypso in a box shows off the more processed side and has an almost senor coconut feel for its short running time the standout piece here is the final track ill read you a story which appeared on an earlier album but is always welcome anywhere.

i knew nothing of robert mcduffie until i heard him perform the mendelssohn concerto at wolf trap with the national symphony that performance led me to seek out this cd and mcduffies playing here is as lovely on the disc as it was in the live performance his tone may not be as big as itzhak perlmans but it is nevertheless exquisite the phrase spun silver though cliched is apt this is true concerto playing the soloist carrying on a conversation with the orchestra and by extension with the listener i definitely will seek out more of mcduffies discs and i hope others will too.

this movie personifies everything that is wrong with hollywood these days the characters are superficial the plot anemic and the special effects vastly overused liam neeson leads a cast of characters who spend a few days in a haunted house to gauge their fear reaction the house is possessed by the spirit of its builder who hates kids that is about it a terrible remake of the original  classic which was the best horror film ever made get the original and save your bucks by letting this one sit in the warehouse and rot.
  Very negative
okay if youre a special effects freak you might like this however there are much better films with equally good effects if youre a fan of minor things like say oh plot character development etc then stay away the  robert wise film is the scariest film ive ever seen and the scares come from what wise doesnt show you the  version was brilliantly plotted and paced with one of the greatest ending lines in film history the  version has none of this do yourself a favor and see the  movie or better yet read the shirley jackson novel the only reason this gets one star is because c zetajones is just so easy on the eyes.
  Negative
a truly horrible horror film over use of not so special special effects attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum and that the characters were never developed or interesting the only thing thats scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after  years the other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that i actually paid to see it.
  Very negative
ill admit it was years ago when i had seen part of this movie remake that was so bad so corny so awfully unscary that i couldnt even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through and i a lover of all things spooky i do recall however three things about this movie the directing was awful the script was terrible and cathy jones i didnt know who she was  she hadnt married the old man yet which really launched her career gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie no i speak in haste  there were a number of worst things about this movieif you want to be creepedout read the book the haunting of hill house by shirley jackson if you must see the story in movie form watch the old black and white original from  starring julie harris its dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigohappy hauntingnesswind in hare.
  Negative
is the house on haunted hill so different than the haunting both share the same failure a great old story that can be pictured every year and still make a good thriller but this movie makes it no better than a poor picturegood actors good story but not well told with its poor suspense the old classic movies with their limited graphics were much more successful.
  Negative
if you like supernatural mysteries then youd like this film it is technically a horror film but its really not that frightening though there is a scene in the movie that made my mother jump about three feet and as a result is not for people that watch horror films for the fright as a mystery however it is really quite good and deserves to be watched over and over just so you can find all the hidden clues for the answer at the end.
  Positive
no no no what went wrong bigbudget film with great actors and what do we get a visually appealing film with a completely flat liam neeson and a paperthin storyline catherine zeta jones tries to charm her way through but even though she does an okay job the movie is still bad lili taylor and owen wilson also try to add flavour to it all but cannot manage to save the day all we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content it all seems to be over before it really begins and nothing really makes much sense and the eerie mood is almost totally absent not a good omen for a horror movie is iti just cant believe what went wrong for neeson usually he drags a movie up not down watch house on haunted hill instead if youre into stuffsomepeopleintoahauntedhouseandseeifthesurvive movies then youll se how a proper haunting should be .
  Very negative
sad sad sadthe waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs catherine zetajones is a much higher caliber actress along with liam neesons lame attempts to make this movie palatable is such a crime almost as if the movies set was hauntedthe beginning of the movie has so much promise  you feel the backround of the centralized story has promise you get suckered into the premise this house has to offer  then and without warning the silliness beginsit is as if youve been thrown into an addams family reunion  the story line starts to wander the characters continue to wander and ideas and solutions popup without a warning or explanationto say a horror movie isnt believable almost sounds absurd but this movie gets you suckered in then throws you on the floor flatthis is a definite  do not buy borrow or rent just wait for cable.
  Very negative
the actors in the movie are a great bunch but when the plot is very weak you dont get very much i mean liam neeson hes a great actor but was very weak in this movie it wasnt scary at all the the end of the movie was bad there was maybe one scary part which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump that was all i dont recommend this movie to people who like scary movies bc it was a polar opposite.
  Negative
a fan of both jacksons novel and the  robert wise adadptation i went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming it was worse in fact it was so bad i laughed my way through it along with the two friends who accompanied me there are so many digital effects that the house seems alive indeed but computer geeks set free with a big budget dont creep me out theyre just annoying so is the movie the house shapeshifts sighs moanshell even the doorknocker gets a reaction shot zetajoness leather hipboots manage to outact her and lili taylor is hilariously bad as eleanor ive got the save the children wha liam neeson is even less interesting than he was in the phantom menace if thats possible lets just put it this way i just sacrificed  minutes of my time to write this review so that you wont waste  hour and  minutes of yours on this film.

the haunting with julie harris was so goodeven better for its black and white medium which enhances the sense of the macabre and general offkilterness of the set why dont they remake the wizard of oz now theres a picture that could be made much pertier with modern cinematography the cheap set and old theatrestyle acting throw a damper on whats still is a great universal story.
  Negative
this overdone remake of the brilliant  classic is sorely disappointing if it had been released as an original movie with an original title it would have worked the special effects though good were too much for this movie to bare.
  Negative
this  horror film based on the original the haunting is creepy in some ways but altogether its not really a great film at all it has good acting and the scares and popouts are clever things that boost my rating from a  to a  with an ending that isnt perfect but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart the film moves slow in the beginning and it starts to pick the pace soon after and later has its intense ending the film is ok in some ways but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win but it still isnt horrible i liked the house and the setting though that was cool the complete storyline was pretty good also if you want some innovative horror from  i suggest you get the blair witch project.
  Negative
i was originally looking forward to seeing this movie but after i did i wish i hadnt spent the money the story is lame the actors dull and the story is so changed from shirley jacksons wonderful book and the  movie that it doesnt even deserve to share the same title forget about buying this botched movie and purchase the older haunting youll wonder why they bothered to make a remake proving that newer doesnt necessarily mean better.

while i loved both movies jean de florette and the sequel manon of the spring i would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second they are both masterfully done and you really cant watch just one of them as they are an inseparable pair the first movie forming the background for the second and the second providing the resolution for the first without giving up too much of the story these movies tell a story of greed accidental murder and resolution with the likes of greek tragedycritically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime my only criticism of the nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision overall this flaw can be overlooked as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come.
  Positive
this is the second part of a two part series and picks up where jean de florette leaves off if you do not see jean de florette then you will be missing much of the background of this movie and the context is important for example without viewing the first movie the viewer will not know manons background what happened to her father and their farm the viewer will also not know the full relationship she has with the soubeyran clanthe quality of the dvd picture is avarage the picture is fairly clean and clear.

marquez book takes the reader through the lives and times of what i hope is an atypical columbian  family covering from roughly the s to the s it was fun in parts but oddly repetitive with a style that seemed half magic realism half freud and of course the standard enervating antiamerican diatribes were thrown in i guess a latin american author even in magic realism mode cant overcome his predilictions.
  Negative
the first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history its enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages unfortunately the book becomes one of the most overrated in historymany of the praises given say the book is difficult confusing and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book why why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good this is a parable with many characters magic realism a genre that deserves to be ignored though thats another discussion to give marquez credit his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under but it is nevertheless a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful and the intertwining of lives but they just dont move the story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all aboutmarquez book about miguel litton and news of a kidnapping are much better but this book just bores and bores.

im one of those obsessives who forces himself to finish any book he starts so i plugged away hoping id experience the enlightenment all these other reviewers seem to have foundbut i just didnt get it maybe it lost something in the translation but i prefer a little dialog in my fictioneven in my heavy pretentious intellectual and politically correct fiction i dont mind the magic realism but i do get bored with sentences that run on for twoplus pages without a period oh well chalk up the dissent to a libertarian crumudgeon redneck whos educated beyond his intelligence but i was underwhelmed.

i have read this book  times and i can read it  times more and never get tired of it this is what a great piece of literture can do this book has such unforgetable scenes that one cannot differenciate between dream and reality that exists in the story but takes over your mind and dont let go till you set aside the book and even after you will be captivated by the imagineray that has gone into this masterpiece.

i approached this novel with reluctance a friend recommended it but said it was best to read it in the original spanish i dont understand spanish but i decided to try the english translation i was overwhelmed for days i was in a trance i could not and did not want to pull myself away from macondo and the buendia family the words hypnotized me the scenes evoked haunted me during the day and filled my dreams at night gabriel garcia marquez has created a masterpiece in any language.
  Negative
as i opened this book i thought to myself wow this seems like a great story i found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page although the style and marquez technique are unquestionably wonderful the overlaying themes of lust lack of selfcontrol and immorality outweighed the good the goal of nearly very characters life is the sam.
  Positive
this is what i think my problem is i didnt like the translation of the book if the novel was written in spanish and then translated into english i would sit there and say to myself that i loved the descriptive but not the flow of the sentence i am compelled to give this novel another try based on these reviews it has been a few years and i feel it is well deserving.
  Negative
this translation of marquezs quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose the clarity and depth of hundred years symbolism and the excellent development of the buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time  a time of exploration political upheaval and social transition one criticism of this translation is the absence of footnotes to specific historical cultural or social elements of life in colombia in the past two centuriestaciturn silent insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house colonel aureliano buendia could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude p overall a great read.

im always up for another look at the titanic especially if new light is shed on the story unfortunately pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of ballards expeditions on top of that its not interesting the retelling of the events on the ship are fine but they cant carry the deadweight of pelligrinos attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story its the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting pass.

garbage is a band like no other you really have to take a listen to this amazing band to realize how one incorporates so many styles into one little albumthis album is packed full of classic garbage songs that can really give you the chills the opening track temptation waits was very eerie the first time i heard it and i loved it the next track i think im paranoid has that heavy bass and light vocals that the band is known for love the lyrics tooa great album for anyone looking to continue digging thru garbage a word of advice thoughdont bother with beautifulgarbage if you are a rock fandefienatley not impressive.

garbage deliver more terrific eurotrash rock on their second album s version  another mix of crunching guitars wild beats groovy keyboards  effects and the sensual voice of shirley manson the band are still the frontrunners of modern rock with such great rockin tracks as temptation waits i think im paranoid push it and my personal fave sleep together theres also playful poprock with special with shirley tipping her hat to the pretenders chrissie hynde at the end the delirious hammering in my head and the truly gorgeous you look so fine fabulous music  production from a fabulous band version  is essential garbage.

there are many better yoga dvds to choose from as a surfer there is no special surf yoga as opposed to regular yoga any surfer who takes the time to practice yoga will benefit peggys videos lack the vital instruction that beginners need to do poses properly without injury it is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community a better option is shiva rheas shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction and a yoga matrix which allows you to create your own unique routines most dvds become stale after awhile but the yoga matrix on shiva rheas dvd in addition to the  readymade routines prevent this dvd from ever getting old.
  Negative
this is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type if you have a basic knowledge of yoga you dont need this at all  you can create and tailor your own workout if you dont know yoga its useless the instruction is poor peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga no wonder the surf mags think its great with little very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga in some scenes you cant even see their feet a crucial failure  even if the instructor says what to do save your money take yoga long enough to learn it properly then apply it to your own surfing yoga is great for surfing but this is a poor video.
  Very negative
if you know anything about yoga do not buy this cd the only positive parts is the location and view of the waves this is more a novelty than useful honestly who does yoga in a wetsuit at pipelinetry ali mcgraws video for a great intermediate yoga tape.

this thing is ok but realize you must hold it onto your blow out port to make it work therefore you need  people to blow out your pipes when you are blowing out an rv constant air pressure is the key so saying that i ripped off the needle and attached an air chuck fitting to it now i just screw this on attach my air hose and pop on the compressor and i no longer need to hold it in place.

when i selected this book i was looking for a book i could share with young children ages  years and up to give them a glimpse of nigeria its people and culture i liked the photographs which accurately depicted various professionslifestyles in nigeria and some of them provide wonderful ideas for story book extensions for example the photograph of the grandmother making a traditional outfit could be complemented by presenting to the children a few yards of woven fabric that is typically used in nigeria for such outfits other professional roles we see nigerians in are baker doctor wood carvercarpenter lawyer potter blacksmith and finally the traditional native doctor or herbalist who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties all in all it paints nigerians as an industrious people which is what we are.

my son was very excited as we put the cd in the player but when the music started he was very unhappy the songs dont sound anything like the ones on the show the melody and pace are different and the performers arent interesting dont buy if you are familiar with the real songs.
  Positive
this is my first lou reed video i can honestly say that i enjoyed it i have gained some new perspective on lous music he is a true professional before i turned it on i knew i would like my favorites sweet jane and walk on the wild side but i found myself enveloped in the other songs which i had never heard before i was a casual lou reed fani think if i liked it then a real hardcore fan will love itthe video is high quality and the sound is great its like having a front row seat im glad i purchased this one.
  Positive
to jazzie of hampstead london dont know what you were looking at your last graf where you make up some quote from lou at the end of the show is totally bogus in fact lou says just the opposite pay no attention to that innacurate review lou has his good nights and his bad nights this was one of the best performances of his career.
  Negative
so far i really like it its very informative and useful i would have given  stars but i have it on kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper its difficult to flip through the book and find what you need but i am fairly new to kindle so maybe its just me or old fashion enough to prefer a book in hand but i do recommend it in whichever form you prefer.
  Positive
i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man i urge you to avoid it at all costs you will not notice the insipidly simple tune working its way into the core of your being and thus transform you into a similar state of insipid simplicity for kylie minogue i can find many uses  for her music i find none.

this movie is about two twins who look alike and they are on there own soccer teamthey switch teams without their mom nowing.
  Negative
i think this movie was great i just couldnt stand the bad acting of the guy marykates character liked he seemed to be angry at her even when they were just talking yuck.
  Negative
this movie had bad acting the dad is dramactic and corney the mom is just corney and all of the soccer coaches are acting like it was big pro sports championship the olson twins were corny but entertaining to watch this movie is unrealistic that emma ashley and sam mary kate were on  different teams its a rule that siblings be on same sports team this movie has bad quality actors and a unrealistic plot.
  Very negative
switching goals was very good the plot was better than the average mary kate and ashley movie but it wasnt as funny or had as good of acting as the others this movie is good to watch a couple of times but only a couple times if you have extra cash though i say get it you wont regret it.
  Negative
my son wanted this video so we got it there is a danger in making things that children think are real maybe a few more warnings in the video saying this is not real would be good.
  Negative
langston hughes is definitely a better poet than he is a novelist i found this book to be lack luster and boring although you may like a character or twoin general the characters were not developed nor were they intriguing his wording lacked the rapture that we are accustomed to him delivering.
  Negative
i really liked this book the characters were intersting and the relationship sandy had with his grandmother made me think of my grandmother the book would be good for young people to give them a idea of what black life was like back in the s and s.

it is a great suit great buy great service all around i would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a frosty suit to buy one of these.
  Positive
as other reviewers have suggested this book is full of errors i used this book along with the official guide and the rea book which is much better for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless there are so many errors that i found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that i didnt already know to be accurate which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide many of the mistakes are obvious but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in errorthis book is not worth the time.
  Negative
i just began using this book to review for the gre in april i havent gotten very far into the book but in the first  pages i have already found four seriously misleading errors and thats just the ones ive caught some of the equations even the hendersonhasselbalch they provide are wrong there is even a convenient example worked out with an erroneous equation you can use this book to learn about what topics you should study for the gre but do the actual studying from real chemistry textbooks.

this is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this cd are all of them if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do.

this is too small for the age of child its designed for i swear there used to be a larger version plus it didnt survive more than a few sessions of our play group before the spring broke.
  Negative
my  year old son received this as a christmas gift once it was initally setup he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger very gentle however after  rounds of play we were unable to get the teeth to pop back up or to get the rest of the teeth to push down needless to say he was very disappointed as was i does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one.
  Negative
i specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose it was to be taken on a trip to visit with my  year old grandson what fun we laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns well after less than a day the only tooth that would cause the jaws to snap was the center tooth not too much fun there i feel i wasted my money.
  Negative
yes this video is bad quality but it is great to see bowie and the spiders in their final concert bad quality or not im only  and obviously never had the privilidge of seeing them live so this is a great opportunity i believe the ziggy era was the most fascinating and exciting adrogyny is the only way to go.
  Positive
imagine action films were  minutes long there would be no time for subplots or romantic involvements or no you go on without me  all there would be is car chases and explosions godwills book is rather like thati liked itforget the measured blend of theory fact and example which is the style of oreillys authors this book cuts to the chase and it worksyou see tomcat is a servlet runner it isnt that interesting or even the best of breed jetty is way better tomcat is as interesting as what you do with it and goodwill drags you along through a flash tour of all the goodiesits a bit like a night tour of naples on the back of an italian cigarette smugglers vespa somehow at the end despite not having understood much you find you know your way around and feel comfortable exloring further on your owntake it or leave it thats just the kind of book it is.

gods and monsters is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director james whale  who directed frankenstein and bride of frankenstein the acting is superb especially ian mckellan in the lead i thought it dragged in a few areas but on the whole it was a great movie.
  Positive
one of the few recent films that i anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectationssir ian mckellen once again performs well the real surprise here is brendan fraser thanks to bill condons amazing screenplay fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to mckellens anguished and selfdefeated character make a point to get this one best screenplays consist of strong dialogue pacing and narrative the oscars are usually accurrate about that.

the manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed and the pole in the center of the tree was bent beyond redemption i have no idea how this tree looked all put together since i had to repack it and send it back thankfully amazoncoms return policy is generous and swift  they get five stars for service in the meantime it was a real tree for me again this year    i may try to go with an artificial one next year but will not order one online again.

of the  baseball books ive read babe the legend comes to life is my favorite creamer wrote the book while some of the oldtimers were still alive and this makes his story come to life if you want to learn about babe ruth this is the definitive book to read.
  Positive
this book was excellent the author gives us an intimate portrait of one of the greatest and most colorful athletes of the th century babe ruth overall we learn a lot about him and baseball during the roarong s into the smy only issue was that i didnt like the way the book abruptly ended with his death i would have liked to have read more about his funeral and the aftermath of his death plus i would have liked to learn more about how his legacy was treated the years after his deathnevertheless this book is a great read and i highly recommend it to any baseball or sports fan.

this is the first book ive read by meg wolitzer and overall i enjoyed it the plot brings three justturnedthirty friends into close and prolonged contact with the something mother of their recently deceased friend wolitzer is able to pull this off because she obviously likes all of her characters their various flaws notwithstanding she also has the type of sense of humor that allows her to ligthen things up when emotions and events threaten to drag things down too much the strongest character is the mother natalie who is one of the more appealing baby boomers in recent fiction and by no means a mere caricature my only objection is that several secondary characters are not as clearly drawn as the main ones but in fairness to wolitzer in most novels the reader would not even care about knowing more about such relatively minor characters and its only her gift for making you care that makes this an issue at all.
  Negative
the novel is a wrenching pageturner about a womans loss of an adult daughter and her subsequent attempts to cope and live the author artfully describes experiences of the mother and the dead womans friends as they provide each other with memories and support needed to adapt to the sudden death of a young woman whom they loved it is the best book i have read all year.
  Negative
i looked forward to reading yet another meg wolitzer novel and i was very disappointedin fact i lost interest early on and never finished it some of the authors earlier works such as sleepwalking and hidden pictures were excellentwhat happened.

i bought this bed recently for my  year old lab mix he doesnt dig chew or abuse things in any way so i wasnt concerned with getting a super abuseproof bed but after a couple of weeks of limited use i found a hole in the soft side of the bed the fact that this side attracts hair is unfortunate but a hole being made almost immediately makes this bed not worth buying it may have been a decent design if it was made with sturdy materials very disappointing.

if you follow my reviews you know that i am anglo catholic and that the  versions i use most are the good news and the original revised standard i have respect for the king james the new king james the jerusalem the english standard version and the holman christian standard i do not like the niv or the nrsv onto the subject at hand the nasb is widely praised as the most literally accurate version it does not contain the apocrypha but being that this is a protestant bible we cant really hold that against it the nasb is widely accepted in protestant churches for the most part it is carefully literal i consider it an interesting cross between the revised standard and the new king james my one slight complaint is that it is not quite as beautifully written as the revised standard but that said the new american standard is excellent.

the examples which were given in the textbook were way too simple when you compare to the homework problems never explain how to do bode plot at all i am glad i know how to do differential equations before taking the class otherwise to use the method that taught by this book i would be dead they never explain well on those differential equations and the concept behind.
  Negative
a book with a heavily religious slant anyone expecting a scientific discussion of sexual addiction should be prepared to read that god has responded to the arrogance of the human heart by turning people over to the control of their evil desires.
  Negative
as a psychologist specializing in the field of sexual health i am utterly shocked and dismayed at this book for those suffering from sexual addiction or for their partners who are looking for some peace please do not invest in this propaganda this book is not based on the science of either psychology or sexual health and is nothing more than the worst aspect of religious dogma and will ultimately result in further suffering this type of hate mongering intolerant uneducated mindset is what has led to many of historys most devastating atrocities done in the name of god a basic ethic of psychology and counseling is that that counselor or professional does not impose his or her own values upon their patients shame on you for writing such a book and calling yourself a counselor you are an embarrassment to those of us who have dedicated our lives to trying to relieve human suffering.
  Very negative
this book was suggested to me by a counselor i was seeing to help me deal with the fallout of my husbands confession of sexual addiction we both read the book and it truly helped both of us to understand some of the underlying issues associated with this addiction there is so much information in this book and i would highly reccomend it to anyone facing this kind of situation.

i recently replaced my  year old velodyne fsr with the dd i did so because the fsr was struggling in our new house with larger great room and because the dd was on sale due to its being replaced soon by the dd plus at considerably higher pricethe dd is cruising in our new house it really provides the bottom end that my klipsch heresies cannot and it does not run out of steam at high volume like the fsr didi am mainly a music guy not so much into home theatre the dd brings music to life and makes the singers and instruments seem to be in the room with you everything you need is included and the calibration software is a snap to use the cabinetry is first rate i got the cherry finish and although i cant tell if it is really cherr.
