1,contrary to other reviews i have zero complaints about the service or the prices i have been getting tire service here for the past  years now and compared to my experience with places like pep boys these guys are experienced and know what theyre doing  also this is one place that i do not feel like i am being taken advantage of just because of my gender other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars and have sucked my bank account dry but here my service and road coverage has all been well explained  and let up to me to decide  and they just renovated the waiting room it looks a lot better than it did in previous years,"{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.3909}"

-1,ok let me tell you about my bad experience first i went to db last night for a post wedding party  which side note is a great idea  it was around midnight and the bar wasnt really populated there were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything the two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at kind of counter productive if you ask me   i stood there for about  minutes which for a busy bar is fine but when i am the only one with my card out then it just seems a little ridiculous i made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away i finally had to walk to them to get their attention  i was standing right in front of them smiling and they didnt ask if i need anything i finally said are you working and they gave each other a weird look i felt like i was the crazy one i asked for a beergot the beer  in between that time the other bartender brought food over and set it down she took a fry from the plate right in front of me and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar what the hell i felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks  not an established db   i was just really turned off from that experience   the good is that db provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up i remember going here with my grandparents when i was a kid and it was the best treat ever we would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games this place holds some really good memories for me   its a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards i held for it,"{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.9579}"
-1,i used to love db when it first opened in the waterfront but it has gone down hill over the years the games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality it takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil the atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people now it is run down and many of the games are app related games fruit ninja and d experience rides with such games you cant even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens last time i went back in the winter many of the games were broken which made for a negative player experience i would go to db to play some games again in the future but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets,"{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.78, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.9389}"

-1,when i think bbb i think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tuneup and a few fixes are long gone      this review is more for the repair end of bbb in their defense bbb does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike ie colnago that you just dont find anywhere else in pittsburgh   at bbb i was charged  for a tune up and a few other things granted this included installing a sew up tire which i can understand would cost approx  swapping out a left side big ring shifter on my down tube this should have cost approx  at most and installing new bar tape cost of tape  and  to install so whats with  for a tune up well the story goes like this  i bring the bike into bbb prior to the nice weather hitting pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my oclv trek  ready for the season turns out i dont hear from these guys a week goes by two weeksi think thats ok i have two or three other bike i can turn to for a ride then i wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure ill get a call from them re my bike is ready to rollbut no dice so i call turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was reinstalling the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out is that my fault he says should be ready in a few days so i come in a few days later to this mammoth bill i ask if i am paying for the labor of taping out the screw i dont think i ever got a straight answer i look at the bill and cant see a good breakdown of the charges normally i would duke it over a bill like this but i figuredi had somewhere i to be  minutes ago and at least i finally have my bike i would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over overhauled but it wasnt  well bbb ill give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great nice wrap plus ill toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles maybe i would have rated bbb higher if i was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair,"{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.9842}"

1,at the dbgs for the first time ever a couple of months ago to check out the venue for my daughters wedding from the very beginning amber that young lady who worked with us was professional on the ball and organizedfar more than i can say about the wedding planner i believe she must be the parks event coordinator and totally rocked it   the place is truly beautiful so different from what a traditional garden looks like read the other reviews and the other folks will give you a much better idea of the type of plants bugs small animals or as my granddaughter loudly proclaimed  the birds with the hats   there were four other wedding going on the afternoon  but we never really heard much except for some far away music signs were clearly posted leading the way to the wedding site and the rehearsal the night before and the restrooms were exceptionally clean and pleasant to use   there was a very large room with shuttered windows and ac where my daughter and her wedding party dressed and a smaller similar room where the groom and his group readied themselves after the wedding as the chairs and such were put away the entire group came back to the same area which is a small courtyard and had a cocktail hour   my daughter and her husband were married in the far back arena where they have the outdoor concerts and therein lies the only reason this wonderful place does not get five stars   if you have your wedding at this particular site park your car in the dirt lot that is adjacent to the unloading area it is the first right as you come into the park and has a sign posted that reads service area only i understand that during the afternoon the park may want you to stroll leisurely through the park enjoying the natural beauty of the place but at the end of a very long day it wouldve been so much better to park in back and take a  min walk as opposed to an agonizing  min stroll  it was incredibly hard for some of the older folks in the group making their way back to the cars and by the time the wedding ended it was late and the only rangers we saw were on our way out   it was also very dark there and the lights on the canopy over the wedding table did not come on for a long time but eventually they did and it was truly breathtaking you may want to have someone be the on the watch for this so the wedding party doesnt eat in the dark lovely place to have a party or wedding parking not so great   thank you dbg for making my daughters wedding so very memorable,"{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': 0.9937}"

1,tried this place on a lazy sunday evening at the recommendation of other reviews and i would say what others have said is pretty accurate it is very authentic looks like a total dive from the outside and its in a hispanic neighborhood but the tacos here are great now just to be clear these are street style tacos they are small but they are only each which seems pretty reasonable   i ordered an adobada al pastor carnitas and a shredded beef with red chiles each were very good in their own unique ways the meat was good quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor the adobada was the standout in my mouth so much that i had to go back and order another one i also had a side of rice and beans which were good but nothing out of the ordinary   so far so good right the only slip up this place maybe has is that my girlfriend that was with me who doesnt eat meat was not overly impressed she got a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco the shrimp taco looked good and she said everything tasted alright but she was not wowed like i was about the quality of the tacos she did enjoy the beans and rice though so this place might not be the best veg friendly location but im not really going to take off for that because it is very authentic and veg friendly isnt necessarily what they are trying to do they are trying to make good traditional tacos and that they do that very well   they also serve beer here and i love the way its served your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted salted and has lime juice in the bottom speaking of bringing you the glass the service is wonderful our server was very friendly patient nice and helpful   all in all if you are looking for a good taco shop nothing fancy and authentic this might be your best bet or at least it is from the places i have been so far,"{'neg': 0.037, 'neu': 0.75, 'pos': 0.213, 'compound': 0.9979}"

-1,i really hate to give this place a less than stellar review because i want to like it so badly the location is great far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like youre in a more urban area big family style benches allow for friendmaking outside and individual tables inside im surprised i came back after the first time on a busier night we couldnt get service to save our lives we made sure we werent stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat staring at servers running around us for  minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead we sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so i could merely ask where the bathroom was atbut nothing i even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after  more minutes we gave up apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word that being the last straw our feelings a little hurt and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service we left half full beers and walked out upset i still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong  now we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent for mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that i usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for i dont see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that i like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friendscoworkers we still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but i cant seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth bummersville,"{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': -0.7874}"

-1,stopped into this shop during spring training  the staff was nice but he really pushed the kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop  we bought  of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them  the cigars didnt draw well and were generally not very good  we went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent  there the day before and only bought the kristoffs on their recommendation at  a stick  we wont be going back,"{'neg': 0.069, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.055, 'compound': -0.1294}"
1,i dont know why others had such a problem with the owner petey i went in for the first time last weekend and he was just fine perhaps its because ive learned over the years how to communicate to boutique shop owners that im not just looking but im on a hunt for the perfect fucking end tables and i hate chrome  you would be surprised how far that approach goes at any place tell the owner what you like and dont like right away letting them know you have an opinion allows them to engage with you as someone who appreciates desig,"{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.763, 'pos': 0.159, 'compound': 0.876}"

-1,hubby insisted we had eaten here before i thought not i was partly right as we have eaten at the good egg before and not been very pleased hubby had hated their crepeeggs we didnt know the connection between the two restaurants before we sat down  starving i order their farmhouse eggs benedict and hubby orders their breakfast quesadilla and an oreo pancake he just had to try it we both get iced tea and it tastes funny like it was made with bad tap water when the food arrives hubby inhales his quesadilla but says nothing about its quality the oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table i gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy the only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs the turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right its not crispy and the taste is off the biscuits taste like they are from a mix to top it off the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table nice can you at least pretend you didnt just give me the leftover water from someone elses table our server never returns to fill our tea except when dropping off the check or even to see how things are maybe he knows better than to ask,"{'neg': 0.1, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.3692}"
-1,the first time i experienced the eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room as i walked through the restaurant i was surprised it was so busyi mean this is a breakfast place right   the decor is very outdated with knick knack cutter everywhere i am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants i can see why old people love this place   i ordered the taco salad for my lunch what a disappointment almost bad iceberg lettuce a sprinkling of all other toppings no beans so if you want any protein you have to pay  extra to add chicken this salad was not worth  with a  iced tea and a  added tip to the bill i got out of there for  i will pay  for a weekday lunch but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food   yesterday i went to the eggery again with nico and his grandma after church maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch same awful decor but it seemed a bit more charming at am   i had the berry blintz crepes which were pretty good stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt mixed berries cottage cheese and a little bit of cream cheese whipped cream toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes it seemed like a lot of food for  a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad   i am not in any hurry to return to the eggery although my business group meets there every week nico did point out that i have been here twice now and have yet to actually try any egg dish maybe next time,"{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': 0.9666}"
