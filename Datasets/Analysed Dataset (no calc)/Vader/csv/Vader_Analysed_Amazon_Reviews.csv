1,i agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although i am a little biased kerouac is my favorite author this book inspired me to write a poem after i finished reading it and although it may not inspire you to do anything at all it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if youre an artist i read on the road the town and the city and just before this one the subterraneans which i found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were  or  pages long  this one was much more fun to read and i could not put it down if you really like jack you should also check out james baldwin and norman mailer,"{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.167, 'compound': 0.9543}"
1,less plot more pot than on the road where kerouacs most famous novel was all about reckless travel music girls and rebellion dharma bums is more introspective lots of meditation soul searching and existential ruminations about life truth and nature my only regret is that i didnt choose the book format as it was hard to keep up with all the philosophical ramblings while listening in the car,"{'neg': 0.112, 'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': -0.3657}"
-1,im amazed at how many people find the dharma bums worth reading its kerouac at his flattest the sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty there is virtually no action and the buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived this is definitely not a kerouac book to recommend readers would to better to pick up a copy of desolation angels or excepting the  pages of transcribed conversation in the middle visions of cody if youve already read lots of kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart pick up vincent czyzs adrift in a vanishing city  lyrical experimental hothouse writing that takes a quicktalkin drifter out of his native kansas as far afield as berlin mexico city and paris and through it all he never loses his vernacular even when waxin metaphysical you might also try sliding over to henry miller  not tropic of cancer which is his most popular but sexus which is far better written,"{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.151, 'compound': 0.9445}"
