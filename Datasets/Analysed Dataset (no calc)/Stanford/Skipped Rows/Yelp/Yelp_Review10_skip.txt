Row 1000
the only reason im giving this place two stars instead of one star is because i really had a good appointment with whitney padgett the nurse practitioner she was kind downtoearth smart and a good listener however in the end it was the doctor and one of the front office staff members who are the reasons why i wont return to this practice as a yearold married woman who moved to scottsdale from ca i was hoping to establish a relationship with an obgyn here in the valley so that i already have a trusting relationship with a doctor when my husband and i decide to have a baby i was a happy patient of my last doctor for  years  i scheduled my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was seen by whitney padgett it has always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time going to a specialist i was a bit shocked that i was seen only by whitney and never a doctor at all even though i was new to the practice this aside i returned for a second appointment and this time i saw dr carol hahn i came to my appointment with dr hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment so naturally i was a bit worried from the moment she walked in dr hahn was curt and condescending she spoke to me as if i were below her im a professional working women who is married to a doctor she typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact and at one point corrected me as i was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam however the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if i was a teenage girl are you sexually active i know this is a standard question but my chart indicates that i am a married woman and that i take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention do you think she could have read my chart or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice as i left this appointment i was paying my copay and getting ready to head to work i was told that i could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment i explained that i had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail i was told that i could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there when i explained that im still within the due date and that i have it ready to go in the mail the lady told me that i would need to wait for a manager to approve it before i could leave i told her that i needed to get to work and that i did not have the time to discuss this i put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door i can tell you that i will never return to this practice again from the level of care i received to the treatment and finally the billing practices this place was an unpleasant experience.
