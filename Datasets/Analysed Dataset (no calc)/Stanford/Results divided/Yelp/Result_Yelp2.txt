awesome tortillas awesome salsa pretty good selection of latin american food products mostly mexican but lots of scentral american and caribbean  im spoiled from all the hispanic grocery stores in atlanta but this is the best one ive found in the burgh  prices are average for the strip and pittsburgh but a little high for a hispanic grocery store.

even a nyer was telling me to get tacos here so i did pretty good loaded more than im used to they make their own tortillas which is respectable its fun to watch people order tacos here this is a real taste of mexico and it seemed new to half of them pittsburgh is a great town because the vendors arent afraid to give the people something real  they even have tongue   that chinese food truck across the street though its good but way americanized.
  Positive
yes i went and had the tacos yes the lengua tacos yes i know they were good did you also know that you can buy homemade tortilla chips in hella bulk along with any kind of sauce you can imagine if you suddenly need plantains for a questionable contribution to a fireside potluck you can get those here too im not sure what else you can really ask for in a mexican food store nope pretty sure theyve got it all oh if you buy a plantain that is pitchblack or you find that your plantains at home have gone pitchblack simply slice them open place in oven bake until warm and tender then spread with guava paste available at reyna foods so the man at the counter tells me true story.

i went here for the first time on saturday night i had to go  try the famous giant fish sandwich when it arrived i was impressed the fish was even bigger than i expected  the batter was perfect also the beer menu is lengthy they serve beers from almost every corner of the world i thought about trying something new but turns out i was homesick for a good old pennsylvania beer  rolands is definitely a cool place in my book ill be back p.

i hesitate to even write this review because technically we didnt eat here  but after reading the other reviews i thought eh what the hell  we came in and were seated at pm for dessertsdrinks   by  we still hadnt seen our waitress  we decided it wasnt worth it and just left  i did eat here a month ago and yes  the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy  and then to pay around  for that  lol  right  i wont be back.

the people arent lying this lobster roll is drenched in butter and guaranteed to be a key contributor in your untimely death you better love it or leave it alone.

there were  of us on a beautiful sunday afternoon surprisingly rolands was  full with  waitresses they were running to fill orders  the fish was hot and crispy it was fried but it was good the french fries with it tasted as if they were fried in the same grease or an oil that shouldve been changed several days ago  the mussels were ok  but the clams casino were inedible the clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping the crab cakes were also bad both went back  the waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine  the new england clam chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup  no we wont go backthe food was lacklusterbetter fix at wholleys and the service was terrible it took  minutes to get someone to take the bill.

prime time location and they know it  yet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it  the place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city  i have always steered clear of rolands because of an assumption  butthe wife and her friend wanted a lobster roll so i was roped into going  i opted to just drink a draught  they got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed  the sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries the best part  it also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw  the roll itself was lobster but was fishy tasting and had no sauce  there was maybe ozs of fishy lobster on the rollpathetic service was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves  go to wholey.
  Negative
if  stars were possible id give em got back from here yesterday evening and i am physically ill   i didnt even touch the anemic yellow and fishy smelling muscles  not that the waiter asked why we hadnt eaten them more on this character in a moment my ahi tuna steak was decent but i think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well just saying  check your food before the waiter walks off  speaking of the waiter  one of the worst ive ever had the displeasure of umm being served by that sounds awkward and vaguely jackassy  hmm the mild poisoning i have is affecting my wit but you follow me  this guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down and didnt notice or say anything about it when he di.

last weekend my mother and i headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods  lunch meat and cheese from penn mac  veggies at stans  needed some new spices from penzeys for a chili i was going to make that daywe were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping  we parked in front of rolands and see the sign famous for lobster rolls and bloody marys  perfect   my mother got the lobster roll which she said was good the bread from mancinis was of course tasty  toasted and buttery  delicious mostly because it was mancinis bread i had the lobster roll minus the carbs on a salad  and the lobster was tasty no doubt  i mean lobster is just  good for the price though not sure that i got enough bang for my buck the salad was something i could have picked up at getgo in the premade section i just didnt feel satisfied at the end of my meal i couldnt even drink my bloody mary this is a rare affair way too much horseradish and i often like horseradish in my bloodies  and it was cold  didnt even take my winter coat off so needless to say not the best experience  talk about false advertisement.
  Negative
warning  this place is for suckers only  funky smelling worse tasting seafood  overpriced  raunchyunclean restrooms  only reason anyone goes here is because this is a tourist trap  type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything as pt barnum once said   theres a sucker born every minute   stay away  any other restaurant will be better .

i liked the bar   the food not at all first time here wife and i sat at the bar and people watched over some well poured drinks   strong point  then we screwed up and ordered food   i got their infamous lobster roll  glad i had a drink  overcooked and dry dry dry i thought lobster roll was generally made with a lobster saladlike mix  this lobster was dry and chewy  lots of it though  i guess that accounts for the high price   i went down to wholeys and got a much tastier one for  bucks  and wifes nachos were just a big pile of chips with some toppings thrown on the top  then the other day  we went back and i tried pizza  yuck  the toppings were terrible pepperoni sausage  how can youscrew that up but they did  two slices and boxed it up so as not to hurt the waitress feelings  but it went into the trashcan down the street  go for the hootch and not the food.
  Negative
i would give them zero stars if it were an option no one came to wait on us i had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter well call him mr personality because he never did tell us his name i should have known we were in trouble when he didnt bother to write down our order my caesar salad came without the requested onions my grilled salmon was overcooked the vegetables were bland the waiter took away my halfempty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water he never offered us dessert the rest rooms were filthy i would never recommend this place to anyone.
  Negative
i cant believe this place got a bad rating sure its not a star restaurant but you cant beat the price or the food why would you order french fries at a greek restaurant i want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place  i live about a block away from salonikas and i absolutely love it the first time i went in i noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty very good sign trust me sure there are no waiters you order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready but ive never had to wait more than a few minutes  the food is absolutely amazing and cheap my boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta which is exactly what it says it is pasta with chunks of chicken it is lightly seasoned but no heavy sauces and its amazingly filling  i always get the greek salad or the pastitsio the greek salad comes loaded with onions feta olives and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade and there is always enough dressing homemade dressing at that  the pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste its like a greek lasagne but without cheese it consists of a large layer of very spiced beef then layers of noodles and a cream sauce  i bring a lot of friends to salonikas when they trek downtown to hangout with me and every single person i have introduced to this place absolutely loves it i usually make them get a gyro and i cant tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good the gyro meat is fresh in fact they carve it right there  there is also a bar in the back of the restaurant i kind of wish it wasnt there because it attracts some unsavories and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant but you cant win them all keep in mind that this is a cashonly establishment so hit the atm on the way  you will not be disappointed with this place this place is really a gem.
  Negative
sorry but i stopped in this morning to get my lunch because i knew i would be too busy to go out for lunch  got a greek salad  first of all there was no lid on the salad it was wrapped in plastic wrap what anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble  second when i went to eat it i threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown andor wilted  not going back again  i didnt spend all that money for garbage.
  Negative
the sicilian pizza is huge tasty crusty on the outside soft in the middle  the regular thin crust pizza was loaded with toppings  my only complaint is that the pizza was served luke warm  i want my pizza piping hot almost burning the roof of my mouth  the overall taste made up for the temperature difference and i was happy with the overall experience  both the cooks and the waitress were friendly.
  Negative
this place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising some of the food was good and others were subpar  two of us ate the gyro platter which comes with  hummus watery  pita store bought  gyro meat ive never had gyro meat like this before it was ultra thin and had a rubbery texture  also the portion was so small  greek salad iceberg with sparse toppings and too much dressing  grape leaves vegetarian but quite good  and rice actually this was the tastiest thing on the platter  it had a nice lemon and chicken broth flavor   overall the food was hit or miss the most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat my companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable i think diners come for the cake which was eaten by almost every person in the joint   i also have to agree with some of the other reviewers this place is disgustingly dirty all patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross the kitchen was not clean and our waiter had food on his hands when he served us   even homemade wine and honey soaked cake wont bring me back again.

there has to be better italian food in pittsburgh  i dont know why anyone would come here  i had an overnight field trip with my students to pittsburgh  the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show  they had us sectioned off which was great for privacy  also since the students were loud  their service is a hot mess  they only had  waiters serving our  person group  it was not organized at all  just getting our drinks out was confusing  the waiters just came out with any drink  then asked  anyone order this  this is why my table sat drinkless breadless  saladless for the longest time  for our dinner we were given a salad entree  tiramisu  the salad was definitely straight out of the bag  doused with some cheap dressing  it didnt taste fresh at all  there was a list of  or so entrees we could choose from  they came out quite haphazardly  i unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo  worst ever  i could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar  i tried to douse it with pepper  cheese but alas it did nothing to help it  some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked  the tiramisu also was gross  it definitely was made  cut awhile ago  just kept cold in their fridge  the redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor  old fashioned coin operated games and the mystery show  ive never been to one  was really excited  they started after we ate our entrees  intermissioned during dessert  the actors were super funny  interactive  my students loved them which of course makes me happy  seriously though their food is so bad.

came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building no hostess no wandering servers no customers we had to search the place for someone to seat us and the first people we ran into were a couple of offduty servers who were rolling silverware the male kindly sat us and got our drinks for us it took a ridiculously long time for our server to even appear at our table and just as long for our food to come out to make everything worse the only other couple in the restaurant who were sitting behind us were complaining to the server about their food the server returned to their table a bit later no manager and said that the manager told him that since the food is made early in the day it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served what seriously it was hard to enjoy our food at all by the time it arrived  the food left much the be desired the service was the worst ive ever encountered i dont usually leave complaints on restaurant websites but i had to leave one for this terrible visit they gave us a coupon for a free appetizer needless to say we did not return to redeem it.

really marvelous art presented in a beautiful setting  the gift shop is one of the best in the city  they feature crafts from artists around the world and local  shows are well lit and well presented  downstairs are studios where they teach classes on metals wood fiber mixed media and bookpaper arts beginning to advanced they do a great job of hosting outside events and fundraisers.
  Very positive
this review is for the sam bok food stand  i found a review kind of for it but i feel as though its good enough to have its own review  plus my gal from china express now closed was downtown cooks there so i had to make it happen  this place is simple  it has chicken on a stick mung bean pancakes  i think some sort of spring roll  the only thing ive ever tried is the chicken on a stick and really its all i need  these little thingers are delicious and theyre only     they have two different sauces to dump on it and i get it with bot.

i used to buy la prima espresso for my pavoni all the time so i was pretty excited to actually get a cup of coffee here  i ordered a cappuccino  it tasted like milk and no coffee  i was exceptionally disappointed  so while the place has a great reputation  even they can screw it up if they dont pay attention to detail and  at this level they should never screw it up i had a better cup at martys market for crying out loud.

i began attending the midwife center for wellwoman care about three years ago then chose the midwife center as my care provider when i became pregnant with my daughter a year and a half ago  i cant say enough good things about this place from the inviting atmosphere to the knowledgeable and supportive midwives to the very helpful nurses and lactation consultant  my daughter was born in the forest room and it was everything id hoped for  one of the saddest parts about leaving pittsburgh for me this past summer when we had to move for my husbands job was having to say goodbye to the midwife center  i am hoping to find someplace half as wonderful in our new city.

the location of redfin blues is great it overlooks the river and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks however the food and service is sub par each time that i have been here whether it be an extremely bustling saturday evening or a slow weekday afternoon the service has been poor the food is average and is way overpriced there are many other great places in pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich   redfin blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant but with the poor service and average food it has a lot to yearn for.
  Positive
stars for the atmosphere there are not many places in pittsburgh to dine along the water and the outdoor seating at redfin blues is fantastichuge outdoor deck with lots of tables under umbrellas it was the perfect venture for sunday funday and i dont know why i have never been here beforewell it is pretty hidden they have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself  it wasnt crowded so the service was fine but i could see on a busy friday or saturday the service would be less than stellar we drank a beer they only have bottled beers and sat by the river to watch the boats go by  the beers are pricy as our curious traveler shandy was  each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day  the menu is mostly seafood and priceythe buffalo shrip where you only get  was   it was only pm so we went with an appetizer of cheese fries with bacon and ranchdelicious and how could you go wrong the fries had a tasty seasoning on them.
  Negative
the steaks here are very good  its the same quality as the other high end places prime cuts aged etc  however i love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter  thats something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops  i love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table  i had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isnt that good  the  bartenders are competent but the atmosphere is pretty lame  its kind of an afterthought it seems  oh yeah and they dont have guiness on tap  im going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap  i mean how do you not at a steakhouse  if you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere  the service is very good  the crab stuffed mushrooms are okay but they certainly arent noteworthy  the mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay but i think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat something you cant get at the local grocery  overall a very fine experience  id rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners mortons capital grille  ruth chris hyde park  and for bar area and bar dining capital grille hyde park mortons ruth chris.

apparently i wasnt important enough with my lunch burger order even though it was  because my server did not come back to see if it was cooked medium which it certainly was not when i finally got a chance to ask about it she acted indignant that i would question her then checked her pad yes i ordered medium then she stared at me stared   i have to say i have never felt smaller in any restaurant experience in my life extremely disappointing and appalling will give our business to capital grille from now on i urge you to do the same.

my girlfriend and i were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel this was the third of three gay bars we went into that night we didnt even have a drink at the second one and it was by far our favorite not a lot of female patroons so if youre a lady on the prowl i would probably go somewhere else but if you just want to relax in a comfortable friendly atmosphere with some decent music this is the place  there were two bartenders and we happened to sit on jeffs side im sure they were both quite capable but jeff was amazing at making us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up even then he made sure we were taken care of hes pretty much amazing and has great eyebrows  i guess there was some craziness and fighting by the door and outside as the night got later but we never saw it and it didnt clear out the whole bar i would expect a downtown bar to have a few problems and it seemed like they were taken care of efficiently no strikes there  we stuck to beers and the prices were very reasonable considering the downtown location apparently happy hour runs until midnight we were able to both have some drinks on the cheap and listen some good music definitely returning whenever were there again.
  Negative
so fun to have a place like this in the strip  i just found out that they have chocolate oranges  i look for these in all the stores during christmas and never thought to come here  well they have white milk and dark chocolate varieties available yearround  i love the dark chocolate but only because i didnt know the other two kinds existed  they also have canisters of malted milk balls unique chocolates from all over seasonal items and a cafeish area  i didnt try the hot chocolate but i hear its a musthave  while we walked around the small store three different salespeople asked if we were finding everything okay  possibly because i kept taking pictures to instagram and i didnt realize until after i left that theres a sign asking patrons not to take pictures ooops  but no one said anything and they were polite so thumbs up for the service here.
  Negative
cheap doesnt necessarily mean bad  at least not here at the stans market however you will definitely have to check double check and triple check on some occasions before you buy anything  we stop here twice a month to do our groceries  mostly for less likely perishable produce like the garlic ginger peppers baby cucumbers however we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis if you happen to buy some of the soft fruits like the strawberries blue berries or the grapes  you will most likely need to finish it up with in a day or two if not you can always freeze them to make smoothies  let me say this again this place is cheap the prices i pay for the produce here are usually  of the price i pay at giant eagle so if you know your produce  this is definitely the place to stop.

i stayed three nights here on business and really enjoyed the hotel and its staff the place felt clean uptodate and comfortable all the staff were friendly and everything was easy from checkin to checkout   the rooms have high ceilings and were nicely furnished and the rd floor courtyard even had its own bbq for guest use which seemed like a nice thought   id stay there again for sure.

ok but they do not go out of their way to help i didnt have a credit card so at first they said i couldnt check in finally they allowed me to put down cash then i went to breakfast and the shuttle refused to pick us up because roads were too bad we waited for  minutes at the restaurant no cabs could pick us up so i called the hotel and explained our situation had to get to work soon  mth pregnant woman with me only a mile and a half away he said he couldnt help we had to walk while the snow blew in our faces when we were almost there we saw the shuttle pull out with the smoking shuttle driver in it driving in the opposite direction away from us i cannot believe how rude they were.

stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about  pm  the place was empty  the bartender chris was rude and very vulger  he made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down  we decided to stay for a drink anyway  after going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock  on new years eve  the bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next  minutes  we paid for our drinks and got up and left  might be the strangest employee experience i had in awhile .

worst experience at a restaurant ever  i dont need anything fancy but this was pathetic  my coke was colored water when i sent it back she said they just changed it  came back and said we dont have coke would you like a sprite  the sprite was flat but i was afraid to order a water after that  why didnt we just leave then  the menu had quite a few spelling errors we joked about but no joke  dont go here  if i could rate this a zero i would.

my mom called me so giddy on the phone today i thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery  no  her sofa from gene sane arrived  it made her just as happy    she and i went to gene sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair  the fabric was not inexpensive  some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric some of it is not so special and i am convinced could be found elsewhere for less  however they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process  and my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there  my parents live in oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator  gene sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents building  they brought the sofa midupholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator  that is such great customer service it is ridiculous  it did fit which is great but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment  this is the kind of stuff that high end places in nyc know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case it was good to know they have the skills to do so  they were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back  these are the kinds of things that make a big difference.

this place was noted as a must visit location during my last trip to pittsburgh i must say it was definitely worth the visit   to all reading this be aware that essentially this is just a grocery store were talking about here however the rustic building and kitchy offerings like pour your own olive oilor taste our cheeses makes it kind of special   when i was given this recommendation i was told head to the back to where the cheese is so i did whoa  so much more cheese than i ever expected but no macaroni and cheeseboo   they should really consider serving mac and cheese   thats all.

unlike many historic theaters across the country the harris theater has been lovingly restored and is actually a great place to watch a movie  in a past life it showed porno movies  now it screens eclectic arthouse films and other smart selections programmed by pgh filmmakers  located on liberty street downtown the theater is easily accessible via public transportation  the concessions are cheap and the seats are comfy  what more could you ask for.

after two visits to this theater this week i want to yellp  turn up the volume or seriously look into purchasing new audio equipment easier said than done i know i felt as though i could hear every movement of audience members and the sound of crunching popcorn made me laugh out loud for some reason but the point is that i was distracted and did not at all feel immersed in the wonderful film in view.

i liked the decor of the place  when i lived in pittsburgh  years ago i was just out of college with no money and didnt care what i ate  so i spent a lot of time eating bar food pizza and  pierogies  i never knew there were fancy restaurants until i returned this week for work  i got the salad with pears  gouda which was delicious with a ton of cheese  i also had the octopus appetizer as a meal  i was surprised its much chewier than i expected  but the vinaigrette on it was tasty and the red potatoes and kalamata olives gave it a lot of flavor  the fruity sorbet was good as well    i though the service was great and the waiters didnt laugh at me for not knowing half the words on the menu  they were more than willing to explain.

the reason for this update is the service  the hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average  all solid four stars  i was a bit disappointed initially with some of the prearrangements  in the past i was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl  friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check carving station etc  now with that being said the service was over the top  stars from start to finish  i get there and am running a bit late i ask the bellboy eric how long for a shoe shine he states its pretty much an overnight service  i tell him im in a rush  he runs downstairs and shines them himself done in  minutes  while im waiting my contact for the night ryan hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine  the party goes off without a hitch great staff good food some discounted wines and good premium open bar  after the hotel party we are walking outside and run into eric bellboy again ask for directions to other club instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club  one of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store  he ran down and bought them for her and brought them back  btw did i mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock  the next morning i get a ring around  am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior  everything about this place is three to four stars  my main pet peeves are the valet cost  and  overnight  there lack of flexibility in foodbev minimums but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service  you cant go wrong in pittsburgh for an event at this spot.

staying in this hotel changed my entire view on the city of pittsburgh  the hotel is in an extremely vibrant area and i am not embarrassed to admit that pittsburgh is pretty damn cool  the rooms in this hotel are clean and the staff is fantastic  if youre driving parking is conveniently located across the street though the parking garage should come with a set of directions on exactly where to pay when you leave the building or maybe im just more obtuse than the average parker    the hotel restaurant has pretty good food and the bar is a great place to hang out and have some snacks the housemade chips are addictive and enjoy a nice drink  and if you have the great pleasure of having sam as your bartender youre definitely guaranteed good conversation and a few laughs  just make sure you bring up justin biebershe really loves that little fella.

my husband and i decided to spend an overnight in downtown pittsburgh last minute we already had dinner reservations and show tickets we just had to find a hotel room the renaissance hotel is literally next door to the byham theatre where we had show tickets i walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer it was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor i came in just as the ceremony was finishing and when they were pronounced husband and wife those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple the hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed but still service incoming guests   check in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while i checked into the hotel i was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late i really liked the makeup mirror since i have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup  we had dinner and enjoyed our show we got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink we got there at pm and waited and waited at  a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table we asked to see a menu but was informed that the kitchen had closed at pm we finished the drinks we had ordered but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night the bartender was a gentleman as i had two bills stuck together when i paid him and he found us outside to return the other one we had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat  other than the snafu in the bar all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional the room was very clean and comfortable as the need comes up i will probably choose this hotel when i need to stay downtown again it is so close to pnc park across the clemente bridge and it is in the heart of the cultural district so all the theaters are very close by it is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.

my boyfriend and i stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the north shore area which was a short car ride away we got a very good rate on hotwireotherwise i dont think we would have been able to stay here although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms including the bathroom i was sitting up in bed reading and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake  parking was also expensive we needed to use the car several times during our stay so we had to valet park which was over day plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car  the coffee shop attached to the hotel is just ok the breakfastlunch place was not very good you will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food other than the hotel restaurant which i cant comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices  one perkthe hotel does offer free internet but it is a low bandwidth version we didnt need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed so we used the free version it gets the job done for email and web browsing but it does not stream videos well  the bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good i agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as i have seen in other westinsno bathrobe room service menu not as good staff not quite as helpful also because it is a green hotel they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries if you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies be sure to request that we came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a halffull bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used not sure if they had just gotten that from someone elses room gross or it had just spilled and they didnt want to waste it they also failed to replace our inroom coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more  all in all we definitely would not pay full price to stay here but might consider it again if there was another great deal.

really poor service and way overpriced you could make much better choicesthey do not keep to a high standard of service the rooms are not worth the money.
  Very negative
i had great expectations that were sadly not met for the price of the room i was expecting a lot more for my buck maybe i was just too optimistic i will say the whole hotel was clean and didnt have any unsanitary conditions but it just seemed outdate for the top price paid it could use a spruce up our room was ready before posted checkin time and when we got to the room there were no problems the wifi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good i would say this is an average hotel for amenities with a high price tag  usually when you pay top tier rates i usually expect the service staff to be very friendly didnt get that here i think i had one of the service staff actually talk to me unsolicited i would not revisit the westin convention center  my wife would probably give it  star just for the shower head it was pretty amazing but when that is the highlight i dont think there is value here.
  Negative
ive always loved this hotel lovely location right by the river near enough to the sports venues for a pretty easy walk over the bridges  check in was pleasant as ive always experienced here staff were all very friendly and helpful  rooms were clean but could use a bit of updatin.
  Positive
a friendly place with great seafood  it is cash only the clam chowder was meaty and creamy  the onion rings were crispy and so was the fish a nice place to see local flair.
  Positive
this place is defiantly a historic site from the floor to the table tops to the bathrooms i love learning about the history of how places came about mary the bartender gave me lots of infooldest bar st one to let women in same flooring etc   the food is frozen so if youre looking for fresh seafood this aint it i had one of their famous oysters  very good i highly recommend getting only  very filling i had the special crab cakes   sides imitation crab  lots of filling so i dont need to tell you how nasty that was my house made chips were good  cole slaw had very little flavor   i did noticeafter i orderedeveryone was getting the fish sandwich so i was like dang i shouldve ordered that my return is questionable if i go back its only going be for the fish sandwich  oysters.

a friend of mine and i thought we would meet for lunch one wednesday im a fan of thai food so i thought we would give the lemon grass cafe a try we arrived a little before noon and were seated promptly that was the best part of the experience it took an hour to receive our food an hour on a busy wednesday lunch break there was no sorry were working on it  etc no explanation at all was given the food was meh ive had much better i would not recommend this place to anyone   as we were walking out a lady was waiting for her takeout order which she called ahead about and it wasnt ready yet and she had been waiting over  minutes for it terrible terrible customer service.
  Negative
wow im surprised no one has left a review for this place yet ive been here quite a number of times and ive never been disappointed service is good and the food is wonderful this is the closest thing to getting chinese food from dc  you definitely have to get the general tsos chicken i drove all the way to get some food from here during last years horrible winter storm when you have a craving you have a craving.
  Negative
great spot for weird or obscure parts general maintenance items and to  borrow a wrench or two  gerry is like a wise eccentric uncle   i remember going there for my first time in the early s and it hasnt changed in almost  years.
  Positive
great pizza from the graziano family   great subs tasty sauces nice crust lots o beer  no complaints whatsoever.
  Neutral
the last  or so times ive visited theyve been closed  minutes early  on the plus side ive discovered i look damn good with longer hair.
  Positive
i dont care for the lunch buffet because of its limited options mostly potatoes and beans for vegetarians sometimes some previously frozen veggie medleys and lack of spice for understandable reasons but for dinner especially take out i give peoples  stars   i usually get either baingan bartha or aloo gobi as well as a dal and a plain naan the dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two ive tried to stop letting that perplex me but i can never remember the one they dont have and often try to order it maybe my take out menu is outdated in that i should cross that one out ok now on to important stuffi order a spice level of  out of  the results are dynamite instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil i can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice they also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes each bite is a mouth explosion and i love mouth explosions   this restaurant has its shortcomings but since its the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure i am a big fan.
  Very negative
i am in town for work and i decided to order food from here the food was awesome i ordered the peoples special biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room i will definitely order from here again the next time im in town.
  Positive
first of all a disclaimer the only thing i have ever ordered here is the pho tai i spent a semester in vietnam eating pho on an almostdaily basis and now it is my comfort food what i want when i am sick tired or sad that said i can recommend the pho tai without hesitation out of the  vietnamese restaurants i have been to in pittsburgh this vietnams pho and my ngoc this has the best pho the broth is quite goo.
  Negative
if there were an option to give an extra star for a special experience i would surely do so for golden razor i must confess that i have a really thick beard and my stubble would surely light a match well but it did meet its match out here the shave out here gives me a sense of hope against the injustice of my beard also i have been lucky to taste some home made lemoncello from the house of the master himself.
  Negative
i just moved to the area and went here for the first time the other day tomaso did a great job i high recommend this place.
  Positive
if you were to base  cees as a restaurant it definitely will get one star   however this place is known as a grease spoon dive  that is exactly what it is and by far the very best dive diner that i have ever been too           jeanie is great  she will be your greeter your hostess your waitresses your personal cook your bus person and your cashier  whew  jeanie is not a jeannie in a bottle she cannot snap her fingers so that your meal magically will appear in front of you  she is the only person that i have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food   her cooking area is quite small  trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it   jeanie does swear like a sailor but in a quiet mild manner and not like a raging lunatic  when you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth    trust me i  hate it with a passion when people swear but with jeanie it is okay   but with jeanie you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force  however while jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and sweet heart  she will make your order the way you want it  beware  the portions are huge   the coffee is endless the prices are very reasonable    so why only four stars when it should really be a five  well as i mention jeanies swearing like a sailor is part of the  cees experience  i can deal with hearing damn mf shit  etc  i cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words  when people say jesus christ name or god followed by the d word i get upset.
  Negative
tram has great pho and enough of it to feed all of pittsburgh when the next fake armageddon rolls around.
  Positive
i only had pho so i cant judge the rest of the food but the pho was the worst ive ever had biggest let down ever as i drove here once and it was closed and came back excited to get my fill of pho at whats apparently the best place in pittsburgh but  left feeling sad the broth tasted like water and amount of beef and noodles you get was pathetic.
  Negative
pittsburgh isnt a city known for its culinary prowess but there are little gems around town that i can always find myself going back to its not about amazing food its not about cheap food its about good value and thats what trams is their spring rolls might not be something to write home about but the coconut vermicelli is great and something you are seldom to find elsewhere in fact i havent ever had that anywhere else in my american dining experiences vietnamese coffee is like intense dessert here and a nice sugarycaffeinated pick me up thats not unwelcomed go to trams get some noodles nat.
  Negative
tessaros has a full menu but if you go there you need no you must order a burger   they have the very best restaurant burgers i have ever eaten   not greasy great taste and they grill them right there in the bar  dont miss out on the best burger of your life.
  Negative
in theory tessaros is exactly what you want  a casual neighborhood joint in a great location with an acclaimed product in practice its not very pleasant to go there i dont think they want us there every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward  the burger itself   the actual cooked meat  is indeed good but they have no interest in all the other stuff that turns cooked meat into a hamburger experience  the buns are poor qualit.
  Negative
loved this place  wasnt sure what to expect  my cousin told me that they had the best burger in pittsburgh  well ria you were right   done to perfection exactly the way i asked for it  not only was the burger great the potato salad with came with it was just wonderful  i think  tessaros will be on our list of go to places from now on.
  Positive
i just dont understand the appeal  ive tried this place twice thinking that i somehow had a lemon of a burger the first time  and then returned a few months later  nope  the smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh but where the hell is the flavor  i can go as far as saying that i dont believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper  if i closed my eyes it is possible that i wouldnt even know that it was a hamburger  that is embarrassing  maybe if youre used to eating  cent burgers sysco meat or at chain restaurants then you would find this to be amazing  ive had some of the best burgers at many cities in the us and this is an embarrassment to pittsburgh  go to brgr if you want a tasty burger near bloomfield  on the other end of the spectrum were the sides the sides were classics but definitely above average especially the home fries  i would consider a  star rating if it werent for them  additionally the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend the decor is old school and seems satisfied in its current state  just like the food itself  file this one under legacy restaurant still living on its past accolades.
  Very negative
tessaros i kept hearing was the best burger joint in the burgh the award in my opinion is still up in the air i have quite a few more places to check out  a huge plus to tessaros for their kitchen wow is that thing small and the two guys working were rolling the burger patties right through the window ahhh mazing i also heard tessaros butchers their own meat on site i love hearing this   tessaros is definitely worth checking out the lunch crowd gets a bit tight as their tables are close perhaps try a bit before or after the average lunch hour oh and they arent open on sundays so steer clear of that day.
  Positive
a ton of people told me to try this place so i went  its very different than most restaurants the place is old school but so friendly my pal and i had a great time we got burgers of course we are used to bold flavors and crazy combination.
  Negative
i have really good food here in the past try eggplant rolatini and the local bread is fantastic tonight however was just awful linguini alfredo was supposed to be homemade but it was a far cry from the simple buttercreamparmesan classic recipe it was way too thick and absolutely tasteless also my diet coke tasted funny and lack carbonation my nephew ordered a grilled cheese and i thought they would use the local sancholi bread but no.
  Negative
free wing fridays oh yeah  i dont even like wings usually but silkys knows how to cook em so they dont taste fatty  get a side of atomic sauce which is flavorful as well as hot  id buy it by the bottle if i could  the menu is huge and everything ive had has been good  i always get the home fries on the side which are cooked with onions and fried jalapenos   great waitresses too  would be five stars if it had decent air conditioningin the summer sitting inside is painful.
  Negative
comfortable friendly affordable  nice stop before an evening out  i need to head there primetime to assess the evening vibe  will be back.
  Positive
this place is the real stuff just moved from portland or and its the only place that reminds me of home great food great drinks and great peeps if you really wont to experience bloomfield to its fullest two wordssunday funday check it out and you wont be disappointed  gopitt.
  Neutral
the waitresses are salty the food is mediocre at best the place is a total dump  however its open late and the cook with the mustache is rad  also you meet the funniest people ever there.
  Negative
disappointing  the food was below average and the service was ok  we were expecting a lot from this restaurant but it definitely did not deliver  pasta was not homemade and sauces mediocre at best  wine selection is very weak  the outdoor seating is a redeeming quality.
  Negative
i havent found thai food that blew me away in pittsburgh but the waiter here was incredibly friendly and my mock duck dish was solidly tasty.
  Negative
i surmised two things from my visit to thai cuisine  a the competition among thai restaurants must not be very stiff in this town  b yinzers wouldnt know good thai food if it flew into their open mouths  this place was horrible my fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what youd find at a church fishfry insipid overbattered and generally unpleasant my dining partners masaman curry was so sickly sweet it tasted like melted coconut ice cream surprisingly the joint was slammed   on the bright side service was very fast on the downside our waitress was definitely stressed out and cranky possibly from waiting on the top of inebriated coeds across the room from us  the takeaway if youre from pittsburgh youll probably love this place  it was packed with your kinsmen when i was there but if youve enjoyed quality thai food in any large coastal metropolis steer clear  ps food was needlessly pricey given the poor quality.
  Negative
a year later prices have increased  and the quality of food have declined customer service is still superb though today i ordered a padseeyew with beef level   was made in an old pan with burnt scraps  beef in dish only there were clumps of chili not blended in the dish and was drenched in oil another dish red curry with chicken was always lacking chicken pieces theyve increased prices and cut back on portions and quality which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad sad to say this used to be my favorite place but now we will never return and we are currently looking for another thai place to be our goto.
  Negative
if you get nothing else here get the tom kha soup it is seriously the best ive ever had anywhere im not trying to be hyperbolic but this tom kha soup is the standard for which i compare all other tom kha soups ive yet to find its match it is truly delicious i usually get the veggie variation loaded up with silky smooth tofu and tons of veggies but any variation is just as wonderful   i just returned home from a trip to thai cuisine with some friends the environment is comforting and warm i love the lights strewn along the windows they just add to the coziness of the place after getting the obligatory veggie tom kha soup i got the green curry with shrimp others in my party got the yellow curry and the panang curry and everyone was pleased with their choices the green curry was a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies were nice and crisp  they were featuring their mango and sticky rice dessert i had a bite of my friends and i was sad that i was too full to have a dessert of my own   as we rolled out of our booth totally stuffed and satisfied we all proclaimed that this was the best decision we could have made with our night definitely one of the best thai restaurants in the city.
  Positive
this place never fails curry is amazing i always get the red bean curry the service is always fast and courteous perfect to sit in and done or togo its byob so feel free to bring a beer or wine bottle.
  Negative
cute place i went here after a kickball game with some of my team members  the staff were fantastic  i called to make a reservation and they were very nice  they also called back to make sure it was ok for us to sit in the bar    upon arrival the bartender was very pleasant  she showed me to the table which was marked reserved    she took drink orders then food orders  my guests said the food was good but i didnt have anything  there are tvs all around the bar and some games to play as well  this is a little gem in the south hills.
  Negative
went to getaway last night for famous fajitas not so famous anymore waitress brought steaming hot plate after very long wait she forgot the taco shells when she finally got back  she brought pita bread instead i corrected her she appologized and fixed it the cooked meat was bland  no seasoning like they used to havewifes steak was overbooked and drywere looking for a new place now.
  Very negative
i really dont understand the hype of this place to be honest had the personal recommendations from friends not made this place seem like the biggest deal in the city then i would have probably rated it a  or  the pizza was just ok it was decently greasy and the crust wasnt all that special they wouldnt deliver even though i am literally a few blocks from them and they dont accept credit  debit card  a huge downfall for me.
  Negative
i have tasted the best pizza in the us pepes new haven ct and i have tasted a whole bunch of bad pizza and a whole bunch in the middle  i am coming to the conclusion that pizza is a very personal thing to people who love it like i do  after years of people telling me to go here we finally stopped on our way home from my sons hockey game at noon on saturday  service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do  no one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order  but after we figured it out everything was good  we ordered a large pie  cheese and  cheese and sausage  the crust is very good and some of the best tasting i have had in some time  it actually had a taste to it not just a bread taste  after that everything else is what i consider the personal taste part  the sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me  i dont know if they used provolone i should have asked but it gave the pizza a funny taste to me  i wont be going back just because my personal taste.
  Negative
this is an oldschool pizza shop  im sure that many of the foodietypes who frequent yelp are going to dismiss this place but having heard so much about it from my local pizzaloving friends about the pie at fioris i finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while i was in the neighborhood  the sauce definitely isnt for everyone  its a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to  but the sauce is interesting and the crust is perfect  a little too much flour used when it was flown but im guessing thats because the place was doing such a high volume of business  the pepperoni reminds me of the old mineos pizza small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools  wow now thats the pepperoni i love and definitely not the pepperoni youll find at papa johns or vocellis or dominos or little caesars or pizza hut  this is the pizza of your youth  the pizza you remember your dad bringing home complete with the relicstyle pizza box  its not in my neighborhood and im lucky enough to live close to lucianos but if im hungry and in the vicinity of fiores any time soon i wont hesitate to grab a couple more pies  maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast.
