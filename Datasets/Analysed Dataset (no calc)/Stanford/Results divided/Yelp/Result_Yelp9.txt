this hooters is near my house so its always convienient to come here but the service and the food is hit or miss  i frequent a lot and really enjoy their wings the server was mia all night twice i had ordered wings one flavorhoney thai and i got the new flavor they have chipotle honey both times was not satisfied at all server took my drink for refill and never came back after  minutes i asked for the check she sure was quick to come get that  the manager there is rude and unattentive she accused my friend of making a coupon that was on their website and did not want to accept it because she said she didnt know where the coupon came from even though we pulled up the website and showed her the coupon   the one that i really enjoy is the one on alma school it is a bit of a drive but the food and service is always spot on.

i dont know what happen to hooters my roommate in college use to work for one in houston so i have frequent hooters a time or hundred in my life the quality of the product has no integrity it is so nasty the wings are never fried correctly they come out bloody and under sauced i just want some wings once in a while with breading  iit is difficult to find.

this should have been a better experience   ill begin with the food  we arrived on a sunday afternoon after a visit to the phoenix art museum  we ordered a blt salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish  we also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck  the salad was good and was accompanied by fresh hot bread  the minestrone soup was outstanding  the salad and soup were brought out early as we requested and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived  the manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some   so far a good dining experience  then the bill arrives  the salad was  and then entree was full price  we questioned the bill as the lunch menu said the salad would be  and the entree  off  the server actually apologizes and says hell have the manager correct the mistake  then he comes back and tells us sorry manager says lunch prices only apply monfri  nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies monday through friday and we were never told  i didnt press the issue paid the bill and off we go    what could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham  giving patrons a menu with lunch specials and prices and then waiting to mention that doesnt apply until the bill arrives disgraceful  deceptive business practices will trump decent food every time hence the twostars.

ok this place was soo fantastic i ordered the appetizer sicilian garlic cheese bread it had the perfect amount of cheese and garlic the bread wasnt hard either just right for my main entree i went with chicken broccoli fettuccine alfredo i definitely made the right choice it tasted delicious to top it off they include dessert with dinner .

my family of  went for dinner on a saturday night we had a reservation for  granted we went early to see if we could be seated earlier but no luck needless to say we did not get seated till almost  the hostess staff was rude and had to get the manager involved my kids did not like to food at all and they love spaghetti and meatballs food did not come out hot at all the food was also average nothing special about it i would not recommend this place and will not be coming back.

used a groupon special for the murder mystery evening with tickets to the show and dinner the murder mystery show was in a room about  x  feet with  people crowded into this space the volume of the music and announcements were so loud we couldnt even talk to half the people at out table they took our drink order and we didnt see it until half an hour later the food was horrible how can you ruin a spaghetti dinnerfirst of all it was cold cold spaghetti  hardly any sauce the house salad was taken out of a plastic bag and dumped into a bowlat an italian place they served the salad with only ranch dressing  not even italian and no choices offered  our party of four will not go back at least  others felt the same way.

close to work yet i think i will keep walking  ive been there for breakfast and lunch and its ok  i tried their spicy peanut slaw and all you can taste is sriracha and nothing else bleh  i couldnt eat it it was not flavorful just a burning heat sandwiches are ok nothing to really jump and down about.
  Negative
i wish this place were better the only redeeming factor about this place is the happy hour i went here yesterday just after the lunch hour and the service and food were both below average dont get me wrong the hostesses were nice when they were actually around  i had the veggie burger and my friend had the beef brisket with bourbon sauce generally i find that if the veggie burger is good the normal is bad and vise versa however both were terrible my veggie burger had a terrible mush consistency and the quality of the bun was awful my friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless   for the price i would expect better food much better food   honestly they should get rid of the tables and add more beer taps quit the food up the drinks.

i have to say i was extremely disappointed when stopping in for lunch today  my husband raved about toms lunch he had several months ago  he said they had killer potato salad and a chilimacandcheese youd never find anywhere  the  of us ordere.

this has been my car wash since i lived in midtown off rd street and thomas they do a great job and are very accommodating if they miss a spot they tend to be somewhat expensive but then again they are not scratching your car with machines i used to get the side wash with my audi because of some modifactions that kept it from being on the rails and for  you couldnt get a better wash in town   i dont recommend their detail service as they are not very complete but for car washes a.
  Negative
i had really high hopes and i was thrilled that its so close to my house however i soon started second guessing myself after pulling up i was there before anyone else and watched the attendant avoid my car and instead go to the  old guys in expensive sport cars that showed up  or so minutes after me and she even waited a little longer after that like she was hoping another car would pull up when one didnt she finally came to my car and her attitude sucked on top of it its not like i own a nasty beat up car either its a newer mitsubishi after telling her i wanted a full interior detail and an exterior wash i went inside and sat around for a few hours when it was finally done i got what i expected a nice shiny clean car with a soaking wet interior granted ive never had an interior detail before but i didnt expect everything to be sopping wet regardless of that they actually put down a plastic cover over my seat for me but since i had to stop at some place afterwards i accidently ripped it and then had to ride around with a wet bottom i was told to keep the windows cracked an inch or  and did the whole weekend however now my car kinda stinks and im going to be pissed if theres mold or mildew factoring into that im not happy and im not going back either im giving them  stars because they did what i asked them to do they cleaned my car  ps i work at an insurance company i spoke to an appraiser and found out that places should really be doing a dry shampoo to avoid screwing up the foam bits they have under your carpets and inside your seat.

this place is way overrated they let ur car sit for  minutes before they even start to dry it  by this time the water spots are already dry and they miss spots in the front or sides all the time  their armor all has gone down as well  they used to have the best tire gloss that would last for  days now they use a cheaper brand thats dull  this place has really gone down over the years  again way overrated   second vacuum pfffff.

i dont know how this place stays in business the menu is so limited would you like chicken or chicken chicken in a pita chicken on some lettuce chicken rolled in a tortilla and the pita chips are bland yuck and  the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy ive only been twice and tried different dishes both times but i just dont get anything greek about this place.

hard rock cafe is a cool place to go if youre in the area and want to kill time before a concert or a game but destination bar its not the food is average and the drinks arent anything out of the ordinary infact theres nothing really unique about the hard rock aside from the fact that they jacked up the prices because youre dining andor drinking at the hard rock cafe   im disappointed that it doesnt compare to others around the world and seems out of place in phoenix a hard rock scottsdale would be way cooler.

long lines beforeafter sporting events limited beer selection mediocre food i wasnt impressed i cant tell you how many times i thought it would be a good idea to stop in for a drink or snack while in the area only to find out that a baseball or basketball game was scheduled down the street and the wait would be an hour or longer not worth the wait.

ive been to this mcdonalds twice one month apart and ive had the same experience twice  the hash browns are gross they taste like theyve been fried in old burned rotted oil this is the only mcdonalds ive ever been to thats had foul tasting hash browns  both times ive sat inside and both times ive overheard the same bitching several times over the manager having to continually tell a male employee not kidding around stop being mean to the customers and be nice.

i enjoyed the arizona ultimate womens expo  it was something that of course was geared towards women but i saw several men there as well  i must have entered at least  drawings  deidre hall was great  its an even better time if you can get a few girlfriends to go with you  there were  different stations for alcohol samples  some of them were good some not so much like the senorita limonita  that was horrible  if anyone plans on going in the future plan ahead  i totally didnt even think about the diamondbacks playing  i had to drive a little bit further for parking which was worth it  it only cost me  whereas every other lot or garage i saw was  or   also take your time when walking through the expo  theres so much to see and do  find out when the keynote speakers go on and when demos are so that you can get the most out of it.

one of my favorite veggie sandwiches ever  the sandwich is called wheres the beef and any menu planner  company owner with a sense of humor is aok in my book  comes with tomatoes celery sprouts lettuce avocados cucumbers jicama and pinenuts  i recommend adding spicy mustard and havarti cheese  great place for a downtown lunch  there are lots of places that do sadwiches  i go to jacquees for good boars head meat i go to sticklers for the delicious fresh bread and i go to dd for the unique hot and signature sandwiches on their menu  soups change daily as does a flavored tea staff is hit or miss on friendliness  today i got to try the buffalo chicken soup and was impressed then again how can you go wrong with a creamy chicken soup with that tangy spicy buffalo flavor the good news i could probably eat  bowls the bad news i could probably eat  bowls calorie counters  stay away from this soup  dd can get very busy around noon along with many of the downtown places  i suggest calling in your order if you dont want to wait or you can even use their website to order online  cool.

i went here a couple weeks ago and was pleased with my cheese steak i had it then with just the meat and cheese today when i returned the guy at the counter asks with onions and mushrooms okay yeah sweet or spicy peppers spicy please and what i received knocked the socks off that earlier sandwich   this place is tiny cramped a bit chaotic and is apparently cooled by wallmounted fans yet i can see myself going here on a regular basis so the next time youre having one of those moments like ameerah a opt for the cheese steak just be sure to let me know before hand so we can meet up.

this is the first time yelp reviews have let me down i tried this new location due to the reviews and being  mins from my job i opted for a manicure and shellac three days later the shellac cracked and began to peel i called the salon and they asked i return and have the shellac redone i did and the following day the shellac was cracking and peeling this has never happened to me with any shellac or other type of gels this was a waste of money and especially time.

not sure why this location has received so many bad reviews i used to work directly across the street from this location and would go here for lunch at least  times a week i still make it down there occasionally since i no longer work in phoenix the owner and his wife are always so sweet and chatty they remind me so much of my grandparents i compare all schlotzkys to this one and most fail in comparison  my favorite sandwich to this day is the albuquerque turkey with lots of their hot sauce now my mouth is watering as far as poor choice of sides go good luck finding a franchise sandwich shop that serves fries i prefer chips with my sandwich anyways anyhoo if you are in the area around lunch time be prepared for a line but it goes quick .

i cant believe i have been here for going on seven years and just tried this restaurant  the sauce is amazing and the meat is tender and delicious  the atmosphere isnt the greatest even for a bbq joint but the food was great.

im glad i had a deal chicken deal because the food was just ehhh   with my credit of  and a few extra dollars i ordered a full rack of pork ribs which included two sides i chose collared greens  sweet potato fries small upcharge that i was not informed of lb of hot links and a few free dinner buns   the ribs were fairly good  stars albeit a bit dry i guess thats why they drown it in bbq sauce the hot links however were dissssgusting  stars just thinking about it makes me want to puke it was so soft i quickly tossed out the serving that was on my plate and what was left in the container they are what i imagine vienna sausages would taste like but spicy of course   collared greens  sweet potato fries were edible not cringeworthy like the hot links but not worth the caloriesstomach space either   service was friendly  efficient   warning be prepared to swat flies if you dine in there were several on the day i was in ick.
  Negative
service i asked the clerk what would be a good meal for a family of four he gave his recommendation and i went with it got the meal home and we only have  mac and cheese  potato salad  rolls now this wasnt some big styrofoam container it was just enough for one person the clerk seemed like it was a pain for him to answer some questions about the food that is keeping him employed   food it was ok not great just okay there wasnt anything that screamed have seconds the sauce is decent nothing spectacular   overall it was a  because nothing blew me away i just made some ribs tonight on the grill and i thought they were better than honeys  if youre craving bbq then this will get you out of a pinch but if you want the slap yo momma type grub then make an about face.

went there with my girlfriend for what i thought would be good bbq she ordered the half chicken and i got a pulled pork sandwich  not only did her chicken come out pink and bleeding once but it happened twice when i told them the first time the cashier said we usually have good food so its okay to serve bad food too he asked how the chicken was when he was bringing in the chairs from outside and we said the same  still pink and bleeding all he said was oh okay and walked away i didnt even eat my sandwich because if they couldnt cook chicken right why should i trust them to cook the pork correctly when i went to the front to talk with them they all disappeared  never would i think about going back and spend my money there again.
  Negative
have not been there in a long timethe guy taking the order was in some other world the amount of pork or chicken on the sandwich has been reduced to almost half the drinks are watered down and the prices are up me thinks i wont be back there.
  Negative
first time here  ill give credit where its due they have apparently been reading the reviews because the staff made an extra effort to be friendly and courteous   i had  bbq beef sandwiches because they were out of the pulled pork  while eating my sandwiches i had the thought there should be laws enacted to constitute what restaurants can call bbq  boiled meat covered in bbq sauce is not bbq   i grew up in the south ive been to memphis in may a couple of times so my standards for bbq are admittedly higher than average but this was not even close to real bbq  was it decent food  sure  decent at best  was it the reason i got an upset stomach a couple hours later possibly   i dont care about the old decor dirty looking bathrooms or anything else if the food was good i would go back  it wasnt.

as you might be able to tell from my schizophrenicly changing stars for this place my experiences have varied  some things that do not ever change with my latest experience in parentheses they seem to carry only the tastiest wines  pascual toso reserve malbec  their cheeses are also amazingly amazing  american plate w buzzed from utah and a perfectly aged gouda their food is great  lasagna  however the kitchen ran out of pizza maccheese which is what i wanted and lasagna luckily i made the cut  thats easily half their menu  we subsequently had to change our orders twice as the bad news kept rolling in  by the end of the night our poor server was like the angel of death since each time i saw him i got nervous that he was going to come tell me that whatever it was i had ordered was yet again ed then the food that we were able to order took over  minutes to show up then the reverse happy hour cocktails were inconsistent different colored pomegranate margaritas one pineapple cosmo that tasted great but a nd that had a coffee flavor  which they gladly replaced for a good tasting one  overall i ended up paying way too much for a lackluster experience  what really peeved me off was that i had recommended this place to our party of  with the hope that i could show them how awesome places in cenpho are since theyre all suburbanites  so thank you cheuvront for making me look like a fool and giving my friends one more reason to stay in the burbs  .

decided to take a short trip downtown to try the central coast wine tasting event held here last week  we had a blast  while the rep that hosted the wine tasting made the wine tasting a fun and informative event we really enjoyed the atmosphere and food   the tapas plate that came with the wine tasting was fabulous blue cheese and bacon stuffed dates a super tasty california cheese bought some to take home and a tiny but very yummy shrimp salad that only made us want to try more    jeannie loves scallops so naturally she ordered the scallop martini  i know deep down she did not want to share but she graciously fed me one of those monsters  she said they are the best she has ever had and i have a hard time arguing with her  three big tender perfectly cooked and seasoned scallops resting in a martini glass  the accompanying sauce was absolutely delicious  we also ordered a single cheese plate with a cheese from spain mahon i think  loved that one too so of course we bought some to enjoy later   wont wait for a wine tasting to make our return.

alice cooperstown is as my husband said like a hard rock thats not stupid  the concept is a bizarre combo of alice cooper and a sports bar  and it works    we stopped by two other places to check out their menus before a game and they didnt look very thrilling  the menu at cooperstown is pretty extensive  lots of options    the service was very quick and efficient  i see no reason to go anywhere else before a dbacks game.

lets just say this place is awesome my sister in law ordered that huge ol hot dog and shared it with  different people i had a bbq chicken salad and it was pretty good and a very decent size i wanted to take the cup home that they served our drinks it  it is a fun place to work out and if your kids are scared of dark make up i would definitely steer clear of this place but fun place to just enjoy a good lunchdrink or two.

ive driven past this place many times on the way to suns or dbacks games  every time i passed by it looked like a fun place to go hang out  i finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown phoenix  one of the companies at the conference hosted a party here  the party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant  the company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary cigars so i understand why they had it outdoors  the weather was perfect so it was a good time of the year to do it  the place was packed too  so why the  stars  heres why   they serve wine out of a liquor gunyes they do  when i went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of cabernet the bartender told me you have to go inside because we dont have the handles with the winei thought she was kidding and i said im sorry i dont think you understand i asked for a glass of cabernet  you dont have any bottles back therethats when she confirmed what i heard and said no you heard me right we serve wine out of a handleline and since were a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get itwhat the hell  the wine tasted like what you would expect wine from a tap to taste like   the restrooms are like gas station restrooms  theyre located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that theyre too small and dirty  they couldnt handle the crowd of people at the party   service is slow  the line at the bar was  people deep for each line  lines  there were only  bartenders to service  people  it took  min to get a drink   the party felt like a house party in someones backyard  plastic cups plastic furniture you had to bus your own tablethere were no buspersons or anyone to clean up  bizzaroworld  overall not a good experience  maybe if i was a young  yr old it would be coolnot now  return factor  .

we took our inlaws here while they were visiting from out of state this was on their to do list of local experiences it was also my first time here since moving to the valley nobody was disappointed    we came for lunch on a thursday around noon we were able to get metered parking right in front of the place there is a lot in back that charges  as wellthey were about  full we were seated right away and greeted by our waitress immediately they brought a highchair for the baby too    i loved the duecor classic rock and roll memorabilia was the theme many of alice coopers own items decorated the wall from tour posters to guitars there were several large screen tvs and classic rock and roll music was playing as well the waitresses were dresses in attire that also supported the theme    the menu features items with a celebrity theme i ordered the adam richmans bases loaded big unit and a local micro brew the food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time this was a  lb  loaded hotdog with a good order of fries the hot dog was an all beef hotdog on a bun loaded with sauerkraut nightmare chili onions tomatoes jalapeno peppers and shredded cheddar cheese it was more than i could hope to eat but i did do serious damage after i got a to go box we browsed the gift shop everything alice was available   this place isnt for everybody who is not into the genre we did enjoy it and will return on special occasions if you go make it a week day for lunch its probably when youll get best for service they are located near chase field so they are probably packed on game day the menu is a little pricy but worth the experience.

went here while in phx on business with a friend who lives locally  thought it would be a good place to have some dinner since i love bbq  no such luck  nothing seemed like real bbq  just over cooked and tasteless  very chain resturanty  cool memorabilia abut thats about it  they only give a small cup of bbq sauce for your meal  i dont reccommend.

cooperstown sports grill does not disappoint   cooperstown offers an incredible selection of beers good food and excellent service  the prices are reasonable and the servers are outstanding    cooperstown sports grill is big filled with large screens televisions the walls are covered in vintage guitars signed by every rock star and rare sports collectibles signed by past  present icons   the food entrees have celebrity names like the bill oreilly bbq sandwiches kurt warner corned beef  az cardinals country bbq chicken salad or my favorite the jeff  grilled chicken salad  i would put the grilled chicken salad up against anybody including durants or even arrogant butcher  so if you find yourself in downtown phoenix give cooperstown sports grill a try it does not disappoint.

watched a suns game here recently and had a blast  the arena is in the heart of downtown phoenix and is near bars and restaurants  its really easy to have a pre and postgame party  we walked to lucky strikes after the game and had a few drinks and shot some pool  overall its a good time in this arena  return factor  .

harsh to say but i hate arenas the only time i go is to see s concert show or special event as im not an arenatype sports fan last nights event was cirque du soleils michael jacksonthe immortal tour i have to say as far as arenas go the us airways center is pretty amazing  entering and exiting are easypeasy it didnt feel overly crowded and parking was plentiful in outdoor lots or the adjacent indoor multistory connected building    theres a starbucks on site which was like heaven to me    i wanted a nice hot tea to savor through the show there are other wellknown food concessions throughout the arena as well as some fairly comfortable seating areas to pass the time until the powers that be allow you to go to your seat  since we were sitting in section  first row we were in the makeshift seats the same as they put on the floor foldables with no real back support  this was probably the only negative for me as after about an hour my lower back was killing me and i still feel it this morning  but    the seats were wonderful for viewing the show  couldnt have been better    sound quality was what youd expect in an arena not built specifically for music so i didnt have high expectations   i have to say that i am very impressed by the us airways center and all the nightmare worries that i had about entering the building exiting the building finding something i wanted to drink and of course parking were something i didnt have to be anxious about at all  bravo.
  Negative
i have seen quite a few games  concerts at us airways center and now having the light rail it makes getting into and out of downtown phoenix so much easier plus with a game ticket you can ride for free up to  hours before to  hours after the event for free and the train stops are walking distance from the arena  never a bad time at us airways center.

tickets to phoenix suns games are cheaper than the large beer in a cup at the arena  tickets and  brews i used to watch this arena on tv for years when the suns were good and i was living elsewhere it seems less orange in person maybe some of the seats should be painted orange too if you know the area you will know not too pay for parking either after pm meters are free and obviously on the sunday i went no charge try parking at th and monroe street inside the arena is pretty nice i had a great view from the upper deck but cmon suns do you really need ushers kicking people out of upper level seats give somebody a tiny bit of power and see what they do with it of course im stealthy and uncatchable so no senior citizen usher is telling me where to sit anyway my team the brooklyn nets won and overall a good no hassle experience if the suns ever get good again it will be worse to attend oh yeah good entertainment also at least on this day it was the gorillas birthday and a ton of mascots were there celebrating and also the trampoline dunkers were cool and the  yearold girl who sang the anthem was top notch.

i went to this venue for the carnivores tour last month and was really pleased with my experience again this time when i went we were in a slightly different section and the lighting was way better the line of sight to the show was great and although id prefer to be closer to the stage it was a great experience awesome show great accommodations.

worst nights sleep i have ever had  not only was the mattress ridiculous stiff to where i ended up laying on the bed pillows and only got a couple hours of sleep  when i went down to the front desk at am to request a room change due to the mattress and i should really say i hobbled down due to being stiff  sore the front desk lady was unsympathetic and said that all the mattresss in the hotel are the same  she gave me no options and asked if i wanted to check out and of course offered no refund or discount  even going back up to my room to pack i encountered other guests who were complaining about the stiffness in their back from the mattress  do not go here  the breakfast location pool and fitness room nowhere near out way the amount of pain you will be in all day because of one nights stay  i wish i could give them a zero on yelp but alas i am forced to give them  star which they are undeserving of.

going in  you know your going to get typical tgif food  but the view is great  if youre a sports junky you need to eat here once  we took my grandfather a sports nut for lunch hopped off the light rail and he loved it  as we ate lunch on the patio we watched as the landscapers groomed the field  the top was open the sun was shining a breeze was blowingahhh  the service was perfect  our server was funny  took time to chat and made sure we had what we needed as soon or before we needed it.

i am from out of town and have never been to a restaurant at a ball game so i was excited to go to front row to watch the dbacks game the website gave very conflicting messages about when you could purchase the seats in front row for the game so i gave the restaurant a call over a week in advance they said i could only purchase tables the day of i called the night before the game hoping that maybe they would make an exception because i really wanted these tickets i then found out that the tickets have been available all season i asked to speak to the manager who was the rudest human being i have ever spoke to in my life after about an hour on the phone with him tears and being called a liar i decided to hang up and just call customer service i understand that the table i wanted had already been reserved i just wanted the manager lyle to try to help fix the issue he said there was nothing he could do and that everyone knows you can buy the tickets all year round what a piece of crock i cannot believe i was talked to in the way that he spoke to me and i am so thoroughly upset and aggravated at him i just read some previous reviews about him on this site and its so funny that everyone agrees with me if you dont have any issue when you go there then youll be fine but if you have even the slightest complaint that has to go through lyle dont expect to leave happy.

my friend and i decided to try out tgi fridays for a beer during the baseball game to get a bigger bang for our buck for what we would pay for a small hot dog and  oz beer we could get a great meal larger beers and great service right wrong   the restaurant was not very crowded for a game night yet we were denied a table overlooking the stadium twice the manager asked us to visit the hostess stand to get a table but they informed us there was a wait no one was in line for the restaurant   i had to get our own menus from the bar after playing lets avoid making eye contact and maybe she will go away after we ordered three sets of people were sat in the tables we were waiting for and their meals came out before our order   our waiter ended up offering us a free beer for the late arrival of our food and ended up comping our entire check but that will be my last visit front row   id rather pay  for a beer and  for a processed hot dog than to get snobbed by anyone in the service industry all i wanted was a good time after a work day from hell and to enjoy a diamondbacks game .

i live across the street and visit often could not ask for a better atmosphere with a view of the inside of chase field the customer service has always been great often times it get dinner to go and the bartenders are friendly and chat it up while i wait just the traditional fridays menu but the location makes it worth going definite place to check out when you are downtown doesnt have to be a game day.
  Negative
a great little place to see shows very small very intimate a great setting for seeing a band if a band you want to see is playing here be sure to go it doesnt get anymore up close and personal than this there is no seating or alcohol so if you dont mind standing and being sober it is well worth it the art here is some of first fridays best as far as i am concerned leagues above all the other galleries be sure to stop and see the art here if you are out then.
  Very positive
this place could be really great but unfortunately as of now it sucks  first of all ive never been to a concert venue like this with no bar  call me an alcoholic but i like my beer in hand when im nodding my head to some obscure hipster band ive never heard of  the outside is kind of cool but the inside is awful  the walls are stark white and look like those cheap walls people use to divide up apartments into more bedrooms  there were no decorations or paintings on the wall when i went even though i thought it was supposed to be some sort of gallery  maybe i went on a night that they were between showings  the space is small but if they hired a better interior designer they could have made it work  unforch it didnt  the sound system seemed cheap also  this place could be great if they just put in a bar and hired a decorator.

really good service  james at the bar made some really good recommendations the place is right next to pizzeria bianco  so while you wait for a table there come here for a drink and kick it  they also have a great wine menu if youre into that  i guess on fridays they have a live band playing inside.

stumbled across this place while working a photo shoot in the area and we ordered in  since then we havent stopped eating at athenian express   a good five miles out of the way    what attracted us  great food great prices and the owners wife was undeniable friendly  seriously one of the genuinely nicest people i have ever met   i started out with the turkey pita  delicious yet she urged me to be more creative   love it all now including the staff   there isnt a day where it isnt hussle and bussle in the place  yet the service is fast and always accurate  seriously i eat it almost every day.

summer time is supposed to be healthy time so i am trying to watch what i eat now i will always be a big guy not two fat twins on their matching motorcycles big but you know not little but i definitely am eating more appropriately however i work in an office and around  people start to doublethink their lunch choices yes the night before a breakfast bowl from jimmy dean sounds like an excellent lunch selection but all that pushing of buttons and watching your meal spin in the microwave forget i.

youll notice a huge age discrepency really young kids and then there are the adults of all ages  so i give credz to any insitution that tries to keep kids engaged in using their minds  vs getting their game on in the mall  i love science museums making a point to attend in any big city i travel to  the exhibits seem lacking even in simple terms of the magic behind the science hence probably why the feedback this place is so kids orientated.

just went to the pirate exhibit this weekend and i want to write a review because it was by far the coolest one yet  i have been to the body exhibit the titanic exhibit and others there  of course there is more to do there than just that for the kids they blow stuff up at the lab they have tons of cool little sections with things to do  it is not cheap but we got the annual pass for the exhibits this year since we did the maze and we wanted to come back for the pirate and the van gogh exhibit coming next  now back to the pirate exhibit holy cow they had a real life pirates treasure at the end that was valued at  million dollars  the have tons of real pieces of  they also recovered the bell from the original ship they found off the cost of cape cod  there was their silverware belt buckles guns cannons gold silver rope and i can go on forever  it was just super cool to hear the story and see all the real life stuff  this is not just a kid exhibit and in fact i spent much more time reading things and my kids blew right through it.

arizona science center brings science and entertainment to the young and fresh minds of the community the staff are always friendly the weekend manager manny is very knowledge and able about the asc and all the exhibits he was very helpful  i look forward to visiting again the weekends are always packed if you can make it during the weekday you will bypass the mass of patrons    r.

we love the az science center so much that we recently became members and plan to go often we love the exhibits and the fact that they change out the special exhibits often i do recommend packing a lunch as the cafe is a bit pricey but the food is good.

attended the ancient ales modern science event with several others and was very disappointed  the ancient ales that we had the privilege of tasting were fantastic but unfortunately only  or  of the breweries made it the whole  hours we spent most of our night waiting in line for the breweries whose booths were open and didnt get a chance to see much of the science center thankfully i was with good company.

i love this place and my kids love this place  we have been members for years  the best part is this membership gets us into other museums throughout the us for free or for a big discount.

good hospital trauma teams are excellent theres a reason they filmed a traumalife in the er here all the nurses on pretty much all the floors are all good quite a few gorgeous ones too just saying.
  Positive
i completely agree with chris s happy pills seriously everyone at this hospital is so nice the nurses the doctors all of the staffday and night my friend is being treated here and has been addmited for various days now and everyone agrees this hospital has really made this whole situation so much more bearable and less stressful considering   when you or a friend is going through illness or trauma the last thing you want to deal with is rude and uncaring nurses and doctors you will not experience that herethey are wonderful  the hospital itself is very nice it feels modern and clean there is even a nice healing garden you or patients can relax and get a little fresh air in the food isnt that bad considering this is a hospitali had a nice salad and sweet potato fries one day prices are like an airportexpensive but at least its not typical cafeteria food  thank you good sam for taking such good care of my friend.

colin m did a masterful job filling you in on the facts about this business so check out his review  i can only second what he said    this is a real camera shop stocked to the gills with lots of topoftheline stuff  it would be easy to be intimidated but dont let that keep you from going into this fine establishment  i have bought a few things here and they have always been very helpful and friendly  you can find better prices on the internet but no instant gratification on the internet  and who is going to help you with a problem or answer a question when you have one  who will repair or clean your camera for you  no we need to support our local shops and if it means paying a few percentage points more its worth it.

rositas place rocks it has the right amount of dive atmosphere with just excellent food the green  red sauce are both pretty hot and spicy chips are fresh and fried on premises all entrees are quite big and enough to feed two it draws interesting crowd i was there with some folks from work after a conference and so were in suits there were some families retired folks emokids and bubbas try the combination burro with enchilada sauce cant go wrong with that beer and tequila is reasonably price.
  Negative
what a find i found this place thank to my trusty yelp app i wanted some good spicy mexican food and rositas place seemed to fit the bill in all honesty i was planning to go to los dos molinos but they are closed on sundays  you park behind the restaurant and walk around the front dodging a few cars along the way walking in i loved the atmosphere it was bustling and full of life but not overwhelmingly busy we were seated at a table just past the indoor fish pondhmmm the service was prompt the chips and salsa came right out the salsaoh the salsa it is delish full of flavor and lots of heat but in a good way i ordered the chicken enchilada plate one red and one green my companion ordered the green chili tamale plate out of this world good they arrived glowing hot the plates and food were so heat hot we could not start eating for about  minutes which allowed us to enjoy the ice cold beer  once the food finally cooled to a manageable temperature it was amazing the flavors were spot on the chicken was super moist and each sauce was great the refried beans here are like crack i was so full but could not stop eating them yum  im pretty sure i have found my goto mexican spot in phoenix.

good solid mexican food  big portions and small prices  if you order a burrito or chimi get it wet i made that mistake only once.

the hours are wrong for sunday beware the food is wonderful but yelp is posting the wrong hours on sundays im here at pm and this amazing restaurant is closed i am sad.

ive been going to rositas for probably  years and mainly at lunch during the work week the tacos are great the enchilads are chessy and taste good but also a gut bomb that makes you want to take a nap unfortunately this has always been one of my go to places and would normally give it  star.

being from southern california the scene is so much fun there are several clubs to go to and any night is a great time that brings us to the phoenix scene and the cashoh wait there is no scene for the ladies not going to bash them to hard because its the only consistent place that we have yes it caters to the country music crowd but they do play spurts of other music through out the weekend eveningsthe mixed drinks could be better but the prices are reasonable.
  Negative
i walk on a sat morning at am for a retouch on my ombre hair i had it blonde already and the lady first told me to wait i did she then came back got me started put foils on which i think she wasnt going to do bec my hair was already light i show her a picture and ask her if thats how it was going to look a few times and she keep telling me yes long story short afterhrs or so she remove the foils and wash my hair put some treatment on it and left me therefor another mins i got tired of waiting for her and wash my hair and i also blow dry my own hair bec she was busy with  other ladies my hair was horrible yellow and fry so burn uneven tones of yelloworangeblack and red when all i wanted was a caramel ombre i was so mad but i still just pay her after hrs all i wanted was to go home so i had no energy for arguing i did told her i didnt like it and that it was too yellow she just said it looks pretty and continue on checking me out i do not recomment rachel or the location on th st at all i when the next day with the intention of looking for the owner so i when to the other location on th ave and camelback lorraine was awesome she immediatley address me and apologize did a color correction she fix my hair it look exactly how i wanted she was really nicecaring and ask what i wanted and not wanted she was also super fast and did my hair in about hrs or less i really recomment lorraine at the camelback location she also didnt charge me for the correction she just apologize for the incovenience and gave me a treatment to fix my brittle dry hair.

la tolteca is the most authentic mexican food it is so good and a great place to eat if you are down town check out the grocery section they have freshly made tortillas to take home delicious.
  Very positive
a phoenix native told me i had to try the mexican food while i was in town so i stopped by la tolteca and i was happy i did  i tired out a torta and a couple of sopas  the al pastor sopa was right on as was the the carne asada  my milanesa torta was a bit chewy but otherwise prepared with great fresh veggies  hit up the salsa bar for some extra flavor  enjoy.

we had to be near downtown today and when scrolling through nearby restaurants on my phone i saw this one  on google its rated  stars  here its  stars  and only a single dollar sign  so we drove over  the place looks like something you might find in mexico  no hostess  walk up to the counter order your food wait for your number to be called walk into the dining area ducking under a low arch if you over  tall where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs  seriouslyif you didnt know you were in phoenix youd swear you were in an eatery in mexico  they also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter  on to the actual food  as this was my first time here i ordered the chimi  i usually do that so i have a basis for comparison to other places  my wife had the albondigas soup  we both liked our dishes  the chimi was done perfectly  a light crunch of the shell  not overcooked not greasy  the chicken was moist and tender  and it was a pretty big chimi  i think one does need to add some pico to it because the chickens seasoning was very mild  the pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference  and the mexican rice was very nice  i wish it wasnt so far from home gilbert because id love to make this my regular spot for mexican food  i would say it blows away just about every place else ive found in the valley and is neckandneck with guerreros in tempe  i cant choose between the two at this moment  i hope to return here and will be trying something different  their menu is pretty extensive with several traditional dishes including menudo lengua and albondigas.

this has to be the most ghetto and disrespectful dive ive ever been to i usually dont play the race card but unless you are a spanish speaking latino you will not be treated well by the staff  as soon as i walked up to the counter a pregnant cashier rolled her eyes and asked dully what i wanted i couldnt pronounce the name of the combo i wanted but i blurted out the number associated with it and it had a picture she looked over her shoulder at one of her associates and said something the only words i caught were token gringo customer  they shared a giggle  they were speaking in that halfassed spanish that has a little english mixed in suffice it to say i was offended and promptly cancelled the order i have not returned since then.
  Negative
la tolteca is outstanding passing through phx and a friend and frequent visitor to az told me i need to stop here he spoke truth   get the chilaquiles get them   we also had tacos de papa and caldo de camaronesthe latter was awesome too delicious broth and packed with shrimp the salsa bar had grilled jalapeufos  habanero salsa we couldnt get enough of   ill be back to la tolteca five stars no hesitation.

geeeross  the other half and i got takeout for this place   but first a little backstory  my dads whole family worked at a chinese restaurant in philly from before i was born until the late s  my mother says she craved chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on chinese in the womb i bless her for having done so i love chinese and could eat it every daywillingly  ive tried chinese in every city and country ive ever lived or visited as i always love to see whats out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations i can usually find something good no matter how nasty or base a buffet or madetoorder  and lord knows i love takeout and a movie on the sofa  great nite rite  a few weeks ago i convinced the better half to go pick up gourmet house of hong kong if i paid and he drove deal done  i ordered on the phone  no problems its rite down the street from our house so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within  minutes  we queued up the dvd and were ready to go  the fried rice was yummy and ok  not the best ive had but not the worst either  the bbq pork app was good and i liked the dipping sauce it came with everything else was skank  id say avoid the noodles at all costs they were like nasty overcooked spaghetti in a watery flavorless sauce  even with soy sauce added they did nothing for me    im kind of sad bc the other reviews on yelp seemed pretty good  the place is not that great looking from the outside and never having been inside i cant comment on that  but i would never get takeout from here again  at least we didnt get sick  it was just blandorama which makes me sad  i even threwout the leftovers which has only ever happened  one other time with chinese takeout when i left for vacation the next day and didnt want to stink up the fridge.

mu shu was closed so we gave this place a try for takeout sundays and asian food i know im asian  currently suffering worst food poisoning in this decade the kind that tears your back up from violent heaving  dont get chicken.

so i thought reading their menu seeing it in chinese language and in the  chinese district    it could be a real find  i love dives with surprisingly good food   i was soooooo disappointed  the egg drop soup was vegetable soup and just warm  a minute after my soup was served my main course came out  it had two itemspea pods and pork  not very bbq flavor rather a funny flavor  no other veges such as water chestnuts or bamboo shoots  the minimal sauce was very bland  the rice was not fresh.

whats your opinion of an md who wears a three piece suit  when i see a doctor wearing a three piece suit the first thing that comes to my mind is why is he wearing a suit  did he wear a suit to class in med school  did he wear a suit doing rounds during residency  i know lawyers and investment bankers wear suits but doctors  i want to see my doctor in  a white coat   who wears a suit if they dont have to  am i obsessed with what people wear  not normally but when an md dresses in a suit then i cant stop wondering why  you get the picture  to me theres something not right about a doctor under the age of seventy wearing a suit  i could spend this review just commenting about workplace attire but i need to move on  dr stevens performs surgery at his surgery center  yikes   i hate doctors who have a business in addition to their practice  they see patients in the office they do surgery at their surgery center theres a conflict of interest here  is it possible that patients who may not need surgery are scheduled for a procedure to pay for all that expensive equipment  i hate incorporated doctors the gucci loafers  the conferences in new york anaheim orlando miami etc  making k  from a regular practice isnt enough  are you a doctor or a businessman   whats more important  helping the sick or your bottom line like i want a new boat that costs  and the down payment is  so i need to get  surgeries done in the next  weeks to get that payment together  if i want you to do my surgery at the mayo clinic is this possible   i want to have surgery at a hospital  because lets say something goes wrong  drastically wrong like i stop breathing  when this happens in a hospital they call code blue and every available doctor and nurse runs as fast as they can and does their best to get you breathing again  in a surgery center there may not be any other doctors and there may not even be a nurse  people die in surgery centers    when i hear surgery center i think of people getting liposuction and dying from blood loss in the recovery room because the doctor left and no trained medical staff are available   dr stevens is arrogant   i was extremely ill when i had a consultation with him i had quite a few questions to ask about my situation  dr stevens kept writing and wouldnt look me in the eye when he deigned to answer my questions  he kept looking at his notepad  damn it  stop writing lift up your head and look at me when im talking to you  while im in the middle of this it began to hit me that this was not the doctor for me  im paying for the consultation i could barely walk it was june  so it was hot outside  i was exhausted had been out of work for several weeks  was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon he said he does the procedure i need all the time  maybe that was true but he would not be doing this on me as i was walking to the garage so i could collapse in my car i was almost ready to give up  i knew i had to go home get on the internet and find a doctor that i liked   i ended up  going with  dr mark lyons a neurosurgeon at the mayo clinic.

if you are at all bashful or have issues around nudity you might want to stop reading now  this place will not be for you but for the free spirited the alwun house is the place to be this month for their erotic art festival  the exhibit kicks off with their outrageous sneak preview party tonight feb th at pm  dont expect to see stuffy art aficionados milling about with glasses of champagne do expect to see transvestites on  inch platform shoes dancing and laughing with the  glitter dusted the body painted the latex clad and the goths they create a club atmosphere in their back yard with a floor show of comics cross dressers dancers acrobats and contortionists  you cant immerse yourself in the circus atmosphere and not walk away smiling.

dr austin is an amazing physician  she is compassionate caring and thorough  she is the only physician in her office which means when she needs to provide more time to patients before you you will wait  but guess what one day that may be youyou may need that extra time  so i have never once been upset if my appointment wasnt started at the exact minute it was scheduled  she has been my primary doctor for over seven years and unless she retires she will be my primary physician for the foreseeable future  if your treatment requires more specialized treatment she knows who and where to send you  as a middle aged man i purposely chose dr austin because she is smart compassionate listens thorough and has never once said fully booked when ive asked to see her for any reason that day  if you are looking for a great doctor dr austin is it .

this might be a good way to kill time if youre near the airport the food really wasnt that great it tasted cheap and like it had been sitting there for a very long time i had the caldo  mares and it was lukewarm wayyy too salty and the shrimp were mushy it was pretty gross the carne asada tacos were mostly gristle and i couldnt really taste my enchilidas with the thick blanket of sour cream over them for  i couldve gotten much better mexican food somewhere else.
  Very negative
for this pinche gringo this place rocks  its a very festive place to both shop and dine their food offerings through their cafe or whatever they call it is endless  its a great spot to grab a cheap lunch they are usually busy so allow yourself  minutes between ordering and actually eating  their agua frescos are delicious i recommend the melon its sweetened cantaloupe puree served on ice there are little melon chunkies small enough to slurp through a straw  of all the food ive had there it was good carnitas carne asada gorditas etc  so if you want to immerse yourself in good food and some lively people take a drive down to ranch market.
  Negative
i have been going to this ranch market for at least eight years here is my review the foods are not the same as they used to be we bought some tortillas and they usually last about a week but they started growing mold about three days after never used to be this way  the service we had was terrible when we went for breakfast one morning the guy at the counter was not very professional and made this face when we asked for eggs it was like he only wanted us to buy something already made  when we used to go before they were always more than willing to cook us whatever we needed on my way back to my table an employee even walked right into me with no apology  it used to be so different here.
  Negative
i have to agree with the other two star ratingthis place used to be top notchover the last  years they have gone way down in quality service and in how the food is presented i wonder if they are having trouble with thier managers hope that upper management will look into this i would like to come back and see an emprovement.
  Negative
this company is horrible they dont know the meaning of customer service if you are unlucky enough to have them assigned to you from lowes or home depot request another service provider the scheduler julie is i must say the rudest customer service person i have had the displeasure of dealing with in a long time they came out and looked at my leaking washing machine and my dryer said nothing was wrong after they tech left i found a scratch on my washing machine glass top this company is full of crack pots who need a reality check nice job julie.

maybe the current economy has forced tacos de juarez to make some cutbacks in the quality of their food because our recent experience was nowhere near as good as everyone else seems to have had we live mere blocks from here so we felt it was about time we tried it   the chips and tostada base tasted off as if the oil they were fried in was a little rancid the cheese on the cheese crisp was plentiful and pretty oily my husband called the cheese in his chile relleno the most tasteless he had ever had as was the relleno batter   i ordered a   but wanted to substitute a hard taco for the cheese enchilada i checked the a la carte prices and knew that the taco was actually less expensive so i was sure i wasnt going to be screwing them over i cant tell you how long it took me to try and explain what i wanted to our server im sure there are those who would say its my fault for not speaking spanish anyway i ended up getting my tostada and the hard taco but no taquito and no rice and beans then another  minutes of my life went by as i tried to explain again what i had ordered when the server asked if everything was alright but that really no one needed to bring me out any more food i had had enough by that point and knew it would already be a pepcid ac kind of night the cook and the server argued and finally the server understood that she had gotten my order wrong they comped my food which wasnt necessary but they insisted my taco and tostada were just alright the beans in the tostada were cold which i am not used to  weve had everything better somewhere else and feel no need to return.

a little house filled with delicious food quaint seating and a cute patio this pretty much sums of coronado cafe i have been wanting to visit coronado cafe for quite awhile now and finally today was the day this little house also reminds me of a little elfs cottage but in a really cute way   i like the food and atmosphere here i tried the veggie wrap with chicken and it had a very delicious vinegar added to it it was the perfect tough i really wanted to try the goat cheese salad but there is always next time.
