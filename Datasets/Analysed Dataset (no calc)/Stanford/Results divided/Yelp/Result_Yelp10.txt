it had been years since i had been back to ritos i was craving it for lunch and thought lets do an old school affordable lunch  i typically eat burritos at the lunch trucks so i thought ritos being in the middle of the hood nothing fancy outdoor seating and so on should be a quick affordable quick lunch for two of us  we got our two burritos after waiting almost  minutes in their lobby  the  we spent in line i know i knowwhat did i expect going there between ampmbut seriously they have all the ingredients made its just an assembly line chipotle style dang it so anyway the food took way too long and  later for one green chile regular burrito and one red enchilada style burrito with rice and beans in the hood had me complaining about my planned cheap lunch before i took my first bite   im not gonna lie the burritos are tasty and a good size other comments mentioned salty and greasy and yes that is true on both but thats why the place is famous for its simple saltygreasy food  i have had better for the same or less  and for a much better atmospherethat place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheapvintage seating a sign a mural somethinggive the place a little character and i can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned  there  anyway not my most favorable review but i think ritos has taken their fame to their head and caters to the foodiesdowntown administrative crowd vs the working class and neighborhood area peeps.

i visit phoenix frequently and this is my first stay at this location the hotel is marginal but needs some major updates the breakfast is less than mediocre and seems like they are always low on supply the last  mornings i arrived to find nothing but crumbs left for eggs lastly  the customer service rep i wont mention any names who checked me in needed additional training on how to treat loyal customers she was very rude and short during check in which i find uncommon for the brand.

at  pm we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices only one seafood entree fish tacos on the entire  pg card was less than  and that included soups i didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos    entrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas which was a nice surprise  my son had the house specialty  camerones culuchi and i tried a flashfried whitefish served whole with sides for  bucks  we agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable my fish had about  pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish thats not an attempt at humor i can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard  oz can of tuna as if they extracted most of it for their own devices leaving me with little more than skin bones and an eyeball    its hardly a crummy place on the inside  the decor is cute and colorful  service seemed friendly if a bit confused and having grown up in new england  im aware seafood can be pricey  that said after tax and tip we spent  for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch in a hole in the wall just south of roosevelt   judging from the other reviews it sounds like we just came at a bad time but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back two stars for the ceviche.

magnifico  great little place tucked away in a semiresidential area of town  felt like i was part of the family after being seated  bright cheerful atmosphere like a fiesta  food was very flavoful even the white rice  crab enchiladas full of white crab meat and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce  salsa you get red spicy and green mild with chips and i got a complimentary cerviche  the red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just the right kick of heat  cant wait to try other dishes when i return to phoenix in a couple of weeks.

i ate here  years ago and had one of the best meals not sure what changed oh wait its the quality of the fish i got the caldo de pescados the sea bass was gross so then they brought me a sea bass with ancho chiles that looked good but again the fish was no bueno im real sorry i drove  minutes out of the way to come here and had  inedible entrees   crab tostada guacamole and margarita were ok but not worth the embarrassment of not eating  different dinners the staff was super nice about it and the owner didnt charge me i wanted to pay but he refused so nice but i felt terrible bad dream.

the desert botanical gardens in phoenix az is a great way to get a sample of arizonas diverse and spectacular flora  check out the gardens in the spring when all of the plant and flowers are blooming in beautiful vibrant colors  this is a great place to take visiting relatives who love to garden or are just nature buffs   its an easy walking adventure with many cozy benches to sit and bird or nature watch  midway through the journey is a nice spot to enjoy a little refreshment and sample some yummy treats  at the end of your journey is a great gift shop with books jewelry and even plants found on the garden grounds for sale  visit when the day time temperatures are moderate and youre guaranteed to have an enjoyable time  be sure to wear sunscreen and bring a camera  dont forget to have fun.

when i want to go out but not spend  on entertainment and also get some exercise in at the same time and see some beautiful arizona landscape the desert botanical gardens is the best place i can go i enjoy walking around the garden looking at all of the flowers in bloom and all of the different kinds of cactus i also enjoy when they have different exhibits that you can see as you are wandering the garden i really enjoyed the chihuly glass artwork that was displayed a few years back   probably my favorite time of the year to come here is when they have the butterflies they are so pretty and this year there were so many of them we went this last weekend on my day off and the weather was perfect and we just had a great time i also get to brush up on my photography skills here the best because i can take some amazing pictures of flowers and butterflies   if you want to see what the arizona desert is all about you need to come here to experience it first hand its not only about dirt and cacti there are flowers galore as well.

at the dbgs for the first time ever a couple of months ago to check out the venue for my daughters wedding from the very beginning amber that young lady who worked with us was professional on the ball and organizedfar more than i can say about the wedding planner i believe she must be the parks event coordinator and totally rocked it   the place is truly beautiful so different from what a traditional garden looks like read the other reviews and the other folks will give you a much better idea of the type of plants bugs small animals or as my granddaughter loudly proclaimed  the birds with the hats   there were four other wedding going on the afternoon  but we never really heard much except for some far away music signs were clearly posted leading the way to the wedding site and the rehearsal the night before and the restrooms were exceptionally clean and pleasant to use   there was a very large room with shuttered windows and ac where my daughter and her wedding party dressed and a smaller similar room where the groom and his group readied themselves after the wedding as the chairs and such were put away the entire group came back to the same area which is a small courtyard and had a cocktail hour   my daughter and her husband were married in the far back arena where they have the outdoor concerts and therein lies the only reason this wonderful place does not get five stars   if you have your wedding at this particular site park your car in the dirt lot that is adjacent to the unloading area it is the first right as you come into the park and has a sign posted that reads service area only i understand that during the afternoon the park may want you to stroll leisurely through the park enjoying the natural beauty of the place but at the end of a very long day it wouldve been so much better to park in back and take a  min walk as opposed to an agonizing  min stroll  it was incredibly hard for some of the older folks in the group making their way back to the cars and by the time the wedding ended it was late and the only rangers we saw were on our way out   it was also very dark there and the lights on the canopy over the wedding table did not come on for a long time but eventually they did and it was truly breathtaking you may want to have someone be the on the watch for this so the wedding party doesnt eat in the dark lovely place to have a party or wedding parking not so great   thank you dbg for making my daughters wedding so very memorable.

stayed here for a long weekend for a friends wedding in mesa driving from southern california it was located conveniently near the freeway and parking was easy check in was a breeze the receptionist was very friendly he gave us two warm cookies and a map of the surrounding area to help us out looks a bit outdated from the outside but dont judge a book by the cover the rooms are definitely kept up very nicely the room was so spacious upon entering there is a couch that turns into a bed with a desk that was convenient when we ordered pizza and ate around it there is a microwave large fridge and everything was so clean the separate room was nice with a king bed that was large and comfy and had nice closet space to hang our clothes for the wedding we went to the belvedere restaurant downstairs on the first night to grab some drinks and the drinks were very overpriced but i guess thats expected for a hotel bar we loved everything about the hotel especially the complimentary breakfast located in the restaurant buffett style with a different main entree that differed everyday like french toast pancakes and waffles with sausage bacon yogurt pastries and coffee would definitely recommend staying here and will plan on returning to this hotel once baseball spring training comes around for my dodgers.

beware   i had my car serviced here before leaving the pep boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance which seemed reasonable as it was showing no signs of problems following the oil change i drove home approximately  miles where the car sat for approximately one hour i then drove from my home approximately  miles where the car engine was stopped for  minutes   shortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than  more miles the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging i immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town when examining my car the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine   photos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic.

the only reason they dont get  star is because i understand they arent accustomed to the heavier side of music and prolly panicked a bit when the bad brains came through  that said this place bites  they blocked off half the seating oversold the show and then were kicking people out for standing  it was a punk rock show following an am skate competition they were cutting people off that werent anywhere close to obliterated   the bathroom situation is chaos  the bouncers who usually work shows like barry manalow were acting like they were hells angels roughing up little kids trying to mosh and in the end pissed off the band  just to get into the place required every punk kid to remove every last bit of metal  their punk kids man  thats a lot of studs chains piercings etc what a hassle  im sure its a great place to go see celine dion acoustic or something equally lame  but why a place like that would book heavier stuff and then react like that is beyond me i felt like i was in jail only in jail the bathtub gin is cheaper and you dont get yelled at as bad for smoking too close to a doorway.

my family and i have had our phoenix zoo membership for  year now we love it it is worth every penny we go at least  time per month and always have a great time the volunteers are extremely friendly we have only met  who was not even when it is too hot in the summer to do anything outdoors we go to the zoo we play at the water park then go straight home   we watch many families parents rushing their children through the zoo to the point that the kids dont have fun with a membership we are always walking at a leisurely pace sometimes we go and only see a hand full of animals sometimes we go to ride our bikes around and dont stop at the animals at all   we love that the new kimono dragon exhibit is in and are excited to see the orangutan exhibit being started my daughter is learning quite alot at the zoo at  she is already interested in traveling the world to see these animals in their native habitat   now i must say if you have been to the san diego zoo please realize that the phoenix zoo can not compare so dont go to the phoenix zoo expecting anything more than a great zoo for education purposes but it is the nd best zoo i have been to   my family is from a small city in arizona we moved to phoenix primarily due to the culture a big city can provide for raising children i chose to live in s scottsdale specifically because the phoenix zoo is about  miles away from my home.

the phx zoo is a great place to take your kids to look at large charismatic megafauna  however if you are like me you go to the zoo to try and learn something about the natural history and ecology of the animals on display  there is very little of this the farthest that the signage goes is to tell you the continent and maybe if you are lucky the country where the animal lives the zoo is also mammal heavy dont get me wrong i love a good mammal display but i also like to see a nice collection of amphibians and reptiles  if that is what you like to see the phx zoo is not the place for you  they do have a small collection of southwestern rattlesnake and some common pet amphibians but that is it for the herps  they also have a komodo dragon that is pretty large but overall they lack the fish amphibians and reptiles  also where is the insect collections maybe i missed it  the animals do have very large enclosures but some look under kept  also there is one aviary that is very cool and has some very pretty bird species  they have red eared sliders hanging out in the ponds on the grounds that are probably the reason sliders are in natural waterways now  a shame  overall i was pretty disappointed in the phx zoo the admission was pricey and the breadth of animals small.

me and my wife have a membership to the zoo  and well  would totally recommend it to everyone  we use it all the time  heck i would go every week if she would let me  there is just something about sitting at the zoo  in the weather  with the people   enjoying the day  not all animals look happy there or comfortable for that matter but some really do look like they are oblivious that they are at the zoo  it is a huge zoo  it would take most the day to see all of it  it is so relaxing to just go for a coulpe of hours and then leave  we have been where we didnt see anyone for  minutes and on the busiest day and never felt that there were crowd problems  the zoo does does seem to do too much to just want your money  you pay a good fee to get in and then there are places everywhere to take more money from you  opportunity cost eh  my current favoirtes are the big horn sheep up in the corner  and just sitting and watching the movement at the savana  it is like my crack  some people sit by the pool and relax  i site by the savana and relax.

okso we went to the zoo this past saturday and just our luck it was the busiest day of the year so far according to one of the workers  we had a wonderful time until we got to the paddle boat area and had a horrible customer service experience with an employee named zach  we tooled around in the paddle boat for our  minute ride and upon leaving went to pick up our  deposit  as we approached the desk zach raised his voice and said you will not be receiving your deposit back because you broke the rules and let your daughter sit in an area that is off limits on the boat we had no idea what this kid was talking about  he again raised his voice and people started to starehe said you signed a contract that said she wasnt allowed to sit in the middle of the boat  you made a decision to break their rules and therefore have lost your deposit  wow  all i can say is if this is such a dire safety issue why not tell people when they get in the boat  so ridiculous and quite the scam to keep our   they even had devised a hand signal so the person at the cash register would know not to give our money to us  the most curious thing to us was why didnt they just tell us to have her move over while we were in the boat  they never mentioned it to us  it seriously ruined our trip  zach you really take your job way too seriously dude  oh and i stopped payment on my debit cardtake that.

well this has been one of my favorite courses since i moved here in  i have played this course many many times however it has a few years since i have been there and i had yet to play the new renovated course  i have used the practice range a few times since the course reopened and like the new additions so i was excited to play the course again and see the new changes  i was a little disappointed  the carts are new club cars and they are equipped with a gps featured that disables the golf cart if the driver takes the cart into an area where it should not be i can certain understand how this is a good idea however i think they have the settings a little too high  if you approach the green from the wrong side the disable feature engages  the cart paths are for the most part gone  they are still in a temporary club house from  years ago  i read in the paper that the management company that was awarded the contract to run the course is having some challenges   that is an understatement   so i guess this course will go down in my memory similar to the other phoenix landmarks that are now gone  similar to the old cine capri movie theater on th street  i would rather remember papago golf course as the great muni it was rather then the course in disrepair that it is now.

phoenix has a large but scattered population im not sure why developers picked this location for a chinese culture center  it doesnt make sense to me as the area around dobson might seem more appropriate  the center seems like itd have potential if it gave incentive for small businesses to set up shop and stay  ive heard the lunar festival held here charged admission and was dismal  its now not much more than a nearlyempty strip mall with asian architecture  i live up the street and would rather drive to mesachandler for anything asian sad because i hoped phoenix could do better.

if you have a mercedes you need to take it here being new in the area i wasnt sure who to trust i made the mistake of taking it to the dealer for an oil change and came out with a  bill seriously its oil and a filter   i tried this shop and found the owner worked at the dealership for  years before opening his own shop wow nice people and great service he fixed what i needed and recommended a few things the same things firestore mentioned when i took it there for new tires and brakes so i knew it wasnt an up sell i called around and m b motors still had the lowest price m b motors fixed my car in a timely manner and showed me everything they did   their hours are early in the day    so its convenient to drop off before work but a little difficult to pick up nothing that would effect me taking my car there who wants to work on hot cars when its  degrees out  i feel much better now that i have a place to take my benz especially being a single female and not knowing much about cars or what to do.

i have lived here my whole life  and for most of that time i have pretty much eaten gringocized mexican food  you know ajo als macayos garcias etc  at this point it is still a treat for me but i would rather eat at the authentic mexican dive with actual spanish on the menu dishes i dont recognize and very few white people in the place  el nopalito fits the bill perfectly  this place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on chowhound  it was right in my neighborhood but i never got around to trying it until last week   we showed up on a friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and sadly laying off employees  ick  we started with two cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa  both salsas were outstanding which in my experience is rare  generally if you get two salsas on the table one is terrible and one is at least decent  and mexican cokes in the cool bottles  yay  then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share  this was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy  we only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one  generous  the only room for improvement was temperature  the soup could have been hotter  next we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas andandand i forgot the name of my entree  it was however the servers recommendation and she didnt let me down  my dish was steak with bacon green peppers onions and cheese melted over the top  all of this was served over two corn tortillas  super good  everything was cooked to perfection  the green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had  the rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well  i had the leftover enchiladas today for lunch and they were awesome all over again  well be back to el nopalito often  im excited to try the  cent street tacos.

tried this place on a lazy sunday evening at the recommendation of other reviews and i would say what others have said is pretty accurate it is very authentic looks like a total dive from the outside and its in a hispanic neighborhood but the tacos here are great now just to be clear these are street style tacos they are small but they are only each which seems pretty reasonable   i ordered an adobada al pastor carnitas and a shredded beef with red chiles each were very good in their own unique ways the meat was good quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor the adobada was the standout in my mouth so much that i had to go back and order another one i also had a side of rice and beans which were good but nothing out of the ordinary   so far so good right the only slip up this place maybe has is that my girlfriend that was with me who doesnt eat meat was not overly impressed she got a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco the shrimp taco looked good and she said everything tasted alright but she was not wowed like i was about the quality of the tacos she did enjoy the beans and rice though so this place might not be the best veg friendly location but im not really going to take off for that because it is very authentic and veg friendly isnt necessarily what they are trying to do they are trying to make good traditional tacos and that they do that very well   they also serve beer here and i love the way its served your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted salted and has lime juice in the bottom speaking of bringing you the glass the service is wonderful our server was very friendly patient nice and helpful   all in all if you are looking for a good taco shop nothing fancy and authentic this might be your best bet or at least it is from the places i have been so far.

came here looking for soup dumplings after having an amazing experience in nycs chinatown i know its really not fair to compare this place with what we had in nyc but i definitely left disappointed   the service was lightening fast but there was definitely the feeling that we received different service since we werent asian for example soup dumplings are pretty impossible to eat without the small porcelain spoon but we received no utensils to eat them with at all   the eggplant was good but was saltier and more sour than i was expecting my mother said that her duck was pretty dry despite the copious amount of sauce on the plate   overall i would say good effort for phoenix but i wont be returning.

maybe im doing it wrong maybe im just taking crazy pills you can buy a bottle of  for  at costco but i hate this place   i break out in hives every time i think about having to go here so then why do i go here you may ask the same reason as everyone else the same reason listed in all of these glowing reviews to save a little bit of money  i come here for almost the same thing every time diet coke allergy meds and giant bags of frozen chicken breast those are my three goto items every few months theres the toilet paper paper towels laundry detergent blah blah blah you know the drill  why do i hate it so   pretty much for the same reason i have a deep disdain for walmart its chaos and in true walmart fashion i actually saw someone wearing their pajamas here the other day   people walk around here lulled into some kind of trance by price savings and free samples its maddening in the parking lot in the store waiting to turn into the parking lot people are crazy they completely stop paying attention to whats going on around them ive been touched inappropriately by shopping carts nearly run into by cars its insanity   oh and by the way speaking of parking lots why the hell arent there more cart return areas i think ive seen two its generally a game of can i find a spot to hide this cart or should i just walk it to the front of the store   another thing a lot of people talk about the great fuel savings ive never purchased fuel here wanna know why because every time i come here the line for fuel is no less than  cars deep per lane no thanks ill pay  cents more per gallon somewhere else   as i sit here typing anxiety level rising i wonder to myself are the savings really worth it and for now sadly the answer is yes but one day one day costco i will be free.

came here for a drug screen for a new job tried to call for  days to set up a time to come in time is money every time i tried to call the number listed the call would ring and then just disconnect so due to the fact there is a time expiration on the drug screen came in to get it done show up find out there is over an hour wait just to pee in a cup ask if there is any way i can just go because this whole procedure is going to take less the a minute to do ask to speak to a manager david who is extremely rude and proceeds to tells i can either wait or leave i explain i have been trying to call the location to set up a time were he basically tells me that there is nothing wrong with the phones he has been talking on them all day but i have been here over  minutes now and have not heard the phone ring once overall the place is dirty the wait is ridiculous especially for a basic drug screen and the staff is extremely rude i highly suggest never ever coming here i know i will never be back ever.

wownever thought there is a difference between dive bars and found out there is a big difference  this place should be categorize as a shit bar instead of a dive bar   called about  and ask about employment there and was told by some bitch working there said no we are not hiring and then with her stupid uneducated trailer trash bitch attitude ass added if you are in the business  you should know not to call during lunch   its  past lunch time rush and this bitch had to open her probably fat pimple faced mouth and give this rude comment this was so uncalled for  so i went in this shitty place to complain so glad i did not applied at this nasty ass placewhich i did not understand why anybody else did not smell or see how nasty this place really is and asked for the manager this  nasty toothless so calledwaitress said he was bartending and was busy i still spoke to this piece of shit is way too much nice of a word for this assholemanager and was treated again like a piece shit and he bitched me out saying if you are not a customer i dont have time for your shit and come back later   well the only time i would come back to this shitty bar if i ever wanted a staff infection or hepatitis from the gross bathrooms   how can anybody eat at a place where the management treats anyone this way  i would never eat here and wouldnt anyone else eat at this place.

what happened to all of the coverage on the local sports  the arcadia news used to be very supportive and involved in arcadia high school athletics  no articles and only some pictures of some of the sports these days  shouldnt a local paper support its local high school.

ive been to this applebees about five or six times over the last  years  the menu is of course classic applebees something for everyone  but i found the service to be listless  when i entered the restaurant the last time the two hostesses were sitting dow.

not only is the food overpriced and barely edible the service is horrible for the money if you really need a chain restaurant head down the road to chillis.

i normally dont prefer to eat at chains though i will on occasion but this one holds a special place for me id just driven into phoenix on a wednesday afternoon after a long drive across the country earlier in the day id signed the lease on my apartment and confirmed with the movers when they were coming the next morning   so this tired chick hopped on yelp to find some food  nearby familiar and good enough i found this applebees not too far away and also in the same parking lot as target killing two birds with one stone it was my first meal here since all of my belongings read pots pans cooking utensils were on an wheeler somewhere in the vast phoenix metropolis the people here were friendly enough and i like their  menu of dishes fewer than  calories   so while ive grown fond of finding and frequenting locallyowned joints on occasion i do hit a chain this one was there for a very tired chick who needed some hot food and a nearby target.

do not eat here terrible.

terrie really made our experience i love applebees anyway but she really treated us like we were the only table she had   we walked in at pm on a sunday the place closes at midnight we were just going to get a quick bite so they could close terrie was very friendly and honest about what i should order to get a good deal i tried the wonton tacos and they were delicious we also had spinach and artichoke dip they gave us lots of chips and terrie helped us box them up with some extra salsa   next time i am in phoenix and want applebees i will go to this location simply because of the service we received.
  Negative
this placement doesnt even deserve a star so i guess one will do the only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess after that everything else went downhill my server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food she looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust brought me a meal different from what i ordered and didnt have the guts to apologize for it the food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat place wasnt that busy so i fail to understand why it took over  min to get my food and it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me when she asked me how the food was i told her that it wasnt what i ordered and she just rolled her eyes i was tired and didnt want to start fussing with her so i just paid and left but one thing i can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when i requested for my check it came in less than  seconds this is the worst applebees experience ive ever had in my life and i dont think i ever want to go to an applebees if this is the kind of service i get over to you mr applebees ceo.

planned to have lunch  a drink alcohol wmy dad  bf  the server carded me im   she i cant take this id its vertical when i gave her my valid license i sat there till others were finished then i thought hey i have another more recent government issued id my marijuana medical license card wmy bday on it    the manager came out  told me im sorry we cant take this id either nervous chuckles we recently had a meeting on this we cant take any of these ids sorry i do believe that youre you i know ive been having the same problem cuz im  and i just had to get another license to make it horizontal   i said are u kidding me you wont give me a drink even though you said u believe these ids are me   my dad is right here    this is some bureaucratic bullshit why is applebees trying to force me to go to the dmv to get a  license renewal so it can be horizontal instead of vertical  why the hell my card doesnt expire till  whats the problem  applebees even when i do have the right direction of license card  you will not be getting any buisiness from me  i ended up drinking water.

just went to grab a quick lunch to go and must say this is the wrost prepared food to date ive gone hear at least  times before and this is the first time that i can honestly say it sucked they werent really busy since i went at  am i hope this isnt a new trend.

walking into macayos is like entering a buffet restaurant in a vegas casino tacky tacky tacky loud wall paper lots of different rooms and the people oh the people men in hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys women with big hair and lots of screaming kids staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly standard mexican fare is widely available stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy the carnitas entree is a sad clump of dry porkgee i think thats the same thing my uncle larry said of his third ex wife anyhoo the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu you have to ask for it served with a variety of blue yellow and red corn chips the dippin is fun and filling the guacamole is pretty good although it seems theres a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit i really like the mini chicken chimichangas the minis not the regular sized the latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper macayos is a family owned famous phoenix restaurant landmark the central ave location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the deelish factor my recommendation is two shots of chilled patron before the food and everything seems better hola and adios.
  Very negative
a very odd experience    we entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess  we told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what i thought was the bar area well yes but she took us out the back door of the restaurant to the back door of the bar  once there i started to get nervous  a line of  or  people waiting to get in met by two security people checking identification    once you show the security people your id they then put a wrist band on you  i am pushing  but perhaps without the wrist band someone may mistake me for under     finally inside it was a throw back to some s nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more at attention security staff    they feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted mexican food which was actually fresh and tasty  our server was nice and attentive    the entire time we were there i was worried to why they needed a security team roaming about.
  Negative
happened upon this restaurant while staying at a nearby hotel we drove by earlier in the day and were first interested in the unique architecture of the building the decor inside was fun and had an oldschool feel lots of pink and green neon lights mirrors and wall murals i loved it  went in for dinner a little late still being on west coastvacation time but there were still quite a few people and we werent rushed at all our server was very friendly and helpful when we asked about the menu even though she needed to check with the kitchen on some of our particular needs   we started with two margaritas and the espinaca con queso unfortunately it was missing spinach hmm there were some green chiles however that added to the cheese dip i ordered a beef chimichanga with their famous baja sauce oh how i love this white creamy spicy sauce maybe a spicy sour cream it was delicious hubby got steak fajitas which were good but believe it or not i was hooked on the grilled onions they were so flavorful im glad there were a lot on his platter so i could steal more than a few.
  Very negative
macayos is like chuck e cheese without the games lots of kids running around young servers navigating first jobs with little supervision and varied results often bland or lukewarm food that takes an eternity to order and arrive   at least at chuck e cheese the kids can run around and bang gophers on the head or whatever while youre waiting here you just kind of bang your own head on the table.
  Negative
yesterday we stop in for a late lunch we decide to split a couple appetizers while we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa the chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too then our food came we ordered loaded nachos  which were far from loaded i am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate the second plate was the mini chimis oh my gosh they were even worse soggy covered in sour cream and what i think was guacamole  they were inedible yuck i wouldnt recommend this place to anyone no no no.
  Negative
no no no no thats all i can say if you are planning on eating here    my daughter and i went in today on a sunday afternoon because we couldnt find another mexican restaurant that was open on sunday in central phoenix the service was fine but the food was awful the beans tasted like they came from a can rosarita brand and the salsa was just barely palatable for the same reason we each ate only half of our food before  leaving    when the waiter asked how the food was i told him and all he did was say he was sorry no offer to bring something else or comp one of our halfeaten meals   macayos on central used to have fresh food now it is just stale and tastes like it comes from a can you can definitely tell that they are cutting corners in the kitchen for the prices they charge you have a right to expect better food   i will never go there again.

its my little sisters th birthday yes i feel old considering i remember changing her diapers and i wanted to do something special for her i considered using one of the online services proflowers  flowers etc but i really wanted the wow effect of the flowers arriving all arranged and gorgeous so of course i turned to yelp and found cactus flowers   they have a great website showing photos of all their arrangements see cactus flower exclusives for prearranged local delivery options and they even offer national deliveries through ftd i found a gorgeous bouquet and even had the option of adding balloons chocolates and a teddy bear i went with the balloons because i was sending them to my sisters school and i just had to go for the best aka most embarrassing visual display possible   i placed the order yesterday hooray for nextday delivery  and even sameday delivery if you order before pm and realized today that i did not specify delivery time having the flowers arrive after shes left school for the day isnt the surprise i was going for so i sent them an email explaining the situation and asked ever so nicely that they please try to deliver before pm just over an hour later which was after noon in arizona  less than  hours before my requested delivery time  i received a response that it was taken care of how great is that   im still waiting to get a call from my sister im sure ill post an update later today to say how it turned out but right now they have a very satisfied customer   the cactus flower exclusives are gorgeous and go for  and up  tax and delivery which is    national deliveries also start at   tax and delivery     star because the bouquet arrangements most people lean towards start at about  which is kinda pricey only smaller arrangements with a handful of short stem flowers in a short vase are .
  Negative
i ordered flowers for two friends when i spoke to the designer about the size he was more then helpful with exchanging some of the flowers to create a bigger bouquet its almost two weeks later and my friend said they still look beautiful just as when they arrived both friends said they were lovely i will use them again.
  Positive
i just love going here  you can find anything you need and a whole bunch of eccentric and cool gifts that you know no one else will have    so normally i go there to browse in their extensive wine selection and end up leaving with a few bottles of dessert wine  or i grab some sake which i absolutely love and cant find anywhere else  its at this point when i hit up their deli for a delicious tuna salad sandwich  its so disgustingly good its sinful  the people that work there are so nice and helpful  all in all just a great experience.

oh ajs if you didnt exist less than  blocks from my apartment i would never go to you although you have highclass pretensions and several amicable sommeliers your employees are aware that you are a ripoff  case in point i go to ajs on st paddys day  looking for some corned beef  corned beef steak remains about  pounds price  when i lived in oregon last year i was able to get  pounds of corned beef a very cheap cut and preparation of beef for under  i mentioned the price gouging to the guy behind the meat counter and i quote hahahahahahahaha  nothing else no joke they know theyre overpriced they sell the exact same things as food city for x the price same company owns frys food city and ajs because they know that a tamale will be something the whitebread customers of ajs will consider a delicacy unavailable outside of the spanish mass at their local catholic church and worthy of more than  apiece  furthermore more whole and organic foods are sold at any one sprouts trader joes fresh and easy and whole foods than any ajs that ever existed  avoid this place unless youre a yuppie with too much money and not enough sense or unless you think one of the sommeliers is hot  stars for the awesome beer selection.
  Negative
i was across the street for a dr appointment and decided to step into the ajs after to browse since it was right there havent been into one in years for the same reason that i probably wont return after the recent visit way overpriced for things i can buy elsewhere almost everything in the store you can buy at any regular grocery store and pay less for it they do carry a small number of gourmet items on the shelves but i can find those other places too   so youd think that their deli or bakery or something would stand out but not that i can tell i was going to try something from the bakery case but it was all way overpriced and totally unimpressive looking i was there in the am so i did try a slice of the breakfast pizza that was out in the deli first off it took me several minutes to be served because the staff was busily ignoring me then when i did finally get my slice i went to pay and eat it and the thing was cold and chewy the crust was just so tough the eggs were somewhat dried out i was seriously underwhelmed   the store was practically dead the whole time i was wandering around the staff outnumbered the patrons by far how do these places stay in business you wont get more money from me ajs.

love the food quality and cleanliness the staff jimmy and austin were both friendly and helpful and customer oriented the few times ive been in though the female servers were standing around chatting about their personal things loudly and not tending to tables as quickly as they should that is what kept me from giving a five star otherwise awesome place to eat.
  Neutral
when i lived a block from pane bianco i used to make it a point to spend and eat as little as possible throughout the week just to be able to grab one of their sandwiches preferably the mozzarella tomato and basil sandwich on the weekend  a little pricey but worth every penn.
  Negative
the housemade mozzarella local tomato  basil sandwich is as good as it gets in the sandwich world.
  Positive
it takes me  minutes to drive there and it is well worth it the food is phenomenal and considering its quality the price is just right the staff is also fantastic   i am particularly fond of tom who s very energetic and engaging  pane bianco is an absolute gem and the kind of place i dont mind driving  min to get there the fact that they are right next to lux is also a plus  however i cant say the same about dinner where i had the lasagnafor   it was an abomination all there was in there was some tomato sauce bechamel and meat sauceno cheese or meat saucealtogether a huge disappointment never having dinner there again.
  Positive
really good lunch spot for takeout the restaurant is divided into takeout and dinein and the dinein portion is relatively small for large groups im a big fan of the classic mozzarella sandwich and vanilla bean rice pudding they dont have much on their menu online but the few items they do have they do really well if you order takeout make sure to call in  minutes before your pick up time so that theyll have it ready otherwise youll be waiting for your takeout   if youre going for a market sandwich i recommend calling in to get their special it can be a hit or miss i got a market sandwich without calling once and ended up with a turkey sloppy joe it had a great taste but extremely messy and oily to eat.
  Negative
the fish and chips is where its at the coleslaw is pretty much the best i have ever had the shepherds pie is excellent as well the best pub food in phoenix by far.

i like to focus on the positive so lets start there the hot wings get em spicy hot they were really good worth going here for no  its a dark bar my date liked the english vibe of it  the waitresses were slow but pleasant with bringing the drinks and once we did get them the drinks sucked i ordered a irish car bomb and got less than half a glass of warm guiness with the tiniest shot of baileyswhiskey it was almost undrinkable then i ordered the  drink shot special which tasted like a shot of koolaid  we went for the monday karaoke and the dj was good enough but there was this little tv in the corner with the lyrics displayed ive just been to better karaoke bars ie ernies  like i said my date liked this place so i guess ymmv i think i would have liked it more if the service was better and the drinks were up to par.

last night was my first visit to george and dragonand unfortunately it will probably be my last  my boyfriend my daughter and i decided to go there for fathers day  we walked in the front door and stood in the middle of the room facing the bar  there were maybe  or  occupied tablesit wasnt busy  so we stood there unsure of wether we sat ourselves or waited to be seated   servers were present as well as a blonde bartender who totally ignored us  finally we asked if we sat ourselves and the bartender said to go right ahead  we picked a booth facing the bar and sat  and satand satand sat  one male bartender seemed to be working in a back room only  another girl stood alongside the bar staring out  us drinking a soda as we sat there with no menus  the bartender who was maybe  feet from us would look  us sideways and look away  my boyfriend works for the city of phoenix  hes a huge tipper  maybe we dont look like much but we waited  minutes i am a serverbartender myself so i watch greet times closely  finally we stood up and walked outwalked right past the bartender and she never said a word  i did call a spoke to a managernamed bill who sounded shocked  i hope he took care of the problem or they will lose a lot of business   we ended up having a very nice fathers day dinner  the black forest millthumbs up to them.
  Very negative
ive been popping into the george and dragon nearly every thursday since last april for trivia nights  i like the place  the trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in but not worn down  i feel comfortable and welcome every time i visit  most weeks i end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection  the drink prices while high for some peoples tastes are comparable to what ive seen in other places  imports are going to cost more its the price you pay to have a selection of boddingtons murphys and guinness all in one place among other things  normally on trivia nights i dont end up getting food as although i find their portions proportional to the prices i dont feel i need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting  i have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions ive grabbed some eats for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended  the dragon wings are another of my favorite spicy but not overwhelming  the fish and chips as previously mentioned are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent  i recommend at least one visit to this bar  dont be scared off by the divey look of the pubfront  the fc scarves adorning the ceiling british booze advertisements on the walls and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert  if you do visit pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night  who knows you may become a regular before you know it.
  Negative
i really hate to give this place a less than stellar review because i want to like it so badly the location is great far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like youre in a more urban area big family style benches allow for friendmaking outside and individual tables inside im surprised i came back after the first time on a busier night we couldnt get service to save our lives we made sure we werent stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat staring at servers running around us for  minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead we sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so i could merely ask where the bathroom was atbut nothing i even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after  more minutes we gave up apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word that being the last straw our feelings a little hurt and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service we left half full beers and walked out upset i still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong  now we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent for mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that i usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for i dont see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that i like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friendscoworkers we still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but i cant seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth bummersville.

oh king george king of the phoenix dive bars i live so close i require no cars you have pub food of plenty  and patrons a many but consuming such grease makes me feel like a piece your beer doesnt please me and leaves me feeling slightly queasy a dungeon of darkness with lights so dim a place void of nobles and youth most patrons barely have more than a tooth my visits here leave me full of sorrow i guess see you again tomorrow.

i love this location for fed ex they were a life saver for me over the christmas holidays they are always cheerful and friendly when you come in even though when  they say hello many people do not respond rude people  any way the service is excellent it always gets there when they say it will they are super quick when they help you and they will even package it up for you  there are some really wonderful people working in the shipping dept chris being one of them a truly nice person who really wants to help you as best as he can if only more of us took pride in our job like that  great location fast service delivered when promisedwhat more could you ask for.

stopped into this shop during spring training  the staff was nice but he really pushed the kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop  we bought  of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them  the cigars didnt draw well and were generally not very good  we went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent  there the day before and only bought the kristoffs on their recommendation at  a stick  we wont be going back.
  Negative
i dont know why others had such a problem with the owner petey i went in for the first time last weekend and he was just fine perhaps its because ive learned over the years how to communicate to boutique shop owners that im not just looking but im on a hunt for the perfect fucking end tables and i hate chrome  you would be surprised how far that approach goes at any place tell the owner what you like and dont like right away letting them know you have an opinion allows them to engage with you as someone who appreciates desig.

if the stale retirement home setting and stuckinthes styled menu dont encourage you to leave before ordering waiting for the amateur service will  oh youre still here ok go ahead and order any of their socalled omelettes be sure to also ask for lots of napkins because youll be crying when you finally see the nonsense that comes out of the kitchen  the way i see it cooking omlettes is very simple you take good ingredients mix them together cook it all without burning somehow they manage to ignore all of these suggestions yes even the mixing part they apparently manufacture a plain omelette on one side of the kitchen and then lightly sprinkle on whatever ingredients right before serving it  when paying my bill at the front i was asked how was everything i replied in a polite tone ok cashier boy responds in bewilderment just ok i finally leave him with im being nice when i say ok  im sticking to taylors matts and th avenue cafe for my weekend breakfast.

hubby insisted we had eaten here before i thought not i was partly right as we have eaten at the good egg before and not been very pleased hubby had hated their crepeeggs we didnt know the connection between the two restaurants before we sat down  starving i order their farmhouse eggs benedict and hubby orders their breakfast quesadilla and an oreo pancake he just had to try it we both get iced tea and it tastes funny like it was made with bad tap water when the food arrives hubby inhales his quesadilla but says nothing about its quality the oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table i gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy the only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs the turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right its not crispy and the taste is off the biscuits taste like they are from a mix to top it off the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table nice can you at least pretend you didnt just give me the leftover water from someone elses table our server never returns to fill our tea except when dropping off the check or even to see how things are maybe he knows better than to ask.

the first time i experienced the eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room as i walked through the restaurant i was surprised it was so busyi mean this is a breakfast place right   the decor is very outdated with knick knack cutter everywhere i am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants i can see why old people love this place   i ordered the taco salad for my lunch what a disappointment almost bad iceberg lettuce a sprinkling of all other toppings no beans so if you want any protein you have to pay  extra to add chicken this salad was not worth  with a  iced tea and a  added tip to the bill i got out of there for  i will pay  for a weekday lunch but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food   yesterday i went to the eggery again with nico and his grandma after church maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch same awful decor but it seemed a bit more charming at am   i had the berry blintz crepes which were pretty good stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt mixed berries cottage cheese and a little bit of cream cheese whipped cream toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes it seemed like a lot of food for  a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad   i am not in any hurry to return to the eggery although my business group meets there every week nico did point out that i have been here twice now and have yet to actually try any egg dish maybe next time.

wow just wow as a former employee of this location im sorely disappointed i used to be a hostess here and always loved the food so i figured id take my boyfriend to grab a nice breakfast boy was i wrong i ordered the huevos rancheros with chorizo always been my favorite and ended up with eggs and bland potatoes with chunky sour cream ew and a light sprinkling of chorizo um what i paid almost  bucks for this the food was bland and not good at all i couldnt even finish my meal it was that bad ill never go back how disappointing maybe you should stop recruiting your employeeschefs from mcdonalds the good egg has really let itself go.

i love this place its walking distance from my office that service delicious fast food  its a great place to grab a quick freshly made breakfast burrito or sandwich  the lunch is very good too they have a daily special that includes a side and a drink and they have good homemade type sandwiches my personal favorites are the korean bbq sandwich and they make an awesome tuna salad sandwich  tell them i sent ya.

i like their variety in products however they always have peddlers there asking for money and making people uncomfortable but they dont seem to do anything about it  also almost every single time i go to the pharmacy they never have my prescription ready even after theyve called me to tell me it was ready one day i called it in about  days early just to make sure i could stop by anytime before i ran out to pick up my prescriptionit turned out i wasnt able to pick it up until the day that i ran out anyway and even though i had called in three days earlier it still wasnt ready to add to this frustration i have gone in and waited for up to  hours for prescription to be ready when i was told it would only take  to  minutes lastly they have the automatic prescription refill when they call you to tell you that its ready when your prescription runs out i signed up for this however they didnt call me the last time i had a refillb ready because they werent aware it needed to be refilled and the time before that they called me to tell me it was ready and when i showed up it wasnt ready im sick of waiting here and eating my time for my prescriptions i am taking my business elsewhere.

this was my first experience eating jack in the box since i moved from ga to az  days ago the service was horrible cashier had attitude when i told her i was still reviewing the menu when i was ready to place my order she was very rude  sighing as if she needed me to speed up then i watched as she prepared her food placed it on a tray  walked off as my food sat in the window the drivethru person came to see if i had been helped  proceeded to bag my food after i told him i was waiting this place needs better service.

not one but two times had to drive back around and give them back the food they handed me two times they gave me someone elses food every time i tried to check they told me they were busy and that i needed to pull forward if i wanted to check   i just wanted to try their salad   every fast food restaurant has the ability to make a decision are you going to be as bad as everyone expects or are you going to take the time to do it right  wendys of  e indian school i hope you read this moreover i hope you try harder to take the time to do it right i believe in you.

i took my phone out while walking around no photography in the store hun to which i replied that i was not i know sweetheart im just sayin theres no photography in the store honey   its hard enough being a woman that can fix her own car stuff being called pet names by strange women does not help   i contacted corporate and told them that the whole experience made me feel very uncomfortable   this is where the obviously one star review turns into a five star review the general manager was awesome in apologizing and assured me that she would receive some coaching on subtlety and proper behavior  that really makes up for it my greatest fear was that it was a given that if youre a woman in autozone youre going to encounter condescending employees i really felt like he was concerned and wanted that to not be the case  thanks for caring autozone.

filthy i ordered the oz house sirloin via delicious deliveries the delivery was very late not applebees fault and i wish we hadnt ordered from there even before i tasted my food the serving portion was small considering the amount of money id paid the mashed potatoes were filthy and the steak was like rubber if it even was steak ive had better steak from swansons frozen dinners i asked for well done not rubberized ive never had such filthy food via delivery before if i had been in the restaurant i wouldve sent it back no doubt add insult to injury they didnt even include my side of veggies so i feel completely ripped off and the food was nasty to top it off i wont be going back here again worst experience.
