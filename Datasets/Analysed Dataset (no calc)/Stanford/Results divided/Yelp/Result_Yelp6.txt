had my first visit to the saucer a few weeks ago for a trivia night beer selection is awesome and youll find the prices reasonable too menu is great and this cheesehead was very happy to see all the brat menu items including the brat nachos i started with had the chicken cheesesteak for me meal and it was pretty good though the meat to bread ratio favored the bread  as for trivia  they run a tight ship and its a blast the mc is really good and calls out all potential cheaters love it ill be back again soon when im in the university area.

what a lousy experience  perhaps there was a reason they were so unprepared but as a regular hertz gold customer i was astonished at the disorganization of this facility last thursday afternoon a bus full of travelers many gold got off the bus to find their name not on the gold sign so more than  half a dozen of us lined up outside gold office too small for more than  people to wait for one person to find us cars  finally after  mins a second person came to help  after a significant wait i was asked if i really needed a fullsized car as requested  since it was apparent something else would be quicker i took what they offered of course smaller not more luxurious the car was fine  however the return experience on friday afternoon was just as miserable  perhaps more so since i was now running late for my flight   first of all clt airport you need a traffic light at the intersection near the  hertz return entrance  it took about  mins to get across the street thankfully and airport official car coincidentally came by and let cars that needed to go straight into the lot cross   and then we waited another  mins for a bus to take us to the terminal  bad planning hertz if i didnt have tsa percheck or had to check a bag im not sure i would have made my flight   totally unacceptable service  thats an oxymoron with hertz charlotte.

i ordered general tsos chicken and beef fried rice and both were vastly subpar the chicken was tangy and had an off taste the rice was soggy and the beef was over cooked  also it took a hour and a half for the food to show up and even the egg roll was only average i will not be ordering from this place ever again and i would strongly tell anyone i know not to order from there either.

the first time my husband brought me here for dinner i thought he was out of his mind im so glad i kept an open mind it took me a few visits to find my favorite entree and now that i have im addicted my new favorite meal is the arroz con camarones shrimp w rice the onions are sweet and the shrimps are flavorful yum of all the times i have visited miguels i have never had a bad experience the servers are always attentive and nice definately give it a try.

mixed review chips and salsa were good atmosphere good i was told by my party that the chicken was good in the enchilada my food vegetarian burritocheese enchilada combo was really basic and had no imagination in flavor i was hoping to get a taqueria style burrito but what i got was small and boring flavor the guacamole was tasteless and frozen previously made it was shameful that they serve that outdoor seating option was cool and it was very popular.

i have lived near here for two years and always wanted to stop in for breakfast or lunch they dont do dinner the waitresses were very friendly and you could tell that most of the people in here were regulars bc they were all being called by name  nice touch   i ordered coffee black two eggs country ham with biscuit and grits the food came out in about  minutes and it was freshly cooked and hot the menu said their eggs are farm raised but did not ask if they were local the coffee was refilled often and they also brought out a huge glass of ice water   i love places like this look bad from the outside inside it has white and black checkered floors with red vinyl seats no frills but the food was very good   price was right too i will go back .

if yourre looking for a country breakfast this is the place  eggs the way you like them they serve up a great cup of coffee and an excellent country breakfast they serve breakfast till am  they have a good lunch menu too the greek salad is one of the best ive ever had burgers cheese steaks and sandwiches  they also have real good sweet tea serving since .

great local business servers are very attentive and run around like chickens with their heads cut off they are so busy usually this is a strange little spot but so good everything i have had from burgers to seafood was a yummy delight one of these mornings when im not working im going to go over there and have some breakfast  ive heard great things my only peeve about the restaurant is that they dont have a to go menu.

so i had to play hotel switcheroo because hyatts rate seemingly tripled for one night in the middle of my stay i wound up here and i think im officially done with choice hotels forever ive never had a positive experience aside from this one econo lodge in walterboro sc  this hotel is located in the middle of a vast array of garbage food restaurants if you want to go to a grocery store theyre all  minutes away while the hotel might be convenient to some attractions it isnt convenient to things an everyday hotel guest would need or want unless you like mcdonalds and waffle house gross  the beds are not comfortable at all and this hotel has resorted to using these god awful square  pillows who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child its beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on pair the lack of comfort with the  check out and you have one unhappy guest i requested a late checkout time upon checkin as i advised id be working overnight  was the best she could do as she made some kind of apparently phantom note the next morning at exactly  the phone rang and reminded me that i was scheduled to check out that day and that check out was  blah so much for sleeping inn at sleep inn  the hotel is quite noisy as it borders i and the immediate area isnt all that great noise from other guests was relatively nil though  the mini freezer and mini fridge were nice but it didnt make up for the overall room quality the hotel wifi averages  mbps down mbps up and is complimentary  not recommended and officially denied going forward.

dont waste your time overpriced low quality hibachi you can tell from the moment you walk in cardboard handwritten signs screaming no return not responsible for food issues that maybe you should turn around and leave i however made the mistake of staying i purchased the beef teriyaki combo which was rung up wrong and had to be fixed after i waited for my food for  mins the beef was over cooked and too lightly sauced the rice was bland and carrots overcooked into mush not worth the stomach ache i had the rest of the day.

stopped by tonight with a friend we both ordered bottled beers my bottle came with a best consumed before may   my friends beer had a due date of november  i returned my beer and ordered a draft the waiter did discount my order but i was really disappointed in their quality control not sure if this was an isolated incident but the whole experience left a bad taste.

so bad compelled me to download yelp app and write review went for lunch with family wife and  young boys weve learned to not be picky as our crew can be a little rambunctious first off in an empty restaurant we were seated directly next to the kitchen inout door next the waitress spilled water on my wife and table then when asked what the specials were i was told um not sure let me check my food turkey club was eatable but my wife salad consisted of brown lettuce the kicker is that my boys  and  didnt eat their hotdogs because they tasty yucky how can you mess up a hot dog  seems to be a good place to grab a beer and watch a game just dont eat.

i wish i had read the previous review first  my boyfriend and i were craving a cajun chicken biscuit for breakfast so he picked it up and brought it home  the chicken was so dry hard and overcooked it was like chicken jerky  didnt even taste anything like it should  we were so disappointed so he called to tell the manager and she didnt offer us a better one or anything free next time  it was just a waste of  because we couldnt eat it  they probably wont get my business again.

went to thai house on a thursday around pm  a few others were in the restaurant but not crowded at all  like other reviewers i liked the dress of the servers and the decor of the place was pretty cool  i sat in a booth by myself and was immediately greeted by the server with a menu  i ordered a green tea sakesooo good  it came in a little glass bottle and it called sakeme  i plan to buy it  as i enjoyed my sake i ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings  totally not what i expectedtwo rolllike dough things came out and it tasted like it lookedjust like raw dough stuffed with lots of crunchy lettucelike pieces and tiny chopped meat  i didnt see any shrimp not even mini shrimp  i was thinking they brought me the wrong item but when i didnt eat my dough the waiter said you dont like your shrimp dumpling i didnt have the heart or the energy after a long day of travel to say anything except i want to have room for my pad thai  so i awaited my chicken pad thai hoping it was what i am used to  the pad thai wasnt badnot great but not bad  once in a while i got the taste of mayonaisse but i was starving at this point and it did the trick  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasnt worth the risk of pad thai all over my rental car  im not sure if ill go back to thai house  i will certainly look for an alternative next time im in town  if im starved and cant find any other place ill probably give thai house another shotill just stay away from anything that says dumpling.

we loved our thai place in boston and really missed having someplace to go get pad thai we moved into the area and found this place and fell in love with it  the inside of the restaurant is beautiful and really clean the staff are all really nice and attentive they have takeout which works for us since we live a few blocks away  i thought the food was great weve tried a few different meals my wife does not enjoy very spicy food and the mild versions suit her fine i do like my food spicy and if i had one complaint its that i wouldnt mind if the spicy dishes were a little hotter than what ive experienced so far the food has great flavors and think it is spot on.

we went to nakato last night for dinner  the food was average in taste much smaller portions and higher prices than before and the service was not good at all  we waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check  my wife had to remind the waiter that she hadnt gotten her sushi order  we had a coupon and they added  for a gratuity per the coupon which we didnt see beforehand  the coupon is a scam so watch out  we wouldnt have tipped that much based on the above comments  our table mates asked for a birthday greeting which never happened  yes we have been eating here for  plus years but likely will not return as things have declined so much recently  no one ever came to our table to ask how things were going  a sign of poor customer relations.

craving thaiish and need a quick lunch hit up bangkok ocha son   i met hubs here for a very speedy lunch where their lunch special includes iced tea house soup and a noodle dish wegg roll for  oh and it comes out in about  minutes flat thats fast   and the food not too shabby the house soup is a total bust for me  its a corn egg drop soup yeah not sure where that came from but it tastes like a watered down egg chowder for me ill pass on that but i ordered the pad see ew which on their menu reads pud see ew and it was quite tasty a generous portion of chopped up flat rice noodles with a soy sauce base a bit of broccoli and bits of tender chicken considering it was lunch and i still had meetings to get to i asked for a star spice level out of  stars and it had quite a bit of heat   the service is quick and efficient and they definitely know how to turn those tables around during lunch time while its not my favorite thai food in charlotte its a nice quick and affordable option in south charlotte.

i feel like discount or bargain stores like burlington coat factory are a hit or miss sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times you miss out  ive never lucked out here  i give most stores that i see potential the rule of s you miss a truck of new goodies youre between seasons etc bcf well lets just say ive walked in  times and never bought anything not once  i think the big reason ive come away with nothing is the store setup  its so crammed and so messy  bad store planning for the layout and inconsiderate shoppers who make a disgusting mess  i did give an extra star for the staff theyve always been friendly and helpful which always means a lot to me  id rather go anywhere else but bcf  check the sale racks at belk or head to ross before you consider here.

my wife and i ate here this evening for our th anniversary  the interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations the menu had also changed with some items doubling in price  a coworker of my wife had given her a  gift card for christmas we ordered sweet teas and a bloomin onion the onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning  my wife had the chicken tenders and i had the pork tenderloin  it wa a good but wasnt outstanding at one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table he didnt introduce himself he asked about our meal and disappeared i told the waiter about him we were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the french toast bread pudding looked delicious.

great way to spend the th  been awhile since ive been to outback and they have revamped the menu a bit  slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings also at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well  my wife had here favortie alice springs chicken  normally i would go with a beef entree but opted for a new offering of parmesan herb crusted chicken with a side of mixed vegetable  only negative was the bread they served it was a very dark bread that looked with an eastern european bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor  fortunately that was the only downside  my parmesan herb crusted chicken was great  the flavors and textures complimented themselves well  my wife was also happy with her alice springs chicken which again is her normal order at outback  service was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign  atmosphere  what can i say  typical outback  if youre in the carolina place mall area this is a nice spot for dinner and now lunch.

this is now called cabos mexican grill   this is the nd time visiting and nd time being disappointed the first time i went with a group of  other friends the service was less than okay and food was mediocre nothing really memorable  the nd time was a couple of weeks ago name change but the bad service stayed  went with a group of about    people on a thursday night right of the top we realized that the waiter was less than eager to serve us we ordered drinks and our food food took longer than what we expected even with a big group the server never filled up our water glasses and kept forgetting things we asked for to make matters worse the manager seemed to notice our struggles so he came over and asked what we needed we told him and to our surprise he never came back with what we asked worst part we were so ready to leave and couldnt our checks where laying at a table next to us but we must have waited  minutes for our waiter to show up and pick them up   i am rating it  stars because the place was clean and the food here might have been okay but the terrible service didnt let us enjoy it.

this week i took my son to see the chipmunks squeakquel or whatever its called weve been here several times before since it is in the university city area near where we live   there is plenty of parking lines for tickets are usually long and uncomfortable in the cold blowing wind of december or the humid summer heat for that matter why cant they put the ticket counters on the insides of theaters this is one tradition that should be broken soon  matinee tickets for the two of us were    the theater itself is in good shape movies are usually in focus and the sound is usually okay with some distortion but not great frankly dvds sound better in my living room  but concessions are a complete ripoff i usually know this but jay talked me into it we got a medium huge popcorn two small bladderbusting drinks and a box of twizzlers twenty friggin bucks im sure the dvd wouldnt cost  to buy and we could watch it over and over i doubt well be buying it the movie is grade b entertainment funny once but pretty stupid to watch as a rerun  the restroom had no paper towels and the trash cans were overflowing a smell of stale vomit permeated the area by the sinks   for a family i think money spent on a large lcd tv and a home theater in a box sound system is a wise investment rent movies from red box or netflix or hook up an apple tv or something similar and you have a better movienotgoing experience   i can make much better and less expensive popcorn and the adults and i can have a beer and i can pause the movie for those allimportant lets all go to the lobby breaks  every time i go to the theater to see a flick on the big screen im more and more disappointed by the experience i guess a lot of others feel the same way since the theater we were in was nearly empty  its a pit.

my new coworkers invited me to go get cheap mexican with them for lunch now from where i work you could walk to more skeevy run down looking hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand and im pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be unfortunately i can not report on any of them because we drove by them and went to zapatas  i wont say that zapatas was bad partially because i dont think it is deserved and partially because it feels like i am giving credit for more effort than they earned while the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor that was the high point of the meal we ate off the lunch menu and i went with the enchilada and taco plate the meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful the taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf the rice was bland and slightly overcooked i do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty but nothing i wouldnt expect from a jarred sauce the low point was definitely the refried beans which are often my favorite part i took one mouthful found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad cold congealed mess  i have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal well in that case creepy unpleasant service can cement a bad impression despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over he gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break  the only reason i can imagine returning to zapatas would be at my coworkers request and even then i might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich i brought from home oh and as for that cheap bit the lunch pricing is in the  dollar range which isnt particularly remarkable when there are tacos to be found for under  bucks.

umno  chips are obviously from bags  salsa were runny and definitely not spicy  remember  made in new york city  i had the carne asada  it was ok  i usually devour the entire place but i just couldnt get into it  the rice was bland  overall it was just disappointing  i should have just eaten at qdoba which was nearby  service was mediocre   moral just because it is right next to the hotel doesnt mean food is gonna be awesome.

my family visited the restaurant recently there was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family the manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional we are hard working people we expect good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly we have never been treated so disrespectfully there was not even an offer of im sorry for the misunderstandingattention all managers being apologetic in the face of controversy doesnt suggest a weakness there was not even an attempt to right the wrong we work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation my level of disappointment can not be expressed any further than sayingthis was really awful treatment of guests in your restaurant no words.

i was hoping the previous reviewer had merely had a bad stay andor the property had updated since then but no such luck  the beds here are rocks  it felt like i was sleeping on a box spring instead of a mattress and a really had and painful one at that  when we got up in the morning that phrase in quotations as it implies we had a good nights sleep which we didnt my husband pointed out that the side of the mattress was slumping so it was probably very old  definitely not marriott standard  wireless internet was slow but a cat was provided in the room for laptops that got internet up to speed just fine  breakfast when i had it was good  perhaps previous reviewer came down late  a little on the crowded side but the biscuits were delicious  all in all the stay was great except for the beds but unfortunately thats a huge thing that needs to be good when youre staying at a hotel  sorry guys.

we went on a friday night as packed as it looked we actually went right in and got a table the waitress was good and always on point with service   as for the food i ordered the jack daniels ribs and shrimp the shrimp were really good as for the ribs they showed you shouldnt order ribs unless its a bbq place they were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water my wife ordered the steak sadly a majority of that oz consisted of nothing but fat   to top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass they were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldnt hear your own self think i dont mind people being loud but cmon you dont go to a restaurant and get blitzed but from the way it seemed the manager and servers acted like its an everyday thing so what do i know i was just eating there   eating there made me realize why i never actually go eat there nor do i really plan on going anytime soon.

i met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great chain or otherwise the food was blah first we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten which they sort of honored at least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived  our waitress was the only shining star  she did a good job of taking care of  people with  separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled she was also helpful in getting a couple of the tvs switched over to the panthers game they lost  we had a few appetizers for the table the pretzel bones were good served with a couple of different sauces as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces if you like cheese fries try the fire stix which were the best part of the meal  having read the reviews i knew to stay away from the brisket i went with a lunch sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast it was dry and not much more than warm after we asked the waitress brought out the bbq sauces which improved the bland taste the fire roasted corn was good  a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty the mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well especially when i mixed it with the corn.

had the opportunity to visit smokey bones this week i had the rib  chicken white meat they were out of dark meat combo it was actually pretty good however the worst part of this dining experience was the host who was suppose to great us when we came through the door he started off by saying just  as though  people was not enough well i can appreciate some good hospitality and a welcoming personality before patronizing a restaurant that i dont frequent very often.

this was a bad experience from the start the hostes told me that there was a one hour wait even though the dining room was half empty twenty minutes into my wait two parties came in and were seated while i waited after complining i was seated  ordered a salad and ribs the salad was good the ribs were as tough as leather the baked potato had to be broken with fork and knife since it probably had been baking for hours  the only good thing about the experience was the server which was very attentive and appologized profusely for the innedible food.

everything about this place screams a budget hotel except for the price   this is a motel quality establishment charging upscale hotel quality prices    granted the staff is nice  and if you need a place that allows pets i guess this could be a good choice   otherwise dont be fooled   i have staid at other homewood suites in the past and this one is certainly not up to par.

ill cut right to the tender juicy heart of longhornits a great chain steakhouse and as far as i am concerned it puts outback to shame  their steak and service are just flatout better in my mind than outback  i am not an outback hater or anything its just than when i tell people about longhorn the response i usually get is why dont you just go to outback  well heres what keeps me coming back to longhorn instead  steaks are always juicy tender and cooked to perfection  ive never had a bad or less than satisfactory steak at longhorn  i usually order the oz flos filet  dont worry oz of quality steak is more than what you think and is more than enough for most people see pics    i love the crab and lobster dip see pics  i order this almost every time i go here  i dont know if the crab and lobster are imitation or not and to be honest i really dont care  all i know is that it is a stellar appetizer and puts the overrated blooming onion to shame as far as appetizers go  i love the mashpotatoes  i just wish they would cut back on the butter a little bit  i mean we all love butter but no ones trying to sacrifice their life for it  i recommend asking for lite butter on the mashpotatoes if you choose to order them as a side to go with your entree  i love the brown bread that they serve before the meal  its good but its better when its warm and fresh and ive had some nonfresh bread before  i cant say that the bread is consistently better than outbacks  the service is always topnotch  everyone from the hostess to the manger to the servers are extremely friendly and polite  drinks are always promptly refilled and orders are always correct    they do serve a few select beers on draft such as bud light and blue moon but beware they arent cheap and can turn a reasonably priced dinner into an expensive one very quickly  in recent visits i have tried to stay away from the alcoholic beverages while there    theres nothing not to like about longhorn  reasonable prices great food and awesome servicewhat else do you need.

i seem to always get up sold whenever i go to an autobell the problem is i spend more money thinking i will get better service but it is never the case with autobell this location was no different stick with the normal cleaning packages and it is well worth the money buy their upgrades and it is a waste.

we went here for lunch last week the place is very small cramped they only have like  little tables that seat two people and one that sits four the place was completely packed as it was lunch hour in the galleria area service was slow and kinda confusing  they were out of several items specifically cilantro which was one of the main ingredients in beckys sub the problem wasnt that they were out but that they failed to tell her this until the sub was in midproduction  mine was fine as far as production and taste but for a toasted sub it was barely warm  not that this is their fault as they only serve it but stay away from the honey lemonade they have its disgusting  the place was fairly clean and well stocked and organized the staff were friendly the two main sandwich guys spoke very little english so i had to repeat my order a couple of times to confused looks to boot they sandwich guys spoke different languages from each other so you can tell there was some confusion and even a little bickering back and forth not major but noticeable  not awful but they can improve.

this goodwill is probably the busiest in charlotte and has aboveaverage selection in each dept  they have good variety of clothes shoes books furniture and housewares  the selling point at this store as you might have guessed by reading my views is the book selection  unlike other stores they have a steady rotation of new titles nearly new for really cheap  im regularly surprised by their furniture selection  if my house wasnt cluttered like your grandmas crib i would pick up a table or even a couch here  also this place is freakin mecca for used appliances  i always see a selection of used microwaves coffee makers and blenders  the clothes are nice not as nice as the matthews plantation but you can still find some amazing deals on brand name clothes    please be warned saturdays is not a good day to shop due to crowds of crying screaming children  plus you wouldnt want to get in altercation with aggressive shoppers over a  beer stein  try a weekday before  or so  happy treasure hunting.

pizza has a great flavor and the spaghetti with meat sauce has great flavor only too little sauce  if you see my photos you may say it looks like a lot  the service here is always very good  i have to say im a fan because i eat here more than any italian place.

i went to cute nails over the weekend it was my third nail salon that i have frequented in the charlotte area this place paled in comparison to the other two it was a decent environment inside the pedicure i got was only  which is a good price as someone else mentioned the water was very hot the chairs are old and not very effective at massaging my chair cut off after about five minutes and would not go back on i am also used to a foot massageleg massage as part of my typical pedicure experience she did not do this but she did punch my feet a few times each that was a little out of what i am used to she did scrape off my dead skin but she did it very lightly and left more skin on than i prefer i am missing some nail polish on the corners of my nails they are also cut kind of crooked my eyebrow waxing experience wasnt so great either she did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner my left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out i dont imagine being back people who worked there were nice though.

we ordered from them mid day during the week for delivery  it took  hours and our pizza was cold  we were told by the manager that they would give us a free pizza  we called back a few days later to order and there was no record of the incident  we will never return.

this is a great bar if you have kids i know that sounds weird but listen they have a beach  and tiki bar in the rear with cornhole beer pong ping pong horseshoes etc they have a stage out there for live music big portions of food for not alot of cash becoming a friday night tradition.

i will not return terrible customer service i ordered a pizza from here because i had received a welcome packet with some coupons including one for demarcos giving a free large  topping pizza dine in or take out i called and ordered then went to pick it up upon doing so the hostess told me the owner wasnt accepting these coupons and its only good with a  or something purchase the coupon was newly received so this wasnt news to the owner he just didnt pull them per the hostess which seems like a scam to me i politely argued with the girl telling her it doesnt give stipulations anywhere and thats false advertising not even sure if thats legal and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers like myself she understood but it was the owners call i ended up purchasing the pizza needed to eat and the pizza wasnt good it had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt because im pregnant i opted not to get too stressed so after stating my views i left vowing that i wont return which is unfortunate because its very close to my home but there are too many other places close enough with better food and certainly better service.

tried again and it was worse  i didnt like it  ordered a combo plate beef burrito soft taco and tostada took most of it home to try and remake it but it was hopeless just not good food.

unlimited hot coffee i dont have any recollection of what i ate  i wanted t give it four stars but that would be a very generous review for a meal i cannot recall  i know it was decently good and its like the only restaurant in deforest  for that i give it four stars.

there should be a negative rating on here  one star is way to high i am sick and tired of how the cable box is never working their solution keep resetting the box yes it is my job to make sure i get my serivce on a daily basis  its not theirs to make sure it work  plus they have poor customer service but i dont blame the people that answer the phones but the people who st the rules to nickel and dime its customers   charter is horrible and since i coudnt get thru to complain on the phone here is my truth  charter is the worst.
  Negative
ate there last night with a group of friends  the waitstaff was friendly but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night  i hate french onion soup that was so salty it tasted like a salt lick  plus they put so many croutons in the soup i was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up  i ordered the bluegill for my main dish  being an avid fisherman i can appreciate some good wisconsin bluegill  this bluegill however was not good  it was cold and tasted very old  the fries that went along with it were also extremely salty  a couple people in the group said their food was okay but definitely not worth a trip back  i was quite bummed about this.

fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me  i went there a second time because i couldnt remember if i liked the food or not yesit was that unremarkable upon going there the second time i knew there would not be a third ever   i know this is madison but cmon ive had more authentic chinese food at panda express what should have been an immediate tipoff was the fact that there werent any chinese words on the menuand that all the clientele was white again yes i know this is madison but this is compared to other chinese restaurants like fugu or ichiban i dont actually remember the specific dishes i ordered ive had fish chicken pork and beef there but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months dry and flavorless   the service was also slow they refilled our glasses only once after we had asked for the check  i wont be going back.

i live on the east side of madison and i always eat at the imperial gardens near e washington and this imperial was a let down the restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff wasnt as amazing as i hoped for   for starters the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down my friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a weird sort of sour after taste i had the pepper steak and i did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also had a strange after taste  the staff was very kind but a little annoying its was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us we could then see her staring at us from across the room waiting to start another unwanted conversation  imperial garden middleton will definitely be memorable but for all the wrong reasons.
  Negative
i really enjoyed my dinner here i had a fantastic fajita platter which included beef chicken shrimp and the requisite peppers and onions but also whole scallions and tomato wedges delicious the guacamole was decent though a little bland and my husbands mole sauce was just ok but i really liked the spicy salsa they brought to the table when i requested it  the service was pretty grea.
  Positive
i have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store  today i tried going back after a year and again the staff is so unhelpful unknowledgeable and downright rude  i called to talk with the manager and her attitude is just as bad  which i guess explains the attitudes of the staff  there are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers.

this is a nice looking but poorly designed hotel despite having over  rooms they only have  elevators i was here for a convention with a friend who recently had foot surgery and needed a wheelchair lets just say other hotel guests were not gracious about giving us priority on the elevators even though we were on the second floor and even the largest of humans should be able to manage  flight of stairs with  good feet checkout was a nightmare because of this elevator situation fortunately a staff member was kind enough to allow us access to the service elevator after he saw how rude the guests were about this  the food is also terrible and overpriced several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari that was no fun for anybody i highly recommend the sprecher brewery restaurant across the street  comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food   the temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well our room was cold no matter how high we adjusted the thermstat and the convention space was hot enough that i nearly fainted on at least  occasions the only reason this hotel gets  stars is because it was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable with their downfilled duvets and fluffy pillows.

does not live up to a recent review in madison paper   cons too pricey  ala carte  the pasta dishes in range   the entrees    the decor needs fresh paint and new carpet  and the restroom slightly grotty server forgot to put in some of our order  my ravioli vin santo was lacking flavor  need to serve parmesan cheese with the bread  oil plus nice people  good tuscan mushroom soup for the tiny storefront family restaurant it is priced too high which sets your expectations higher and does not live up to those expectations  it would be fine for your corner italian joint for everyday meals if they offered a salad with the meal and cut their .

do not go here had my oil changed on  as i left the lot i pulled out onto university ave and my car immediately died i turned around and headed back to jiffy lube to see what the problem could be as my car was fine prior to the oil change they took my car and said they ran a complete diagnostic test and said that my spark plugs needed to be changed and that my battery was bad they immediately said we have a guy would you like us to call him i felt like i was being scammed how can my car be completely fine prior to the oil change and then after the oil change i now need new spark plugs and possibly a new battery i declined their offer to call their guy and decided to take the chance and drive home   once home i took my car to my local garage which i should have done in the first place and they informed me that jiffy lube failed to put the air filter on correctly after they changed my oil considering all jiffy lube does is change oil i feel placing the air filter on correctly is something they do in their sleep so the so called diagnostic test that they ran was probably a load of bs and all they wanted to do was scam me into having their guy fix my unbroken car which probably would have cost me an arm and leg shame on you jiffy lube just remember someone is more likely to share a bad customer service experience than a good one you can bet i will be sharing this bad one.

i love the capital brewery because i think it encompasses everything that is quintessentially wisconsin capital brewery makes consistently highquality german lagers with a few good ales thrown in for good measure and provides a lowkey nofrills environment that can be whatever you want it to be the beer garden bier garten is huge filled with weatherbeaten picnic tables and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun trees insulate the place and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as westside andy and the mel ford band people bring their kids their dogs decks of cards and board games and enjoy the excellent beer thats doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff bring your own food  some local joints like the roman candle will even deliver right to your picnic table and if the weathers not so nice you can visit the bier stube capitals indoor bar which is full of dark rich wood and nice people i highly recommend the capital brewery and dont forget to take the short tour.

my wifes mini cooper had to have its engine replaced she no longer felt comfortable driving that car we visited nissan honda toyota and vw dealerships and ultimately had the best experience with zimbrick vw in middleton otto was very helpful he was not pushy and gave us all the information we needed to make a decision  zimbrick made a very fair offer to trade in the mini but we ended up selling it ourselves once my wifes car was sold otto made the process very quick and easy so we had her in her new passat the same day he even stayed after closing to walk her through setting up her new car  when i replace my toyota rav i will definitely consider zimbrick vw.

i dont know what it is about this place but they are slooooooooow the food is adequate please dont lecture me about fast food why are you even reading this review but sitting at the drivein will shorten your life or maybe just feel like it   i prefer some of their stuff to mcdonalds yes im very discerning but just cannot abide the wait.

this review is strictly based on the sun prairie location and is only a review on the service received not the food i have had papa murphys pizza at other locations and the pizza was good unfortunately at this location i wasnt given a chance to get a pizza i walked into the store at  minutes to pm pm is when they close not only did my phone my car and my watch indicate that it was before pm but the actual clock inside the store was showing  i soon as i walked into the restaurant i was told that they were closed even though there was another customer in the store getting a pizza as well you dont even bake the pizza how much effort would it have been to take one more order and make one more pizza the total transaction could have been done and it still probably wouldnt have been  its not like the store had already been cleaned and it would have been a hassle to reopen everything i would have been completely understanding of that there are a lot of pizza options in sun prairie go there.

classic just like you remember  perhaps like me you remember trips to the aw as a kid on a hot summer day to get that enormous frosty mug of sweet cold root beer as a special treat  i remember agonzing over the decision ice cream cone or frosty mug of beer parents wouldnt let us have both   i hadnt stopped into an aw in a long long time and was looking for something a little less fastfoody on my drive south when i decided to stop at this aw  ive driven by it on the interstate a hundred times on my way back and forth from minneapolis to madison but had never before stopped in  i got a burger and fries which were fine but the real treat was a real frosty mug eat in only that i could fill myself at the beverage counter with straight from the barrel aw root beer  now that was a really something special.

when i was younger my aunt and uncle and cousins lived in kenosha wi  we would drive up a few times a year to visit them and after  hours of peering out the car windows along  my brother and cousins and i would be dying to get out of the car at any of the attractions along the waysix flags the outlet malls or any of the many cheese shops that announced your arrival to wisconsin    when i went skiing with friends at cascade mountain last winter years of unfulfilled longing swept over me and i demanded that we stop at one  the one we selected was the mousehouse cheesehaus chosen mostly for its cute sign and awesome name  being a lover of all things dairy walking in i beelined for the cheese counter demanding samples of anything and everything  oh my  anything from a basic kid friendly american to a  year aged cheddar to their own special haus cheese  i probably walked out with a good  lbs of various cheeses and am still wondering how those seemed to add  lbs to my figure but thats another story  in addition there were the usual wisconsin knick knacks including many types of beers wines and other kitschy stuff like ashtrays and bottle openers  the woman working at the counter didnt seem too charmed by my friends and i but im sure i would tire of travelers demanding cheese nibbles after a while myself.

although the staff was friendly and the language was not a barrier for me as it was for others the food i got was not very good after i ordered the general tsos chicken the woman turned on the fryer and without waiting for the oil to heat up she put in the chicken and my crab rangoon therefore when i ate the food it wasnt crispy as a good general tsoscrab rangoon  should be another thing that i noticed was that the chicken that she put in the fryer was sitting on the counter in the heat note she hadnt fried any in quite some time which is why she had to turn the fryer on the person that said the food was too sweet was right even though the menu said spicy for my meal there was no zip at all take it for what its worth but i know i will be looking for another restaurant to get my take out from now on.

i could visit this place four times and give it four different reviews today there was a long wait at the cutting table which was at first staffed by three different people the little numbergivingout machine was empty so we all just stood in an orderly line one of the women at the cutting table left right after i got there there were five of us in line then saying that she was already late for her break i didnt like to see her go but i understood about the break thing sometimes you really need your break and sometimes your manager really wants you to take your break at the scheduled time   it took a long time to get my stuff cut because one women kept cutting but the other one was helping a customer track down some numbers on a fabric if i was that customer id have been thrilled at that level of service   so i finally got my stuff cut the woman cutting it was very efficient but i think a little rattled from being so busy and admired my choice of fabric hey i love to be validated   i went up front and stood in line some more there were unusually three different people working the registers the woman who checked me out was mellow and chatty and also admired my fabric im starting to think its not my great taste but some new policy   so not a great visit but not the worst either.

at my first visit this month dr radke and her assistants were wonderful i never had to wait long and most importantly radke really addressed my eye allergies a new phenomenon for me as a recent wisco resident and pointed me toward some new contacts that are amazingly comfortable  i really like that they offer optomap as an alternative to dilating your eyes it isnt covered under insurance but the cost is well worth avoiding dilation eye drops in my book.
