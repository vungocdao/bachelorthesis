mathematically speaking this book is all nonsense for instance the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning this is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home he argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage but the details he left out just to make his useless point is the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month whereas the person who doesnt own a home has to pay may be k per year for rent that wipes out the savings that the author is claiming not only that that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord whereas the owner of the home builds equitymy recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book else you will be screwed if you follow his advice.

i bought the book because i read the review and it look interesting and funny but after the first pages i knew that this was a mistake is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time.
  Negative
i didnt really like the book if the author didnt write the sex portion of the book there would not have been much to write about what happened with nick and the law suit it was barely mentioned she could have written more about that and less the descriptive sex.
  Negative
awesome simply awesome i couldnt put this down and laughed smiled and even got tears a brand new favorite author.
  Positive
this was a really fun read the dialogue was witty and clever i really enjoyed the progression of the romance it probably could have been tied up a little sooner the last th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced i do wish more of nick and rachels storyline had been included just because i enjoyed their banter and potential i recommend to any modern romance fan.

great this is a kent henry praise and worship classic  you can not go wrong with this one do not sleep on kent henry ive mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders this man is gifted anointed and sings many spontanious praise and worship songs although there are no spontanious songs on this one his cds from his independent labels are loaded with them he has a talent for ushering believers into gods presencethe songs are a mixture of upbeat and mellow classics this is a must have this cd is out of print and if you can get your hands on one  do it quickly.

first thing i noticed about this book was that the pages were stuck together no reallythey were the printer did not get it right when they cut the edges of this book there were many pages that had to be hand cut just to turn them i could not stand the  design then once i get everything readable i find that the information herein is oh about  years old and totally useless for current midi applicationsmight be ok if you are looking for a history of midi and want to spent an hour making the book readable by cutting the uncut pages so that you can actually read them.

this cd has instrumental experimental jazz and near trance synthesizer pieces some of the rhythm patterns have a latin flavor and feel very danceable others remind me of chill out lounge music a few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground i enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background i have not heard the other volumes in the series and so i cannot compare them with each other my only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent some are more mellow and some are more lively but the mood of the cd is more consistent than a lot of collections i have heard some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies two of them felt slightly dissident to me but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing.

we bought this emer galilieo vacuum cleaner for about  more than one year ago the retractable cord broke after a short time we had to send the vacuum to nj to get it repaired by using the warranty after a month they sent it back with the same problem and the onoff button was broken as well i called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one this vacuum is very powerful however the handle hose is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use by considering its high price i guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner.

donal cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction i find his book to be biased towards the murphydolan faction poorly researched claiming that billy the kid was known as michael mccarty and his findings to be very questionable presents evidence without veryfiable sourcesafter reading this book i asked myself why did cline write this book he seems to not think to much of billy the kid so why write a book about him why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about james dolan and lg murphy.

the biggest problem with this dvd is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on jamess brake line the episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the dvd it would have taken like  more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order other than that it is a good dvd with  thomas and friends stories in which james is prominent i have a personal complaint too i purchased this in a store not online even though the box said it includes a bonus wooden train my box actually had a take along bertie in it my son didnt have a bertie so i was eager to get it but i didnt realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series my son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better.

the set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oillike substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous also the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened or dulled however you look at it i have difficulties cutting through even thin soft silicone sheets sharpening them with a rotary tool helps but i feel i shouldnt have to do that with a brand new product which i am sure is actually repackaged i cant imagine using them for metal let alone most rubbers despite the very affordable price i would not have purchased this set for the above reasons.

first things first homespun is an album of demos for apple venus if you dont have that record look there first although if youre new to xtc skylarking is the usual recommendationso a collection of demos what to expect essentially its a trackbytrack match for apple venus sonically you couldnt tell its so much a set of demos except in a couple places frivolous tonight because it sounds so complete in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes even in places you wouldnt expect it like orchestral workouts river of orchids and green manis it interesting yeah extremely and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original knights in shining karma but truth to be told unless youre a diehard you probably dont need to hear the work versions of this material more casual fans definitely want to check out apple venus its a fine record.

we had two beloved cats die during my childs fifth year and i wanted a book that dealt with death frankly but gently this book doesnt promise eternal life or give any religious message in several different ways and using different living things as examples the book communicates that death is a natural part of life my girl has even requested this book a couple times at bedtime which i found slightly surprising.
  Positive
as a public school librarian i would say that lifetimes is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child or children in dealing with the subject of death however as a person of faith i would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after deaththe text states nothing that is alive goes on living for ever this statement either reflects the authors intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death or it could be interpreted as their belief statement this is why id suggest that lifetimes be read by or shared with a caring adult who would be able to answer a childs questions based on a familys belief system.

i had expected or at least hoped for a more or less straightforward account of the mothman phenomenon of some  years ago instead this meandering book comprises hick ufo sightings that are only infrequently connected with mothman and keels trustmei knowwhatimtalkingabout theories and explanations i was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men in black behaving badly with little to recommend it and aside from providing some details on the mothman sightings theres no other recommendation the mothman prophecies is a considerable disappointment.
  Negative
let me just start by saying that the  mothman prophecies is not a novel nor is it a coherent story it starts strong just enough to draw you in then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole were led to believe that mr keel is a sensiable unbiased investigator when really hes a parinoid delusional whack im only  and i dont buy a word of it see the movie instead.

although i prefer books with an actual plot i dont mind reading choppy journaltype entries if there is actually a point to all of it or if at least such entries are entertaining this books are albeit only in the beginning after a while youll begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if thats just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing stylethis book wasnt worth the timeor the title theres hardly anything about the mothman in it.

i really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art instead i found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever she repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book she reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that i stopped caring about her situation her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they dont really lead to anything of interest later on her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves the title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother aside from her death during childbirth i am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book sadly.
  Negative
this has got to be one of the most depressing books i have ever read not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing which it was but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality this was the first book i attempted to read by the author since i couldnt waste my time trying to finish it i am pretty sure i wont be reading any other books by jamaica kincade.

ill make this short and to the point im quite the avid reader but usually i dont enjoy books of this nature opting for fantasy and scifi escapism instead this story is just beautifully told though the subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner i was hooked immediately i honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book and i urge you to give it a shot i know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more adventure action type books but there is no lack of excitement here.
  Negative
for oxford university press there are quite a few annoying typos i can see how the new forsyte by the name scames or the unlisted french word ficbe came about as a result of faulty character recognition but how soames born in  got to be thirtyeight in in  is beyond me dont they have proofreaders anymoreby all means read the bookyou may find out how a lot of later works of literature derive from itbut not in this edition.

my review centers on only one thing  the type size this edition is disappointingly and in my humble opinion unnecessarily small increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and at most increase the book length by about a hundred pages since it is currently at almost  pages i feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another  pages with no problemwhat makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldnt require a magnifying glass if it was just a little largeri really dont believe our lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read his wor.

a few years back i was forced to read tess for my english class nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book only a few of us could ever even finish the cliff notes for it our professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into ittess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women yes even at that time this book is overrated and should not be called a classic if you really want to read good literature read dhlawrence read tolstoy read evn modern classical writers like achebe but for crying out loud do not waste your time and money on tess.

this was one of the worst books i have ever read it goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place.

hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society they are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending he had created a virtuous women in the form of tess and ends her as a criminal it is impossible for a women of tesss virtue to turn into a criminal i would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from depression.
  Negative
tess was a very boring book from an analytical point the books major theme was fate however you must be interested in the victorian era in order to enjoy the book it is the same thing with the scarlet letter to enjoy the book you must know about the time era the problems that the characters are faced with in the book are laughable by todays standards.

i read this book soon after i had seen the ae miniseries reading the book after watching the series gave me a better appreciation for the dialects hardy uses throughout the novel which could be a little difficult to decipher very good book overall.
